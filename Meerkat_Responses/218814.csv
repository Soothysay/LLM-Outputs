   75F with dm, afib with a/c, ?pulm htn with home O2, presented to ED
   with change in mental status. Work-up of sepsis was negative, and
   patient is normotensive since admission, on abx. Most likely
   explanation is iatrogenic hypoglycemia, followed by hypothermia.
   Hypotension seems to be related to lower bp in one arm compared to
   another. Patient reports feeling well, at baseline. The etiology of
   hypoglycemia is unclear. Infection is certainly a concern, but none
   discovered thus far. She has had prior episodes of hypoglycemia in the
   past, though never this severe. Patient education seems to be crucial
   in this case.

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation with a cardiac arrhythmia, and pulmonary hypertension who presented to the emergency department with a change in mental status. The patient was found to be hypoglycemic and hypotensive, but has since stabilized with normal blood pressure. The work-up for sepsis was negative, and the patient has been on antibiotics. The most likely explanation for the hypoglycemia is iatrogenic hypoglycemia, followed by hypothermia. The patient's hypotension seems to be related to lower blood pressure in one arm compared to the other. The patient reports feeling well at baseline. The etiology of the hypoglycemia is unclear, but infection is a concern. The patient has had prior episodes of hypoglycemia in the past, although never this severe. Patient education is crucial in this case.

The patient's current conditions include hypoglycemia, hypotension, and hypothermia. The potential medical complications that can arise include further episodes of hypoglycemia, worsening hypotension, and potential infections."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and pulmonary hypertension. She presented to the emergency department with a change in mental status and was found to be hypoglycemic. The patient also experienced hypotension, which improved with intravenous fluids, and hypothermia. Her work-up for sepsis was negative. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving antibiotics, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 121/56 mmHg, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving arterial line monitoring and is expected to be transferred to the floor later in the day if her condition remains stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of prior episodes of hypoglycemia, and the etiology of this episode is unclear. It is important to monitor her blood glucose levels closely and adjust her insulin dosage accordingly.
2. Hypothermia: The patient is experiencing hypothermia, which can be potentially life-threatening if not treated promptly. Active warming measures should be implemented to raise her body temperature.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and it is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea with pulmonary hypertension, and prior urinary retention. She was admitted for altered mental status, which was precipitated by hypoglycemia and is now resolved. The patient also had hypothermia and hypotension, which are believed to be caused by hypoglycemia. Her vital signs are stable, and her blood culture and urine culture have been sent. She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics.

Plan:
- Stop the antibiotics
- Continue levothyroxine and outpatient thyroid-stimulating hormone follow-up
- Follow-up thyroid-stimulating hormone
- Monitor blood sugar levels
- Continue insulin sensitivity training
- Hold sulfonamides upon discharge

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, so she will restart beta-blockers and warfarin.
Her diabetes is controlled, and she will resume home antihypertensives tomorrow.
The patient is advised to follow a regular diet, and she does not require intravenous fluids as her electrolytes are normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia, which can be potentially life-threatening if not promptly treated. It is important to monitor blood sugar levels regularly.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM) on insulin who presented to the ICU with hypoglycemia, dehydration, and no access to sugar. She was also experiencing hypotension and hypothermia but has since resolved. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and was restarted on her home medications, which improved her condition. She is currently stable and awaiting transfer to the floor. The patient's hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia have all resolved. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Re-occurrence of hypoglycemia if the patient does not have access to sugar or if her insulin dosage is not adjusted properly.
2. Dehydration due to inadequate fluid intake or ongoing losses.
3. Recurrence of hypotension if the patient's blood pressure is not adequately managed.
4. Persistent hypothermia if the patient's body temperature is not monitored and maintained within normal limits.
5. Complications related to AF, such as stroke or heart failure, if the patient's heart rhythm is not effectively managed.
6. Infection or sepsis if the patient develops an infection while in the ICU.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and prolonged bed rest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with pulmonary hypertension, and prior urinary retention.
- She presented for evaluation of altered mental status, which was precipitated by hypoglycemia. Her mentation status is now resolved.
- The patient experienced hypothermia and hypotension, likely due to hypoglycemia. Her blood pressure and temperature are currently within normal limits.
- Blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained, and she is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
- Random cortisol levels were within normal range, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated, but thyroxine (T4) levels were normal.
- Levothyroxine is being continued, and outpatient TSH follow-up is planned.
- Hypoglycemia was likely caused by exogenous insulin. Blood sugar levels are now in the normal range. Insulin-sensitizing substances (ISS) will be continued, and sulfonamides will be held upon discharge.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She is on beta-blockers (BB), diltiazem, and warfarin. Warfarin was held due to an INR of 3.0 yesterday, and will be restarted when INR <"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, which is ongoing. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was on warfarin therapy prior to admission. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from 101/33 mmHg to 137/89 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 71 to 131 beats per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is stable at 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 98%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.8 degrees Celsius.

The patient has received several doses of intravenous diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has been given oral diltiazem as well. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the current symptoms of hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient's lab results show an elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a low sodium level of 135 mEq/L. The white blood cell count has been fluctuating, ranging from 3.9 to 6.9 K/uL. The patient's hemoglobin level is 25.0 g/dL, and the platelet count is within normal limits, ranging from 90 to 110 K/uL."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea with pulmonary hypertension, and prior urinary retention. She presented with altered mental status, which was determined to be precipitated by hypoglycemia. Her hypothermia and hypotension were likely caused by hypoglycemia as well. The patient's blood glucose levels are now within the normal range. She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status: Resolved, possibly precipitated by hypoglycemia.
2. Hypothermia and hypotension: Likely scenario is hypoglycemia, hypotension, and hypothermia. Blood pressure and temperature are stable, and blood cultures and urine cultures are negative. Continue insulin sensitivity testing and outpatient thyroid-stimulating hormone follow-up.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is on beta-blockers, diltiazem, and warfarin. Warfarin was held due to an INR of 3.0. Restart warfarin when INR is less than 3 at a dose of 3 mg per day.
4. Diabetes mellitus: Controlled with insulin sensitivity testing.
5. Hypertension: Controlled, resume home antihypertensives tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), and atrial fibrillation. She presented with hypoglycemia due to poor access to sugar and had a hospital course complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR) in the setting of holding her home medications.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension (not in shock), hypothermia, and hypoglycemia. She experienced transient desaturation this morning while sleeping without her usual CPAP. The chest X-ray reveals a right lower lobe infiltrate, indicating a possible lung infection. The patient is at risk for atelectasis due to her large abdomen and being in bed for several days. 

The assessment and plan include continuing to restart home medications, starting levofloxacin 750 mg orally daily (although it is not adequate treatment for truly hospital-acquired pneumonia), and continuing warfarin therapy while closely monitoring the INR due to antibiotic use.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be managed, glycemic control will be maintained using regular insulin sliding scale, and she will have appropriate lines inserted. Prophylaxis measures include systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and elevation of the head of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with hypoglycemia due to poor access to sugar. During her hospital course, she experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR) while holding her home medications. However, her rate control has improved.

The patient had a transient desaturation episode this morning while sleeping without her usual continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). A chest X-ray revealed right lower lobe infiltrate, indicating a possible respiratory infection. The patient is at risk for atelectasis due to her large abdomen and prolonged bed rest.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is currently being managed for hypotension (not in shock), hypothermia, and hypoglycemia. The plan includes restarting her home medications, starting levofloxacin 750 mg orally daily, and continuing warfarin therapy while closely monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) due to antibiotic use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Infection: The presence of right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests a respiratory infection. This could progress to pneumonia if not appropriately treated.
2. Atelectasis: The patient's large abdomen and prolonged bed rest put her at risk for atelectasis, which can occur when secretions accumulate in the air"
