   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who is
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after
   thoracentesis.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Suspect re-expansion pulmonary edema
   DDX after thoracentesis in the setting of large volume transfusions is
   TRALI vs re-expansion pulmonary edema vs aspiration vs pneumothorax.
   Because the CXR shows a unilateral infiltrate, TRALI seems less likely
   and b/c the infiltrate is L-sided, aspiration seems less likely.  His
   leukocytosis has been stable (in setting of recent SBP) and he has not
   had any fevers also making a new pulmonary infection less compelling.
   Has lung collapse on imaging.
   - increase PEEP to 10 to facilitate reexpansion
   - diurese with goal -500cc  today
   - check 2pm ABG on new vent settings
   - continue to hold on antibiotics
   - hold on chest tube
   .
   # Pleural effusion
    Chemistries consistent with a transudative process, probably due to
   cirrhosis (eg hepatic hydrothorax) though more common on R side. Had an
   echo recently with nl EF so CHF unlikely cause.
   - follow up pending fluid cultures

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. He is intubated and sedated, with stable vital signs. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, which may have led to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He also has encephalopathy, grade I esophageal varices that were banded, and portal gastropathy. The patient's macrocytic anemia is likely due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding from gastropathy. He had acute renal failure, which has resolved. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient may be experiencing re-expansion pulmonary edema after thoracentesis. Other possibilities include TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury), aspiration, or pneumothorax. Increasing PEEP to 10 and diuresis with a goal of -500cc today are recommended to facilitate lung re-expansion.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion consistent with a transudative process, possibly due to cirrhosis (hepatic hydrothorax). This is more common on the right side. Follow-up pending fluid cultures is advised.
3. Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy: The patient has completed a course of CTX for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy per ARDS net protocol. There are concerns about possible re-expansion pulmonary edema and infection in the right lung. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, macrocytic anemia, acute renal failure, and encephalopathy. The patient's blood cultures and sputum culture are pending. The patient's family has been contacted regarding the possibility of a pneumothorax, and a CT chest is planned to clarify the diagnosis before considering chest tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern at this time is his hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be due to several factors including re-expansion pulmonary edema, infection, aspiration, or pneumothorax. Further diagnostic tests, such as a CT chest, are needed to determine the exact cause and guide appropriate treatment.

2. Re-expansion pulmonary edema: Given the presence of a completely opacified left lung on imaging, re-expansion pulmonary edema is a possibility. This condition can occur after the re-expansion of a collapsed lung, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress.

3. Infection: The patient's right lung shows increasing ground glass opacities"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of presumed EtOH cirrhosis, who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, macrocytic anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient is intubated and being treated according to the ARDS-net protocol. The initial assessment suggests that the cause of hypoxic respiratory failure may be re-expansion pulmonary edema or pneumothorax, and further evaluation is planned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The presence of a possible apical pneumothorax on the chest X-ray indicates a potential medical complication that needs to be addressed promptly. This could be confirmed with a CT chest scan before considering the placement of a chest tube.
2. Re-expansion Pulmonary Edema: The completely opacified left lung suggests the possibility of re-expansion pulmonary edema, which can occur after thoracentesis. This condition can impair oxygenation and ventilation, leading to respiratory distress.
3. Infection: The increasing ground glass opacities in the right lung raise concerns for an underlying infection. The sputum culture results are pending, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated if infection is suspected.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT/PTT/INR values indicate a coagulopathy, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. He has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, c/b SBP, c/b encephalopathy, and c/b portal gastropathy. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and his vital signs are stable. He has been weaned off oxygen to 50% and 5 cmH2O PEEP. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for unobtainable history due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern is hypoxic respiratory failure, which is suspected to be due to re-expansion pulmonary edema. Differential diagnoses include TRALI, aspiration, new pulmonary infection, pneumothorax, and re-expansion pulmonary edema. The unilateral infiltrate on CXR makes TRALI less likely, and the absence of fever and leukocytosis reduces the likelihood of a new infection. Aspiration seems less likely due to the left-sided infiltrate. Pneumothorax is also less likely since there are no signs of pleural rub or worsening respiratory distress.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion consistent with a transudative process, likely due to cirrhosis (hepatic hydrothorax). This is more common"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who is being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and has developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has a left-sided pleural effusion and dense atelectasis, which may be causing his low surfactant levels. The patient received 11 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to the procedure, predisposing him to acute pulmonary edema. He is currently tolerating pressure support (PS) well and would benefit from higher PEEP levels. The plan is to aim for negative fluid balance of 500 cc to - L through gentle diuresis. Repeat ABG or VBG will be done tonight, and further decisions will be made pending the results. Antibiotics will be held off for now as the patient appears stable. The patient has cirrhosis, for which he should receive twice-daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI), restart nadolol, and restart lasix. He is also being continued on ciprofloxacin for SBP. The patient has anemia but some acute hemoconcentration, with no clinical bleeding. His hematocrit (Hct) is expected to fall as hemoconcentration resolves, and it should be rechecked. The femoral line will be removed since he has a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Other issues are noted in the ICU team note.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old man with a history of EtOH cirrhosis being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and had a left-sided pleural effusion. He became acutely hypoxemic post procedure and received 11 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to the procedure. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The plateau pressure is 18 cmH2O, and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation is 100% on the ventilator.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, diminished breath sounds on the left side, warm and jaundiced skin, and he is sedated. His vital signs include a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.8°C.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 238 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 108 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, sodium"

   Assessment and Plan
   38-year-old man with
   >         Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
   o         Likely re-expansion pulmonary edema
   o         The confluence of intravascular volume loading and large
   quantities of plasma (10 units FFP) also predispose to acute pulmonary
   edema and may exacerbate re-expansion edema
   o         Aim for low-tidal volume ventilation.  Although technically
   does not meet criteria for ARDS, it seems reasonable to minimize tidal
   volume here.  He is currently tolerating about 7 cc/kg PBW (450 cc).
   Multiple vent maneuvers attempted to achieve compliance with 6 cc/kg
   but without further sedation unsuccessful.  We will aim to slowly
   decrease tidal volume to 6 cc/kg PBW tonight.  At this point (since BP
   in mid-90s), I think this is the best balance of risks and benefits (as
   opposed to deep sedation to permit 6cc/kg).
   o         Repeat ABG or VBG tonight and make further decisions pending
   results.
   o         No evidence of infection at this point.  Check ET aspirate
   for culture while off antibiotics other than cipro.
   o         Repeat upright CXR to further evaluate for PTX.
   > Cirrhosis
   o         Twice a day PPI
   o         Hold nadolol tonight; consider resuming in a.m.
   o         Hold diuretics tonight
   >      Coagulopathy
   o         Review records to ensure not nutritional
   >    Anemia (but some acute hemoconcentration)
   o         No clinical bleeding
   o         Expect Hct to fall as hemoconcetration resolves
   o         Recheck hct
   >          Access
   o         Fem line will need to be removed in next 24 hours
   o         The tempo of illness here is uncertain; since there is a
   reasonable chance of improvement by morning, we will leave in place for
   now.  If stable
 PICC in a.m.  Otherwise left IJ placement.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who is
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after
   thoracentesis.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Suspect re-expansion pulmonary edema. DDx including TRALI and pna, but
   think less likely.
   Lung aeration improved today on PSV 10/10, good oxygenation. Minimal
   secretions to suggest a developing pna, though he did develop a fever
   overnight.
   - Continue diuresis goal -500cc, lasix 40mg now
   - repeat ABG today
   - f/u CXR to evaluate reexpansion
   - sputum cx
   # Fever with GPR bacteremia
   Patient
s [**7-13**] blood cultures have grown GPRs prelim consistent with
   bacillus and clostridia. Possibly seeded blood from GI tract, other
   potential source includes emergently placed femoral line which is now
   discontinued.
   - Continuing vancomycin and Zosyn per ID recommendations, cipro ppx
   - Follow up pending urine and blood cultures, check stool C diff given
   recent antibiotics, CIS
   - Follow up final sensitivities and speciation for GPRs
   - possible para today to r/o recurrent SBP
   .
   # Pleural effusion
    Chemistries consistent with a transudative process, probably due to
   cirrhosis (eg hepatic hydrothorax) though more common on R side. Had an
   echo recently with nl EF so CHF unlikely cause.
   - follow up pending fluid cultures
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascitie c/b SBP, c/b encephalopathy, c/b
   portal gastropathy:
   MELD 24 today
   - will cont lactulose q4
   - cont rifaximin
   - cipro ppx s/p ceftriaxone for SBP
   - resume  nadolol, lasix , will hold spironolactone for now
   - cont Pentoxifylline
   - MRI as outpatient for HCC
   .
   # Macrocytic anemia: Has history of gastropathy. Hct had been drifting
   down, no gross bleeding now s/p 1 unit PRBCs overnight.
   - Continue PPI  [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily crits
   - T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   - discuss EGD with liver
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis.
- He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis.
- The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, fever, GPR bacteremia, pleural effusion, alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites and potential SBP, encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy.
- The patient has a history of macrocytic anemia and acute renal failure, which has since resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience difficulty with oxygenation and breathing.
2. Fever with GPR bacteremia: The patient may be at risk for further infection or sepsis due to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient may develop worsening respiratory symptoms or infection in the pleural space.
4. Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites and potential SBP: The patient is at risk for recurrent SBP and complications related to cirrhosis, such as hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension.
5. Macrocytic anemia: The patient may continue to have low red blood cell count and may require ongoing monitoring and treatment.
6. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's renal function has improved, there is a risk of recurrence or deterioration in kidney function.
7. Potential complications of critical care: The patient is at risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis.
- He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis.
- The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, fever, and positive blood cultures for GPR bacteremia.
- There are signs of re-expansion pulmonary edema, and the patient may have a pleural effusion.
- The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, which could be complicated by SBP and encephalopathy.
- He also has macrocytic anemia and acute renal failure, but the latter has resolved.
- The patient's family has been informed, and his care plan includes continuing diuresis, repeating ABG, and following up with CXR and cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to re-expansion pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of oxygenation and lung aeration is necessary.
2. Fever with GPR bacteremia: The patient has developed a fever and has positive blood cultures for GPR bacteremia. This indicates an infection, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued. Further evaluation of the source of infection is needed, as it may be related to the emergently placed femoral line or the gastrointestinal tract.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, likely secondary to his cirrhosis ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with hypoxia. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. There are no known drug allergies. The patient was started on vancomycin and Zosyn due to blood cultures being positive for GPR, consistent with Clostridium and Bacillus species. The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Vital signs include a heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/49 to 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 0 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O. The patient's abdomen is distended but soft with a positive fluid wave, and there is evidence of edema in the extremities. The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as low albumin and total protein. The patient's WBC count is within normal range, while platelet count is slightly low. Other lab results indicate possible electrolyte imbalances. The patient is diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, acute respiratory failure, and is receiving ICU care.

   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after
   thoracentesis.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Suspect re-expansion pulmonary edema. DDx including TRALI and pna, but
   think less likely.
   Lung aeration improved today on PSV 10/10, good oxygenation. Minimal
   secretions to suggest a developing pna, though he did develop a fever
   overnight.
   - Continue diuresis goal -500cc
   # Fever with GPR bacteremia
   Patient
s [**7-13**] blood cultures have grown GPRs prelim consistent with
   bacillus and clostridia. Possibly seeded blood from GI tract, other
   potential source includes emergently placed femoral line which is now
   discontinued.
   - Continuing vancomycin and Zosyn per ID recommendations, cipro ppx
   - Follow up pending urine and blood cultures, check stool C diff given
   recent antibiotics, CIS
   - Follow up final sensitivities and speciation for GPRs
   .
   # Pleural effusion
    Chemistries consistent with a transudative process, probably due to
   cirrhosis (eg hepatic hydrothorax) though more common on R side. Had an
   echo recently with nl EF so CHF unlikely cause.
   - follow up pending fluid cultures
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascitis c/b SBP, c/b encephalopathy, c/b
   portal gastropathy: (A) SBP: finished course of CTX (B) Encephalopathy:
   improved Varices (grade I esophageal varices s/p banding and portal
   gastropathy):
   - will cont lactulose q4
   - cont rifaximin
   - resume  nadolol, lasix , will hold spironolactone for now
   - cont Pentoxifylline
   - MRI as outpatient for HCC
   .
   # Macrocytic anemia: Has history of gastropathy. Hct had been drifting
   down, no gross bleeding now s/p 1 unit PRBCs overnight.
   - Continue PPI
   - Daily crits
   - T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - check hemolysis labs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including hypoxic respiratory failure, fever with GPR bacteremia, pleural effusion, alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, macrocytic anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, blood pressure of 106/49 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's urine and blood cultures have grown GPRs consistent with bacillus and clostridia, and he is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn as per ID recommendations. The patient's pleural effusion is likely due to cirrhosis, and he has a history of SBP, encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy. The patient's macrocytic anemia is likely related to his gastropathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. He is currently intubated and on CPAP/PSV with PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.6°F (Tmax), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 106/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals sclera icteric, PEARL, decreased breath sounds on the left, regular S1 S2 soft systolic apical murmur, distended abdomen with +fluid wave, +bowel sounds, 1+ edema in extremities, warm palpable pulses, and Foley draining dark yellow urine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is still experiencing hypoxia despite being on CPAP/PSV with PEEP. Re-expansion pulmonary edema, TRALI, and pneumonia are possible differential diagnoses.
2. Fever with GPR bacteremia: The patient has developed a fever overnight and blood cultures have grown GPRs consistent with bacillus and clostridium. There is a possibility of bloodstream infection that may have been seeded from the GI tract or the recently placed femoral line"

   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who is
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after

   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Suspect re-expansion pulmonary edema. DDx including TRALI and pna, but
   think less likely.
   Lung aeration improved today on PSV 10/10, good oxygenation. Minimal
   secretions to suggest a developing pna, though he did develop a fever
   overnight.

s [**7-13**] blood cultures have grown GPRs prelim consistent with
   bacillus and clostridia. Possibly seeded blood from GI tract, other
   potential source includes emergently placed femoral line which is now

   - Continuing vancomycin and Zosyn per ID recommendations, cipro ppx
   - Follow up pending urine and blood cultures, check stool C diff given
   recent antibiotics, CIS
   - Follow up final sensitivities and speciation for GPRs

   # Pleural effusion
    Chemistries consistent with a transudative process, probably due to
   cirrhosis (eg hepatic hydrothorax) though more common on R side. Had an
   echo recently with nl EF so CHF unlikely cause.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. The patient's main complaint is hypoxia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (Tmax: 38.7°C), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/49 to 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His ABG results show a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, HCO3- of 118 mEq/L, and PO2/FiO2 ratio of 236.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, fever with GPR bacteremia, pleural effusion, alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites and encephalopathy, macrocytic anemia, and acute renal failure. He is currently receiving multiple medications, including vancomycin and Zosyn for the GPR bacteremia, lactulose for encephalopathy, and lasix for fluid management. The patient's laboratory results indicate positive GPRs in blood cultures, elevated white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   38-year-old man with EtOH cirrhosis being treated for SBP and had a
   left sided pleural effusion [**7-13**] and became acutely hypoxemic post
   procedure (had received 11 U FFP prior to procedure)
   >         Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely re-expansion
   pulmonary edema and dense atelectasis with lungs that have been down
   for a period of time (low surfactant levels).   The confluence of
   intravascular volume loading and large quantities of plasma (10 units
   FFP) also predispose to acute pulmonary edema and may exacerbate
   re-expansion edema
   o         He is tolerating PS  well. I think he would benefit from
   higher PEEP levels (PS [**11-26**])
   o gentle diuresis today to aim for goal neg 500 cc to - L
   o         Repeat ABG or VBG tonight and make further decisions pending
   results.
   o        hold off on abx for now as he appears stable.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 38-year-old man with a history of EtOH cirrhosis being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and a left-sided pleural effusion. He experienced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure post procedure, which was likely due to re-expansion pulmonary edema and dense atelectasis. The patient has been receiving fluids and plasma transfusions, which may predispose him to acute pulmonary edema and exacerbate re-expansion edema.

The patient is currently tolerating pressure support (PS) well and would benefit from higher PEEP levels. The plan is to aim for a negative fluid balance of 500 cc to - L today. A repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) or venous blood gas (VBG) will be obtained tonight to make further decisions.

The patient's liver disease requires ongoing management, including twice-daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, restarting nadolol, and restarting lasix. He is also being continued on ciprofloxacin for SBP.

The patient has anemia but also exhibits acute hemoconcentration. There is no clinical bleeding, and the hematocrit (Hct) is expected to fall as hemoconcentration resolves. The Hct will be rechecked.

The femoral line will be removed, as the patient has a PICC line in place. Other issues are noted in the ICU team's note.

The patient's nutrition and glycemic control will be managed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and had a left-sided pleural effusion. The patient became acutely hypoxemic after a procedure and showed improvement in respiratory status but developed fevers. Blood cultures from the femoral central venous catheter (CVC) revealed clostridium and bacillus, which has been removed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), blood pressure ranging from 108/37-55 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is sedated but attentive and responds to verbal stimuli. His neurological assessment is limited due to sedation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin concentration at 7.4 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 238 K/uL, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated bilirubin levels. Blood cultures from the femoral CVC grew clostridium and bacillus. Other lab results are within normal limits.

   left sided pleural effusion [**7-13**] and became acutely hypoxemic post
   procedure (had received 11 U FFP prior to procedure) now improved from
   resp standpoint but with no fevers.

   >   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely re-expansion pulmonary
   edema and dense atelectasis with lungs that have been down for a period
   of time (low surfactant levels).   The confluence of intravascular
   volume loading and large quantities of plasma (10 units FFP) also
   predispose to acute pulmonary edema and may exacerbate re-expansion
   edema

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and a left-sided pleural effusion. The patient experienced acute hypoxemia post-procedure but has since improved. The patient currently presents with fever, and blood cultures from the femoral central venous catheter (CVC) show growth of clostridium and bacillus. The femoral CVC has been removed.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics. The plan includes repeating paracentesis and obtaining cultures from urine, c. difficile toxin, and sputum. The patient's respiratory status has improved with higher PEEP levels and gentle diuresis is being continued to aim for a negative fluid balance of 500cc.

The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 20.7 g/dL, indicating anemia. One unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has already been transfused. The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.6 K/uL and platelet count (Plt) of 238 K/uL. Liver function tests show elevated AST, ALT, and total bilirubin levels. Other lab results indicate normal electrolyte levels, kidney function, and coagulation profile.

The patient's chest X-ray was mislabeled as"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who is
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after
   thoracentesis.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Suspect re-expansion pulmonary edema. DDx including TRALI and pna, but
   think less likely.
   Lung aeration improved today on PSV 10/10, good oxygenation. Minimal
   secretions to suggest a developing pna, though he did develop a fever
   overnight.
   - Continue diuresis goal -500cc, lasix 40mg now
   - repeat ABG today
   - f/u CXR to evaluate reexpansion
   - sputum cx
   # Fever with GPR bacteremia
   Patient
s [**7-13**] blood cultures have grown GPRs prelim consistent with
   bacillus and clostridia. Possibly seeded blood from GI tract, other
   potential source includes emergently placed femoral line which is now
   discontinued.
   - Continuing vancomycin and Zosyn per ID recommendations, cipro ppx
   - Follow up pending urine and blood cultures, check stool C diff given
   recent antibiotics, CIS
   - Follow up final sensitivities and speciation for GPRs
   - possible para today to r/o recurrent SBP
   .
   # Pleural effusion
    Chemistries consistent with a transudative process, probably due to
   cirrhosis (eg hepatic hydrothorax) though more common on R side. Had an
   echo recently with nl EF so CHF unlikely cause.
   - follow up pending fluid cultures
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascitie c/b SBP, c/b encephalopathy, c/b
   portal gastropathy:
   MELD 24 today
   - will cont lactulose q4
   - cont rifaximin
   - cipro ppx s/p ceftriaxone for SBP
   - resume  nadolol, lasix , will hold spironolactone for now
   - cont Pentoxifylline
   - MRI as outpatient for HCC
   .
   # Macrocytic anemia: Has history of gastropathy. Hct had been drifting
   down, no gross bleeding now s/p 1 unit PRBCs overnight.
   - Continue PPI  [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily crits
   - T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   - discuss EGD with liver
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: resolved.

","The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 101/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. Physical examination reveals jaundice, scleral icterus, decreased breath sounds on the left, regular S1 S2 heart sounds, soft systolic apical murmur, distended abdomen with positive fluid wave, and 1+ extremity edema. 

The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, complicated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy. He has a MELD score of 24. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. He also has macrocytic anemia with a hematocrit of 23.4%. His renal function has resolved, but he has a history of acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who is
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after
   thoracentesis.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Suspect re-expansion pulmonary edema. DDx including TRALI and pna, but
   think less likely.
   Lung aeration improved today on PSV 10/10, good oxygenation. Minimal
   secretions to suggest a developing pna.
   - Continue diuresis goal -500cc, lasix 40mg now
   - repeat ABG today
   - f/u CXR to evaluate reexpansion
   - sputum cx
   # Fever with GPR bacteremia
   Patient
s [**7-13**] blood cultures have grown GPRs prelim consistent with
   bacillus and clostridia. Possibly seeded blood from GI tract, other
   potential source includes emergently placed femoral line which is now
   discontinued.
   - Continuing vancomycin and Zosyn per ID recommendations, cipro ppx
   - Follow up pending urine and blood cultures, check stool C diff given
   recent antibiotics, CIS
   - Follow up final sensitivities and speciation for GPRs
   - possible para today to r/o recurrent SBP
   .
   # Pleural effusion
    Chemistries consistent with a transudative process, probably due to
   cirrhosis (eg hepatic hydrothorax) though more common on R side. Had an
   echo recently with nl EF so CHF unlikely cause.
   - follow up pending fluid cultures

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. The patient's recent events include improved aeration of the left lung, removal of 60cc of straw-colored fluid with no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), performance of an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showing gastropathy and placement of a post-pyloric tube, discontinuation of ciprofloxacin, aspiration of bilious tracheal secretions post-EGD, and self-extubation overnight.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 07/15/15 at 09:15 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 07/16/15 at 06:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 78 bpm (68-84), blood pressure ranging from 101/56 mmHg to 116/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (8-16), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 76.9 kg and his height is 69 inches. His total fluid intake is 2,580 mL, with 190 mL going through the nasogastric tube, 259 mL through the feeding tube, 1,821 mL through intravenous fluids, and 350 mL of blood products. The total fluid output is 3,820 mL, including 330 mL of urine, 1,250 mL of stool, 60 mL of drain fluid, and a fluid balance of -1,240 mL.

The patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery, apnea ventilation mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 561 mL (513-608), peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratio of 228.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is sleepy and arouses to voice, with jaundiced sclera, decreased breath sounds on the left side, a regular S1-S2 soft systolic apical murmur, a distended abdomen with positive fluid wave and bowel sounds, and 1+ edema in the extremities. The patient's Foley catheter is draining dark yellow urine.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.3 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 238 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. He is currently stable post self-extubation and has improved aeration in the left lung. Diagnostic paracentesis with removal of 60cc of straw-colored fluid was performed, showing no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed gastropathy and placement of a postpyloric tube. He was previously on ciprofloxacin, which has been discontinued. Bilious tracheal secretions were aspirated post-EGD.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 07/15/20XX at 09:15 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 07/16/20XX at 06:00 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of presumed EtOH cirrhosis, who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. He is currently experiencing fever with suspected GPR bacteremia, a pleural effusion, alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites and potential complications such as SBP, encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy, macrocytic anemia, and acute renal failure that has resolved. The patient has self-extubated overnight and has improved aeration in the left lung. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, removing 60cc of straw-colored fluid without evidence of SBP. An EGD was also performed, showing gastropathy and placement of a post-pyloric tube. The patient has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), furosemide (Lasix), and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial reason for transfer to the MICU was hypoxic respiratory failure. While there has been improvement in lung aeration, ongoing monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Re-expansion pulmonary edema: The patient's improved lung aeration may suggest this condition, which can occur after thoracentesis. Close monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory status is important.
3. TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury) and"

   Assessment and Plan
   38yo with EtOH- associated cirrhosis, SBP and hypoxemic respiratory
   failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation following
   thoracentesis, thought secondary to rapid re-accumulation of hepatic
   hydrothorax, vs re-expansion pulmonary edema.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure
       - Etiology still unclear --> likely combination of re-accumulation
   of hepatic hydrothorax and re-expansion of pulmonary edema
       - Pleural fluid unremarkable for infection (had lots of rbcs, but
   no crit sent)
       - Patient self-extubated and has been breathing on FiO2= 50% ever
   since. Pt currently doing well. No signs of laryngeal
          edema.
   2. Plerual Effusion
        - c/w hepatic hydrothorax --> diurese
   2. Bacillus bacteremia
       - Currently on Vanc/Zosyn; will discuss with ID narrowing coverage
   to Unasyn.
       - F/u sensitivities
   3. Gastropathy
       - On PPI given gastropathy
   4. Varices
       - On nadolol
   5. Cirrhosis
        - Will start lasix and spironolactone for diuresis
        - Currently on Rifaximin and Lactulose for encephalopathy
        - Nadolol for variceal bleed prophy.
        - Has not been evaluated for transplant given patient recently
   intoxicated; hepatology following.  Has had other etiologies of
           cirrhosis ruled out.
   6. Relative thrombocytopenia
        - Unclear etiology --> ? portal hypertension vs drug side effect.
     Has not been on heparins. Clinical picture not c/w TTP-HUS.
           No evidence DIC on  peripheral smear.
          Will trend platelets.  If continues to drop will need further
   w/u
   7. Altered mental status
       - Likely c/w toxic metabolic.

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH-induced cirrhosis, initially admitted with altered mental status in the setting of SBP (Serratia). He underwent thoracentesis on 07/13 for presumed hepatic hydrothorax given dyspnea; however, this procedure complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of rapid reaccumulation of effusion versus re-expansion pulmonary edema, requiring intubation. 

During his ICU course, the patient developed Clostridium bacteremia (portal of entry = femoral triple lumen catheter). A diagnostic paracentesis was performed on 07/15, which showed a WBC count of 300 (6% pmns). The patient also had an unplanned extubation on 07/16, and all other interventions and medications have been documented. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 98/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His fluid balance shows a total input of 2,580 mL and total output of 3,820 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,240 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, plate"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH-induced cirrhosis. He was initially admitted with altered mental status in the setting of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and underwent thoracentesis for presumed hepatic hydrothorax. However, the procedure was complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure and rapid reaccumulation of effusion versus re-expansion pulmonary edema, requiring intubation.

The patient's ICU course has been complicated by several issues. These include Clostridium bacteremia (portal of entry = femoral triple lumen catheter), gastropathy without active bleeding but with grade-1 varices, and relative thrombocytopenia with unclear etiology.

In terms of interventions, the patient has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and received paracentesis, which showed a white blood cell count of 300 (6% pmns). The patient also underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) yesterday, which revealed gastropathy but no active bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 98/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool oxygen. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 561"

   Assessment and Plan
   38yo with EtOH- associated cirrhosis, SBP and hypoxemic respiratory
   failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation following
   thoracentesis, thought secondary to rapid re-accumulation of hepatic
   hydrothorax, vs re-expansion pulmonary edema.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure
       - Etiology still unclear --> likely combination of re-accumulation
   of hepatic hydrothorax and re-expansion of pulmonary edema
       - Pleural fluid unremarkable for infection (had lots of rbcs, but
   no crit sent)
       - Patient self-extubated and has been breathing on FiO2= 50% ever
   since. Pt currently doing well. No signs of laryngeal
          edema.
   2. Plerual Effusion
        - c/w hepatic hydrothorax --> diurese
   2. Bacillus bacteremia
       - Currently on Vanc/Zosyn; will discuss with ID narrowing coverage
   to Unasyn.
       - F/u sensitivities
   3. Gastropathy
       - On PPI given gastropathy
   4. Varices
       - On nadolol
   5. Cirrhosis
        - Will start lasix and spironolactone for diuresis
        - Currently on Rifaximin and Lactulose for encephalopathy
        - Nadolol for variceal bleed prophy.
        - Has not been evaluated for transplant given patient recently
   intoxicated; hepatology following.  Has had other etiologies of
           cirrhosis ruled out.
   6. Relative thrombocytopenia
        - Unclear etiology --> ? portal hypertension vs drug side
   effect.   Has not been on heparins. Clinical picture not c/w TTP-HUS.
           No evidence DIC on  peripheral smear.
          Will trend platelets.  If continues to drop will need further
   w/u
   7. Altered mental status
       - Likely c/w toxic metabolic.
       -improving. On Lactulose and Rifaximin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH-induced cirrhosis who was admitted with altered mental status in the setting of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient underwent thoracentesis for presumed hepatic hydrothorax and subsequently developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. In the ICU, the patient's course has been complicated by Clostridium bacteremia, likely due to a femoral triple lumen catheter.

The patient's 24-hour events include an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed gastropathy without active bleeding and three areas of grade-1 varices. The patient was also transfused one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) with an appropriate rise in hematocrit (Hct). Additionally, a paracentesis was performed, showing a white blood cell count of 300 with 6% polymorphonuclear cells.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 06:00 AM and Vancomycin at 07:58 AM. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including Furosemide (Lasix), Lansoprazole (Prevacid), and other ICU medications.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. He has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy. His current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, fever with gram-positive bacilli bacteremia, pleural effusion, macrocytic anemia, acute renal failure (resolved), and alcoholic cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern at the moment is his respiratory failure. The note indicates that he is stable post self-extubation and there is suspicion of re-expansion pulmonary edema. The patient's oxygen support should be weaned as tolerated, and he should be suctioned prn.

2. Fever with GPR bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures have grown gram-positive rods (GPRs) consistent with bacillus and clostridia. This suggests an infection, possibly due to seeding from the gastrointestinal tract or an emergently placed femoral line. The patient is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn per ID recommendations, and it is recommended to discuss with the ID team today. Follow-up final sensitivities and speciation for GPRs, as well as pending urine and blood cultures, should be done. A stool C. difficile test should"

","The patient is a 38-year-old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
- Heart rate: 96 bpm (normal range: 82-111 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 120/74 mmHg (normal range: 85-120/48-89 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (normal range: 13-20 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on nasal cannula

The patient has decreased breath sounds on the left side and a regular S1 S2 soft systolic apical murmur. There is also evidence of abdominal distention with a positive fluid wave and bowel sounds present. The patient has 1+ edema in the extremities, warm and palpable pulses, and a PICC line in place without any exudate or erythema.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. The blood cultures have grown Gram-positive rods (GPRs) consistent with bacillus and clostridia. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with presumed EtOH cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after thoracentesis. He was previously admitted for alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, fever with gram-positive rod (GPR) bacteremia, pleural effusion, alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, macrocytic anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time but appears sleepy. Physical examination reveals icteric sclera, decreased breath sounds on the left, regular S1 S2 soft systolic apical murmur, distended abdomen with positive fluid wave, palpable pulses, and 1+ edema in extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which requires ongoing oxygen support. The cause of the respiratory failure may be due to re-expansion pulmonary edema, TRALI, pneumonia, or other factors. Monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial.

2. GPR bacteremia: The patient has developed a fever with GPR bacteremia, possibly caused by Bacillus and Clostridium species. The source of infection might be the GI tract or an emergently placed femoral line, which has already been discontinued. The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics and will continue vancomycin while awaiting further culture results.

3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, likely due to cirrhosis (hepatic hydrothorax). The effusion is transudative in nature and does not appear to be caused by congestive heart failure. Monitoring the fluid levels and checking for any signs of infection is essential.

4. Alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, which can lead to complications such as SBP and encephalopathy. The patient is already receiving treatment for SBP and encephalopathy. Monitoring liver function and managing ascites is important to prevent further complications.

5. Macrocytic anemia:"

   Assessment and Plan
   38yo with presumed EtOH- induced cirrhosis, admit with encephalopathy
   and serratia SBP; transferred to MICU for hypoxemia following
   thoracentesis, likely due to re-expansion pulmonary edema.
   1. Hypoxemia
       - Likely due to re-expansion pulmonary edema and rapid accumulation
   of pleural effusion
       - Currently tolerating  2L NC; will wean to keep SpO2~93%
   2. Cirrhosis with portal HTN
        - Encephalopathy resolved.  Decrease lactulose given ~2L stool
   output.  continue Rifaximin
        - SBP prophylaxis with Ciprofloxacin
        - Nadolol 20mg daily for varices
        - PPI for portal gastropathy
        - Will change Lasix and spironolactone to 40 / 100, respectively.
   3. Bacillus bacteremia
        - Likely due to infected femoral line
        - Continue Vancomycin for 2 weeks course ([**7-14**]- [**7-28**])
   4. Thrombocytopenia
        - Platelets improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old individual with a history of ethanol-induced cirrhosis, presenting initially with encephalopathy. They were admitted to the ICU after undergoing a thoracentesis, which resulted in re-expansion pulmonary edema and subsequent intubation. The patient also had an episode of bacillus bacteremia thought to be related to a femoral line infection. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 110/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. They are tolerating a regular diet and have not experienced any major events overnight.

The patient is receiving several medications, including lansoprazole, lactulose, rifaximin, vancomycin, lasix, spironolactone, ciprofloxacin, and multivitamins. They are also on a weaning schedule for their ventilator support.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,279 mL and output of 4,160 mL, with a negative balance of 1,881 mL. They have received a total of 1,416 mL of intravenous fluids and have had 304 mL of tube feedings.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hematocrit of"
