","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, splenectomy, and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with bone metastasis who presented with hemoptysis. He was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is currently stable hemodynamically and from a respiratory standpoint. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a known history of cancer, which increases the risk of blood clots. The presence of bilateral PEs is a serious complication that can lead to respiratory distress and potential mortality if not properly managed.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's symptoms of hemoptysis could be secondary to lung cancer, erosive changes from chemotherapy, bilateral PEs, or post-obstructive pneumonia. It is important to monitor and manage this symptom to prevent further bleeding.
3. Post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia due to his lung cancer. This condition requires appropriate antibiotic coverage and respiratory support if necessary.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be due to PE, acute blood loss anemia, hypoxia, or anxiety. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates acute blood loss anemia, which could be related to hemoptysis or"

   of chemo [**2167-1-7**] who presents with hemoptysis, found to have bilateral
   PEs and post-obstructive pneumonia.
   .
   # Hemoptysis: s/p broncoscopy today during which RUL blood was seen and
   washed out.  Still requiring 6 L O2. . Heparin was started in the ED
   for PEs after discussion with IP and hematology with plan to continue
   gtt after discussion with IP. . The patient remains stable
   hemodynamically and from a respiratory standpoint. Of note, Avastin
   predisposes to significant bleeding. Guaiac negative in the ED.
   - continue heparin gtt with narrow PTT 60-80, hold in setting of
   respiratory compromise
   - active type and cross x 4 units
   - two large bore PIVs in place
   - monitor HCT q6 overnight

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, splenectomy, and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with bone metastases. He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy during which right upper lobe blood was seen and washed out. He is still requiring 6 liters of oxygen. Heparin was started for PEs after discussion with the intensivist and hematologist, with the plan to continue it after discussion with the intensivist. The patient remains stable hemodynamically and from a respiratory standpoint. 

The patient has a history of cancer and is receiving chemotherapy with Avastin, which predisposes to significant bleeding. His guaiac test in the emergency department was negative. 

The plan includes continuing heparin with narrow PTT of 60-80, holding in the setting of respiratory compromise. Active type and cross matching are to be done, with two large bore peripheral intravenous lines in place. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) will be monitored every six hours overnight, and length of enema (LENI) will be assessed for clot in transit. If the patient develops acute respiratory distress, the right side will be put down due to known right upper lobe mass lesion. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement is pending LEN"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with massive hemoptysis. The patient has been on heparin, but continues to experience hemoptysis despite this treatment. A bronchoscopy was performed to further evaluate the situation. The patient is also being treated for a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia. There is a history of lung cancer, and oncology will be involved in the patient's care. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and is receiving IV fluids. The patient has been started on antibiotics for hospital-acquired coverage. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Excessive bleeding: The patient's continued hemoptysis despite being on heparin indicates a risk of excessive bleeding. This could be due to the underlying lung cancer causing fragile blood vessels or the presence of a PE leading to further bleeding.

2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, especially since they are receiving antibiotic treatment. Hospital-acquired infections can occur if proper infection control measures are not followed.

3. Thrombosis: While the patient is on systemic anticoagulation to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), they are also at risk of developing thrombosis due to the presence of a PE.

4. Organ dysfunction: The patient's critical condition puts them at risk for organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic systems. Monitoring and supportive care will be crucial in"

s and
   post-obstructive PNA. Hemoptysis was initially relatively scant, but
   turned massive while on heparin prompting ICU admission. Unable to
   visualize fully by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, transferred to MICU-West
   for rigid bronchoscopy which he underwent earlier today. There was
   blood and blood clots throughout the lung; after evacuation, much of
   the airways looked normal with the exception of the RUL subsegmental
   trifurcation where there was tumor involvement and mucosal friability.
   Since stopping heparin, pt has not had recurrent hemoptysis and he is
   currently on 3 liters n.c. oxygen.
   Therapeutic options of embolization vs radiation discussed with IR and
   rad-onc. With concerns for further injury to lung parenchyma from
   embolization (esp. given known PE), it was decided to proceed with
   radiation. Given the slower onset of radiation to therapeutic effect,
   this raised the question of how to protect him from recurrent PE in the
   interim. IVC filter discussed, but utility questioned with recent
   LENI
s negative for DVT. Instead plan serial LENI
s to monitor.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of Hodgkin's disease, splenectomy, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with metastasis to the bone, and previous chemotherapy. The patient was admitted with hemoptysis, which initially was relatively scant but turned massive while on heparin. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy earlier today, revealing blood and blood clots throughout the lung, with tumor involvement and mucosal friability in the right upper lobe subsegmental trifurcation.

The patient has not had recurrent hemoptysis since stopping heparin and is currently on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The therapeutic options of embolization versus radiation therapy were discussed with interventional radiology (IR) and radiation oncology. Considering the concerns for further injury to the lung parenchyma from embolization, especially given the known pulmonary embolism (PE), it was decided to proceed with radiation therapy. However, due to the slower onset of radiation to therapeutic effect, there is a need to protect the patient from recurrent PE in the interim.

An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was discussed, but its utility is questioned since the recent lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Instead, the plan is to monitor the patient with serial LENIs.

The patient's current condition is critically ill"

   Please see MICU Green daily progress note for complete [**2167-1-23**] update.
   Briefly, this is a 46M with stage IV NSCLC, remote Hodgkin
s disease,
   initially presented for hemoptysis. Given finding of PE, pt was
   initiated on heparin gtt and hemoptysis worsened, requiring
   bronchoscopy and stopping of heparin gtt. Given malfunction of bronch
   equiptment in east MICU, pt transferred to west MICU green for bronch.
   Pt tolerated rigid bronch well in OR, revealed clot in RUL, washed out.
   After discussion with IR and Rad/Onc and MICU team, plan was determined
   to avoid embolization given concern for worsening infarction. He was
   transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for initation of radiation to the lung
   cancer in hopes of improving hemoptysis, as well as size of malignancy
   and release of post obstructive infection. Pt is currently off heparin,
   hemodynamically stable. Given negative LENIs, IVC filter has also been
   deferred.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a history of Hodgkin disease. He initially presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which revealed a clot in the right upper lobe, and it was decided to avoid embolization due to concerns about worsening infarction. Instead, the patient is being transferred back to the hospital ward for initiation of radiation therapy to the lung cancer in hopes of improving hemoptysis and reducing the size of the malignancy. The patient is currently off heparin and is hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's main concern is ongoing bleeding from the lung cancer. Radiation therapy may help reduce the bleeding, but there is still a risk of rebleeding. The plan includes airway protection and selective intubation if necessary, as well as positioning the patient on the right side to spare bleeding into the left lung.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is important to continue the current antibiotics and provide supportive care. Radiation therapy may also help relieve the obstruction caused by the malignancy.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient is currently stable without a heparin drip, there is still a risk of further clot formation. Daily lower extremity venous insufficiency"

   Please see MICU Green daily progress note for complete [**2167-1-23**] update.
   Briefly, this is a 46M with stage IV NSCLC, remote Hodgkin
s disease,
   initially presented for hemoptysis. Given finding of PE, pt was
   initiated on heparin gtt and hemoptysis worsened, requiring
   bronchoscopy and stopping of heparin gtt. Given malfunction of bronch
   equiptment in east MICU, pt transferred to west MICU green for bronch.
   Pt tolerated rigid bronch well in OR, revealed clot in RUL, washed out.
   After discussion with IR and Rad/Onc and MICU team, plan was determined
   to avoid embolization given concern for worsening infarction. He was
   transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for initation of radiation to the lung
   cancer in hopes of improving hemoptysis, as well as size of malignancy
   and release of post obstructive infection. Pt is currently off heparin,
   hemodynamically stable. Given negative LENIs, IVC filter has also been
   deferred. No hemoptysis since 1pm today. He is s/p one cycle of chest
   radiation to reduce tumor burden into the airway.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with worsening hemoptysis, on heparin for bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient has a history of lung cancer and is undergoing radiation therapy. The patient's symptoms include nausea, cough, and a moderate amount of hemoptysis this morning. His vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm and a blood pressure of 131/75 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on 3LNC and he is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds with scattered crackles, no murmurs or rubs, and no cyanosis or clubbing. The abdominal examination is unremarkable with soft, non-tender bowel sounds. The neurologic examination is also unremarkable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (23.0 K/uL), hemoglobin (10.0 g/dL), and platelet count (382 K/uL). The creatinine level is within normal range at 0.6 mg/dL. The blood cultures are pending.

The assessment and plan include the following:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of worsening hemoptysis. He was admitted to the ICU for close airway monitoring due to bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient has a history of lung cancer and is currently undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent radiation therapy at 04:41 PM on 01-23.
- He experienced nausea overnight and was given Zofran.
- The patient had some hemoptysis, which was treated with Zofran and cough suppressants.
- He had a moderate amount of hemoptysis in the morning, leading to desaturation to 92% on 3LNC. The patient was given more cough suppressant and increased to 5LNC. The radiation therapy and IR teams were informed.
- The patient's HCT remained stable overnight.

Medications:
- Levofloxacin was administered at 06:28 AM on 01-23.
- Ceftriaxone was given at 08:03 AM on 01-23.
- Vancomycin was administered at 08:22 PM on 01-23.
- Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) was administered at 04:14 AM on 01-24.
- Lorazepam (Ativan) was given at 09:00 PM on 01-23.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 36.9 C (98.4 F)
- Heart rate: 117 bpm
- Blood pressure: 131/75 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 92%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

Physical examination:
- General appearance: Thin, anxious
- Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, no edema
- Respiratory: Clear breath sounds with scattered crackles, no cyanosis or clubbing
- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
- Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, purposeful movement

Lab results:
- White blood cell count: 23.0 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
- Platelet count: 382
- Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 142 mg/dL
- Other labs: Normal electrolyte levels and liver function tests

Imaging:
- Lower extremity ultrasound on 01-22: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.

Assessment and plan:
- Hemoptysis: Most likely secondary to tumor eroding into the airway and exacerbated by avastin and recent IV heparin for PE. Desaturation this morning is concerning for bleed, but it is under control and has not opened up for the moment. Radiation oncology will perform radiation therapy today.
- Pneumonia, hospital-acquired (non-VAP): Continue Vanc/Zosyn. Radiation therapy to relieve obstruction.
- Pulmonary embolism (PE), acute: Tachycardic but minimally hypoxic. No heparin drip for now. Pneumoboots, daily LEANS.
- Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung: Oncology recommendations, once cycle of [Doctor Last Name]/Taxol and avastin holding for now.

Potential medical complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's hemoptysis has worsened, indicating a potential risk of severe bleeding. Airway protection is necessary, and tamponading the right bleed with selective intubation may be considered. Emergent embolectomy may be required if rebleeding occurs.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening respiratory symptoms.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has an acute PE, which poses a risk of further clot formation and potential complications like pulmonary hypertension or right heart strain.
4. Cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer may continue to progress, leading to further complications and deterioration in his overall condition."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of remote Hodgkin's and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with hemoptysis and found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also has post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) due to tumor involvement in the right upper lobe (RUL).

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and anticoagulants.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23.0 K/uL, thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 382 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's imaging shows a negative LENI (likely enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes) and evidence of malignancy in the lung. The assessment and plan include managing the patient's hemoptysis, post-obstructive PNA, acute PE, stage IV NSCLC, and providing ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

   pulmonary infarction in the context of PE, but remains an option if he
   re-develops massive hemoptysis and requires more immediate bleeding
   control . For PE, he remains off anticoagulation, receiving boots for
   DVT , obtain LENI
s.  For post-obstructive PNA: On vancomycin/zosyn
   plan  14 day course but will switch to augmentin for continued
   anaerobic coverage.
   Pt
s status has been unchanged over the weekend; one question is at
   what point would we feel comfortable resuming heparin. Will touch base
   with oncology, rad-onc services.  If we plan to do so soon, it would be
   preferable to monitor him in ICU given concerns for increasing bleeding
   rate. If the risk/benefit ratio does not favor resuming anticoagulation
   in the near future, may consider transferring to floor.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 33 minutes.

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted with hemoptysis. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes scattered expiratory wheezes, reduced breath sounds at bases, tachycardia, and no murmurs. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/82 mmHg to 145/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient has undergone several imaging tests, including a CTA which revealed bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli, right upper lobe likely post-obstructive pneumonia, multiple spiculated masses in the right lower lobe concerning for malignancy, and left lower lobe ground-glass opacities. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 23.0 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, normal glucose level of 106 mg/dL, and elevated platelet count of 382. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal range.

The patient's medical team has initiated various treatments, including continuing radiation therapy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has experienced several episodes of small amounts of hemoptysis and is set to undergo LENIs tomorrow. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 123/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving various medications, including codeine for cough suppression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with acute PE, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. The patient's symptoms, such as tachycardia and minimal hypoxia, are consistent with PE. Treatment includes anticoagulation therapy and consideration for an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter if necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, which may require continuation of antibiotics and chest X-ray follow-up. Additionally, radiation therapy (XRT) may be considered to relieve any airway obstruction caused by the tumor.
3. Hemoptysis: The patient's episodes of hemoptysis are concerning and can be attributed to the tumor eroding into the airways. The patient's bronchoscopy revealed obvious tumor involvement and friability of the airways. Immediate management involves airway protection and potential tamponading of the right bleed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with hemoptysis and has since been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's condition is complicated by tumor involvement in the right upper lobe (RUL) of the lung, which is causing airway friability and increasing the risk of bleeding.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which confirmed tumor involvement in the RUL. He received external beam radiation therapy (XRT) to relieve the obstruction. However, he continues to experience recurrent hemoptysis and increased oxygen requirements.

The patient's current plan includes continuing cough suppressants and antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia. He will continue with radiation therapy, and if he develops massive hemoptysis, intra-arterial embolization by interventional radiology (IR) may be reconsidered. Serial checks of hemoglobin (Hct) levels will be performed.

For the PE, the patient will undergo lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENIs) daily and pneumoboots will be applied. No heparin drip is currently initiated, but an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is not recommended as long as the LENIs are negative. Imaging of the pelvis for clots will also be considered.

The patient's cancer history includes remote Hodgkin's and recent treatment with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hemoptysis, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/82 to 145/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving various medications, including codeine for cough suppression. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Imaging studies reveal bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli, right upper lobe post-obstructive pneumonia, multiple spiculated masses in the right lower lobe concerning for malignancy, and ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe which may represent pneumonia, edema, or hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia increases the risk of complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with acute PE, which can lead to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, circulatory collapse, and potentially death if not promptly treated.
3. Malignancy: The presence of multiple spiculated masses in the right lower lobe concerning for malignancy indicates advanced stage cancer, which may contribute to further"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), admitted with hemoptysis. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia but is most likely originating from the right upper lobe due to tumor involvement. The patient's hemoptysis is secondary to the tumor eroding into the airway and exacerbated by avastin and recent intravenous heparin for PE. A bronchoscopy was performed, which showed tumor involvement of the right upper lobe and friability of the airways. The patient has undergone radiation therapy (XRT).

The patient's current plan includes continuing XRT, being aware of the potential for severe bleed during IR, cough suppression with Tesslon and codeine, maintaining good IV access, daily HCT checks, holding avastin and heparin for now.

The patient also has hospital-acquired pneumonia, for which antibiotics have been switched to Augmentin for anaerobic coverage, and XRT will be given to relieve obstruction.

Additionally, the patient has acute PE. The plan for this condition includes no heparin drip for now, pneumoboots, second LENIs (lower extremity nephropathy studies), encouraging ambulation, considering imaging of the pelvis for clots, and no IVC filter as long as LENIs are negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's stage IV and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the ICU for close airway monitoring due to worsening hemoptysis. The patient has bilateral pulmonary emboli and is currently on heparin. 

24-hour events include several episodes of hemoptysis, one episode being approximately 12 cups. His hematocrit (Hct) is stable at around 30%. The patient's antibiotics were changed from Zosyn/Vanc to augmentin for anaerobic coverage. LENIs were ordered but not done over the weekend. Heme/onc did not want to start heparin gtt soon due to ongoing hemoptysis. The patient was also hypertensive, possibly contributed by pain, and increased frequency of oxycodone was given, along with ativan.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were ceftriaxone on 01/23/2167 at 08:03 AM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 01/25/2167 at 04:28 AM, and vancomycin on 01/25/2167 at 08:45 AM.

Infusions include lorazepam (Ativan) on 01/26/2167 at 12:45 AM, and other medications are also listed. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data as of 01/26/2167 at 07:04 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 116 bpm (103-131), blood pressure of 116/89 mmHg (95-117/86-105), respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (12-27), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

Height is 67 inches, total input is 1,400 mL, output is 1,550 mL, with a negative balance of -150 mL. Urine output is 1,550 mL, and NG output is unknown. 

Respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device of nasal cannula with SpO2 at 95%. ABG results are pending. 

Physical examination reveals a thin, middle-aged man in NAD (no apparent distress). CV (cardiovascular) examination shows regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. PULM (pulmonary) examination shows clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. ABD (abdominal) examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. EXT (extremities) examination shows no edema.

Laboratory values include WBC of 19.3 (12.8"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and hemoptysis. He was admitted to the ICU for close airway monitoring due to bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient has been experiencing worsening hemoptysis, which is slightly increased from before. He is currently on heparin for the pulmonary emboli but is also experiencing episodes of hemoptysis. The patient's blood cultures are pending. He has completed XRT to relieve obstruction and improve hemoptysis but is still experiencing hemoptysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's main complaint is worsening hemoptysis, which can be caused by tumor involvement of the airway, recent IV heparin for PE, and avastin therapy.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia (non-VAP) and is being treated with augmentin for anorectic coverage for a total of 14 days.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has acute PE and is at risk for further clot formation. He is being encouraged to ambulate three times a day, and the possibility of imaging the pelvis for clots is being considered.
4. Cancer progression: The patient has a history of lung cancer, and there is a concern for tumor involvement in the right upper lobe leading to atelectasis and potential complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), admitted for worsening hemoptysis. The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli and post-obstructive pneumonia. He is currently experiencing hemoptysis, which is secondary to tumor involvement in the right upper lobe of the lung. The patient has undergone bronchoscopy, which revealed tumor involvement and friability of the airways. He has also received X-ray therapy (XRT) to relieve the obstruction and improve hemoptysis.

Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's worsening hemoptysis is a significant concern. It is secondary to the tumor eroding into the airway. The recent use of avastin and IV heparin for pulmonary embolism has exacerbated the bleeding. The patient's bronchoscopy showed tumor involvement in the right upper lobe and friability of the airways.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism. He is at risk of developing further clots due to his malignancy and immobilization. The decision to start anticoagulation is pending resolution of the hemoptysis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, likely due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay. The switch in antibiotics from Vanc/Zosyn to Augmentin is being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's stage IV and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), admitted with worsening hemoptysis. He has pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia but is most likely originating from the right upper lobe (RUL) due to tumor involvement. The hemoptysis is likely secondary to the tumor eroding into the airway and exacerbated by avastin and recent IV heparin for PE. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed tumor involvement of RUL and friability of airways. He also received radiation therapy (XRT).

The patient's current condition includes ineffective coping, hemoptysis, pneumonia (hospital-acquired, non-ventilator-associated pneumonia), and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung, and is currently undergoing treatment with chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe bleed: The patient has a history of cancer and recent interventions such as bronchoscopy and radiation therapy, which increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has acute PE, which can lead to respiratory distress, decreased oxygenation, and potentially life-threatening complications.

 HEMOPTYSIS:  [**Month (only) 11**] be multifactorial given diagnosed PEs,
   postobstructive PNA, and lung mass.  Most significantly the latter,
   getting managed with cough suppressants, oxygen, and XRT.  Active type
   and screen, adequate IV access. Continues augmentin as below.   Given
   significant hemoptysis will continue to monitor in the ICU.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 3154**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP), postobstructive
   component.  Antibiotics switched to augmentin.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE;  Still unable to use heparin.  Repeat
   LENIs reportedly show left DVT, will review final report.  Will need to
   proceed to filter.
 H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG:  NSCLCa with hemoptysis
   getting XRT, received today.  Cough suppressants seem to be helping.
   Need to clarify course of XRT.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), recently diagnosed lung mass, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hemoptysis. He is currently receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and experiencing ongoing hemoptysis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with fatigue, anemia, and pain in the right hip due to bone metastasis. He is on supplemental oxygen and has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE, which can lead to further respiratory complications such as hypoxemia, tachypnea, and even respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and potential complications like limb ischemia or pulmonary hypertension.
3. Hemoptysis: The patient's ongoing hemoptysis could worsen, leading to significant blood loss, hypotension, and shock.
4. Lung Mass and Cancer: The underlying lung mass, identified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), may progress and cause additional respiratory symptoms and complications.
5. Radiation Therapy (XRT): The patient is receiving radiation therapy, which carries its own risks such as radiation pneumonitis, fibrosis, and potential worsening of respiratory symptoms"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yo male with remote Hodgkin's, stg IV NSCLCa, admitted with
   hemoptysis - has PE and post-obstructive PNA but most likely
   originating from RUL due to tumor involvement
HYPOXIA:
   New this am. CXR with recurrence of RUL collapse but similar to CXR
   from several days prior and he was not hypoxic at that time.  No
   evidence of aspiration or PNA. Concern is for PE.  Poor candidate for
   anticoagulation given ongoing hemoptysis.  Other possibilities include
   infection, hypoventilation.
   - IVC filter to be placed today
   - OOB to chair after IVC filter
   - Wean as tolerated
HEMOPTYSIS: Likely secondary to tumor eroding into airway and
   exacerbated by avastin and recent IV heparin for PE. S/p bronchoscopy
   that was evident for tumor involvement of RUL and friability of
   airways.  S/p XRT.
   - Plan for chemo and XRT (see below); no XRT today
   - f/u rad once recs
   - IR aware for potential for severe bleed
   - Cont cough suppression w/ tesslon and codeine
   - T+C active, good IV access
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT today; transfuse for hct <24
   - Cont holding avastin and heparin
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 3154**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   - Switch Vanc/Zosyn -> Augmentin for aneorobic coverage for total of 14
   days: last day is [**2-3**]
 DVT: Presumably new LLE venous thrombosis secondary to underlying
   malignancy. Discussed with hem/onc who agrees with this plan.
   - IVC filter today
   - NPO
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE: tachycardic and now hypoxic.
   - No heparin drip for now, will hold off until hemoptysis resolves
   - Pneumoboots on RLE only (given new LLE DVT)
   - IVC filter per above
   - monitor vitals for now, no need for embolectomy
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG
   - Onc recs, s/p once cycle of [**Doctor Last Name **]/Taxol and avastin holding for now
   - Will likely restart [**Doctor Last Name 1793**]/taxol tomorrow per hem/onc, will continue
   to hold avastin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was admitted to the ICU with hemoptysis and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, and right upper lobe (RUL) collapse. The patient has ongoing hemoptysis and is a poor candidate for anticoagulation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already has an acute PE, which is a blockage in one or more arteries in the lungs. This can lead to severe shortness of breath, chest pain, and even death if not properly managed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is an infection acquired during his hospital stay. This can worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of further complications.

3. Hemoptysis: The patient continues to experience hemoptysis, which is coughing up blood. This can be a result of his lung cancer eroding into the airways or due to the use of certain medications like avastin. Severe bleeding may occur if not managed appropriately.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is suspected to have a new left lower extremity (LLE) venous thrombosis secondary to underlying malignancy. If left"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with hemoptysis and has since been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy, but avastin has been held due to ongoing hemoptysis. The patient's condition has been complicated by recurrent right upper lobe (RUL) collapse, hypoxia, and ineffective coping.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already has a diagnosis of acute PE. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of further clot formation and potentially life-threatening complications such as another PE or right heart strain.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient continues to experience hemoptysis, which can be exacerbated by the tumor involvement in the airways and the use of avastin. Continued bleeding can lead to respiratory distress and hypoxia.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
4. DVT: The patient has a presumed new left lower extremity (LLE) venous thrombosis secondary to underlying malignancy. If left untreated, it can lead to pulmonary embolism or other complications related to poor venous return.

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yo male with remote Hodgkin's, stg IV NSCLCa, admitted with
   hemoptysis - has PE and post-obstructive PNA but most likely
   originating from RUL due to tumor involvement
HYPOXIA
   New this am. CXR with recurrence of RUL collapse but similar to CXR
   from several days prior and he was not hypoxic at that time.  No
   evidence of aspiration or PNA. Concern is for PE.
HEMOPTYSIS: Likely secondary to tumor eroding into airway and
   exacerbated by avastin and recent IV heparin for PE. S/p bronchoscopy
   that was evident for tumor involvement of RUL and friability of
   airways.  S/p XRT.
   - no XRT today

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with hemoptysis, which is likely secondary to tumor involvement of the right upper lobe (RUL) and friability of the airways. The patient also has pneumonia, presumably hospital-acquired, and a new left lower extremity (LLE) venous thrombosis. He is currently hypoxic and tachycardic, indicating a possible acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's oncology recommendations include holding off on heparin until the hemoptysis resolves, placing an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and restarting chemotherapy with taxol and avastin once the hemoptysis resolves. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms of tachycardia and hypoxia suggest a possible acute PE. This is further supported by the presence of a new LLE venous thrombosis, which increases the risk of PE. If left untreated or not managed appropriately, PE can lead to respiratory failure, shock, and even death.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's ongoing hemoptysis, despite previous bronchoscopy and radiation therapy, indicates that the tumor may still be eroding into the airways. If the bleeding continues or worsens, it can lead to significant blood"

From the 24-hour events, it is noted that the patient had an episode of significant hemoptysis (46 cups) at 4 am and desatted to the point of being placed on 100% FiO2 face mask in low 90s. The ABG results showed pH 7.44, pCO2 45, pO2 93, HCO3 32, and Base Excess 5. Additionally, there was a recurrence of right upper lobe (RUL) collapse on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/74 to 144/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 90%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 2,595 mL of fluids, including 809 mL of IV fluids, 1,230 mL of PO fluids, and 1,125 mL of IVF fluids. The patient has also received a total of 1,650 mL of blood products.

The patient's respiratory support includes high flow nebulization and SpO2 of 90%. ABG results show pH 7.44, pCO2 45, pO2 92, and HCO3 32. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 98.

During the physical examination, the patient appears to be in no acute distress and has normal general appearance. The cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds and tachycardia. The respiratory examination notes crackles and wheezes throughout the chest. The abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. The extremities have no edema, and there is no cyanosis or clubbing. The skin is warm with no rash or jaundice. The neurologic examination is not assessed.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated leukocyte count of 335 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 131 mg/dL, sodium level of 0.8 mg/dL, potassium level of 28 mEq/L, chloride level of 3.8 mEq/L, total bilirubin level of 15 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 118 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. He has a history of malignancy, specifically lung cancer, and has undergone radiation therapy. The patient is currently in the ICU due to his critical condition. He is experiencing ongoing hemoptysis and has a history of pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia, low blood pressure, and desaturation. He requires respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, right lower extremity edema, and unable to stand. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's blood cultures, ultrasound, and radiology images are also documented. The patient's current medications include augmentin, anticoagulation, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and continues to exhibit symptoms such as hemoptysis and abnormal lung sounds (crackles). There is a risk of worsening respiratory status and potential need for more aggressive interventions like mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism and left calf DVT. There is a risk of further embolic events or deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and ongoing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Hodgkin's disease, and pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted with hemoptysis and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy. He has been experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. The patient also has a Foley catheter in place for urinary catheterization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The patient is experiencing blood in his urine, which can be caused by various factors such as urinary tract infection (UTI), trauma from the Foley catheter, or a thrombotic event. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction. This could be due to hypotension, contrast-induced nephropathy, or infection-related acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection, particularly post-obstructive pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be administered.
4. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, likely due to the PE. The IVC filter has been placed to prevent further embolism.
5. Hemoptysis: The patient's coughing up of blood is most"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU resident and was
   present during key portions of the services provided.  The assessment
   and plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would emphasize and
   add the following.  IVC filter placed yesterday.  No further hemopysis
   overnight.  Guaic positive dark stools. New onset hematuris.
   Comfortable lying in bed, denies pain.  Weak.  Lungs with occasional
   rhonchi Abdomen soft, normal bowel sounds  No palpable cords in lower
   extremities left leg swelling slight increased.
   WBC elevated, given hematuria have sent urine for UA, C & S.  Need to
   check with oncology to see if this will delay chemoRx initiation
   today.
   ARF post filter placement, may be secondary to prerenal and possible
   dye related.  Has received fluids overnight for tachycardia and low BP
   to rehydrate.  Also transfused one unit pRBCs.
   Family meeting with oncology service and MICU team at 6:30 pm today.
   Patient is critically ill
   Time spent:  30 minutes

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted with hemoptysis, which is likely secondary to tumor involvement in the right upper lobe (RUL) and exacerbated by avastin and recent IV heparin for PE. The patient also has post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), possibly due to the tumor obstructing the airway. He has been treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and is currently on Augmentin.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed tumor involvement in the RUL and friability of the airways. He has received radiation therapy (XRT) to the RUL. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, and he is experiencing dyspnea requiring high flow nasal cannula oxygen support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and anemia. His urine analysis shows gross hematuria with numerous red blood cells (RBCs), but no evidence of infection or renal impairment. The patient has an IVC filter in place due to his PE.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hematuria: The patient has gross hematuria, which could be due to urinary tract infection (UTI), trauma from the Foley catheter, or a thrombotic event. Considering"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yo male with remote Hodgkin's, stg IV NSCLCa, admitted with
   hemoptysis - has PE and post-obstructive PNA but most likely
   originating from RUL due to tumor involvement
 Hematuria
   Can be secondary to UTI, foley trauma, thrombotic event.  In regards to
   his DIC labs, FDPs elevated but has PE, and haptoglobin not low and t
   bili not elevated. Coags Ok. Also with creatinine bump. Perhaps would
   consider Renal source of blood as there are not clots. DDx would
   include thrombotic disease vs possible complication of IVC placement (?
   Potential for venous occlusion by clots)
   - continue flushing bladder

HYPOXIA:
   Likely [**1-6**] PE. Now with IVC filter. CXR slightly improved today and
   requiring less FiO2. No evidence of aspiration or PNA. Infection
   remains possibility.
   - IVC filter in place
   - OOB to chair
   - Wean as tolerated
HEMOPTYSIS: Likely secondary to tumor eroding into airway and
   exacerbated by avastin and recent IV heparin for PE. S/p bronchoscopy
   that was evident for tumor involvement of RUL and friability of
   airways.  S/p XRT.
   - Plan for chemo and XRT: no XRT today

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), admitted with hemoptysis, and diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia. He has undergone IVC filter placement and is receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, and has a Foley catheter in place. He has also had hematuria and received blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney injury. This could be due to hypotension (ATN), contrast-induced nephropathy, or infection (UTI).
2. Thrombotic disease: Given the patient's PE and elevated FDPs, there is a possibility of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or arterial thrombosis.
3. Complications of IVC filter placement: Although the IVC filter was placed due to PE, there is a risk of venous occlusion by clots.
4. Ineffective coping: The patient's leukocytosis and pneumonia may indicate an ineffective coping mechanism by the body.
5. Cancer progression: The patient's NSCLC may continue to progress, leading to further complications and deterioration.

Assessment and Plan:
- Continue flushing bladder to address hematuria concerns.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hemoptysis, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pulmonary embolism (PE), and hematuria. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions. These include the placement of an IVC filter, radiation therapy (XRT) with concurrent chemotherapy, and the insertion of a 3-way Foley catheter. The patient has also received IV fluids and blood transfusion.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and mild hypotension. The patient is experiencing dysuria and pain in the suprapubic region. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 100% with the use of a high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory status has improved since yesterday, with clear breath sounds and diminished wheezing. Physical examination reveals diminished pulses in both lower extremities, edema in the right lower extremity, and numbness over the right groin site of the procedure.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Other lab values indicate mild abnormalities in electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes. Imaging studies and microbiology reports are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hematuria, hemoptysis, hypoxemia, acute PE, lung cancer (NSCLC), pneumonia ("

   Imaging:
   CXR looks improved in RUL, maybe more perihilar vascular
   congestion/cephalization
   Microbiology:
   No new growth
   Assessment and Plan
   46 yo male with remote Hodgkin's, stg IV NSCLCa, admitted with
   hemoptysis - has PE and post-obstructive PNA but most likely
   originating from RUL due to tumor involvement
 Hematuria
   Etiology unclear. Concerned for DIC. FDPs elevated but has PE. Coags
   Ok. Also with creatinine bump. Perhaps would consider Renal source of
   blood as there are not clots. DDx would include thrombotic disease vs
   possible complication of IVC placement (? Potential for venous
   occlusion by clots)
   - continue flushing bladder
   - urology c/s: ? etiology and further w/u
   - try to find smaller 3-way for patient comfort
   - monitor creatinine
HYPOXIA:
   Likely [**1-6**] PE. Now with IVC filter. CXR a bit better today and
   requiring less FiO2. No evidence of aspiration or PNA. Concern is for
   PE.  possibilities include infection, hypoventilation.
   - IVC filter in place
   - OOB to chair
   - Wean as tolerated
HEMOPTYSIS: Likely secondary to tumor eroding into airway and
   exacerbated by avastin and recent IV heparin for PE. S/p bronchoscopy
   that was evident for tumor involvement of RUL and friability of
   airways.  S/p XRT.
   - Plan for chemo and XRT: no XRT today
   - f/u rad once recs
   - IR aware for potential for severe bleed
   - Cont cough suppression w/ tesslon and codeine
   - T+C active, good IV access
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT today; transfuse for hct <24
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 3154**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   - Switch Vanc/Zosyn -> Augmentin for aneorobic coverage for total of 14

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- He was admitted with hemoptysis and found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia.
- The patient's hematuria etiology is unclear, but there are concerns about disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed due to the PE.
- The patient has been receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy, including Taxol and avastin.
- He is experiencing hypoxia, likely due to a PE, and is being weaned off supplemental oxygen.
- The patient also has a history of pneumonia, which is hospital-acquired and non-ventilator-associated.
- The goals of care include scheduling a family meeting with the ICU team, hematologist/oncologist, and radiation oncologist.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The cause of hematuria is unclear, but possible causes include renal source of blood, thrombotic disease, or a complication of IVC placement.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is at risk for further episodes of hypoxia due to the underlying PE and potential complications such as infection or hypoventilation.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a hospital-acquired pneumonia, which needs to be"

   CXR AP [**2167-1-28**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
   partial right upper lobe atelectasis has decreased in extent. However,
   remaining signs of volume loss in the right upper lobe are still
   visible. The lung parenchyma in the right upper lobe is increased in
   density. Simultaneously, the mediastinal structures are widened,
   showing several abnormal contours and thereby suggesting hilar
   adenopathy. On the basis of these findings, a partially obstructive
   pneumonia must be suspected.
   Otherwise, no relevant changes are seen. The overall lung volumes have
   slightly decreased in the interval. The size of the cardiac silhouette
   is
   unchanged. There is no evidence of pleural effusions.

   unlikely given negative DIC labs.  In regards to his DIC labs, FDPs
   elevated but has PE, and haptoglobin not low and t bili not elevated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), admitted for hemoptysis. He has pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia but most likely originates from the right upper lobe (RUL) due to tumor involvement. The patient also has hematuria, which has resolved, and acute renal failure (ARF), which is resolving. He has leukocytosis, likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia and possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is also experiencing hypoxia, likely due to PE, and hemoptysis, secondary to tumor erosion into the airway and exacerbated by avastin and recent IV heparin for PE. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed tumor involvement of RUL and friability of airways. He received external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy (Taxol and avastin).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The patient initially presented with hematuria, which has since resolved. It is important to monitor for any recurrence of hematuria.
2. ARF: The patient had acute renal failure, which is now resolving. It is important to monitor renal function and continue with appropriate management.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia and possible UTI."

   Imaging: KUB [**2167-1-28**]:
   PFI: IVC filter at the level of the L2 vertebral body.
   CXR AP [**2167-1-28**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
   partial right upper lobe atelectasis has decreased in extent. However,
   remaining signs of volume loss in the right upper lobe are still
   visible. The lung parenchyma in the right upper lobe is increased in
   density. Simultaneously, the mediastinal structures are widened,
   showing several abnormal contours and thereby suggesting hilar
   adenopathy. On the basis of these findings, a partially obstructive
   pneumonia must be suspected.
   Otherwise, no relevant changes are seen. The overall lung volumes have
   slightly decreased in the interval. The size of the cardiac silhouette
   is
   unchanged. There is no evidence of pleural effusions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions that require attention. 

1. Hemoptysis: The patient is experiencing worsening hemoptysis, which is coughing up blood. This could be related to the underlying lung cancer or complications such as pulmonary embolism.

2. Bilateral pulmonary emboli: The patient was admitted for close airway monitoring due to bilateral pulmonary emboli. These are blood clots in the arteries of the lungs and can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and other respiratory issues.

3. Cancer (Malignant neoplasm), lung: The patient has a history of lung cancer, specifically Hodgkin's lymphoma. This could contribute to the hemoptysis and potential complications.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has suspected partially obstructive pneumonia based on imaging findings. This suggests an infection in the right upper lobe of the lung.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 94%, indicating low levels of oxygen in the blood. This may be due to the pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or underlying lung cancer.

6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been decreasing over time, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or other causes.

7. Kidney function: The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range, suggesting normal kidney function. However, there is protein"

 HEMOPTYSIS:  No hemoptysis.  Continues XRT.  Stable for transfer to
   the oncology floor as the hemoptysis was main issue for transfer to the
   ICU.
 HYPOXEMIA:  FiO2 weaned down to 3L.  Denies cough.  On antibiotics
   for postobstructive PNA.  WBC had bumped and is now trending down.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE/ LLE DVT:  Holding anticoagulation
   given hemoptysis in seeting of lung tumor.  His LLE is markedly more
   swollen this morning with known DVT which prompted placementof IVC
   filter.   Would hold on anticoagulation and follow clinically for
   now.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to dehydration/prerenal state.
   Improved with volume replacement.  BUN still increased albeit has other
   reasons for this (steroids, swallowing old blood).
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG
   NSCLCa with bone mets.  Pain adequately controlled.

   Hodgkins
   Had discussion with wife and reiterated what oncology had talked with
   her about regarding prognosis, on average 12 month survival albeit
   given his complications (hemoptysis) this may be less.  Also talked to
   her about the unpredictability of whether he will have further
   hemoptysis, may be at increased risk with necrosis in setting of
   chemoRx, also will be completing XRT.  Wife has signed HCP, waiting for
   family to witness so this will be on the chart.  We touched on the
   subject of DNR status and whether he would want intubation as we go
   forward.  Yesterday he was sleepy from premedication in setting of
   chemoRx and she did not want us to talk directly to him about this.
   Will approach again today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. He has a history of lung cancer with bone metastasis and is currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The patient experienced episodes of hemoptysis, resolved grossly with pRBCs and IVF boluses. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/68-102/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems reveals fatigue, occasional cough, no hemoptysis, anemia, and no pain. Physical examination shows clear breath sounds, trace lower extremity edema, warm skin, attentive and oriented neurologically, and no pain. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hemoptysis: No hemoptysis observed, continues with XRT, and stable for transfer to the oncology floor.
2. Hypoxemia: FiO2 weaned down to 3L, denies cough, on antibiotics for postobstructive PNA, and WBC trending down.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE), Acute/Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Holding anticoagulation given hemoptysis"
