","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of cardiac cirrhosis, mechanical heart valves, and chronic renal failure. She presents with acute-on-chronic renal failure and ascites. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Right-sided heart failure: Unclear etiology. Recent exacerbation with significant weight gain.
- The patient will undergo fluid removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

2. Renal failure: Acute-on-chronic renal failure with approximately 30-pound weight gain. FeUrea was 30%, UNa 15 both consistent with prerenal picture. Urine eos negative.
- The patient will need hemodialysis.
- CVVH will be started per renal recommendations as limited by hypotension.
- Follow-up renal recommendations.

3. Cirrhosis/ascites: Secondary to right heart failure.
- No signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- Consider therapeutic paracentesis, since not responsive to diuretic therapy.
- Nadolol was held to increase blood pressure.
- Follow-up liver recommendations.

4. Mechanical MV/TV/AV: INR supratherapeutic currently.
- Coumadin being held. Will restart in the morning.
- Argatroban while INR <3.0 (held for catheter placement, then restarted).

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of cardiac cirrhosis, mechanical heart valves, and chronic renal failure. She is currently experiencing acute renal failure and volume overload. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/52 mmHg to 75/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has crackles in the upper lung fields bilaterally, edematous abdomen, and absent pulses in both distal extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, low platelet count, and slightly abnormal electrolyte levels. Her INR is supratherapeutic, and she has been restarted on coumadin with a target INR of 2-3. She is also receiving argatroban for anticoagulation due to her mechanical heart valves.

The patient's current medical issues include acute on chronic renal failure, volume overload, mechanical ventilation, atrial fibrillation, right ventricular failure, cirrhosis with ascites, thrombocytopenia, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Her treatment plan includes continuing continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH), monitoring INR levels, restarting coumadin, holding nadolol due to hypotension"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of chronic renal failure, mechanical heart valves, cardiac cirrhosis, and atrial fibrillation. She presents with acute-on-chronic renal failure, ascites, and hypotension. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 90/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination reveals crackles at bilateral lung bases and edematous abdomen. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels, as well as a low white blood cell count. The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, penicillins, clarithromycin, heparin agents, and anaphylaxis. She is currently on several medications including argatroban, pantoprazole, colchicine, and epoetin alfa. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels indicate worsening renal function. This could lead to further fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of shock.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet"

   Agree with excellent MSIV note above.  Patient was seen, examined and
   discussed in interdisciplinary rounds.  Will start midodrine today for
   pressure support given aggressive diuresis with goal of transitioning
   to HD tomorrow.

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including congestive heart failure, mechanical valve replacement, liver cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently in the ICU for acute volume overload and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 90/52 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. Firstly, her acute on chronic renal failure may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly. Secondly, her liver cirrhosis can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome. Thirdly, her mechanical heart valves require lifelong anticoagulation, which increases the risk of bleeding. Fourthly, her history of gastrointestinal bleeding indicates a higher risk for future bleeding events.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent or minimize potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a complex medical history including cardiac cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, and multiple mechanical valves. The patient is currently in the ICU and presents with acute on chronic renal failure and ascites.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure in the 80s, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition.

The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, penicillins, Biaxin (Clarithromycin), and heparin agents. She is currently on several medications including Midodrine, Pantoprazole, Epoetin Alfa, Warfarin, Sevelamer Carbonate, and Miconazole Powder.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as low levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelets. Her liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include several diagnoses and corresponding treatments. These include right-sided heart failure with unclear etiology, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with acute prerenal on chronic renal failure, cirrhosis and ascites secondary to right heart failure, mechanical mechanical valves, atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, h/o GI"
