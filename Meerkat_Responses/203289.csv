   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
   metastatic to regional lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT
   presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, and progressive
   anemia.
   .
   # Hypoxia/Tachypnea: In this immunocompromised patient the differential
   diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known multifocal
   pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA last night and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic throughout the day
   of transfer.  Currently on 4 L NC with pO2 of 112 and O2 sats in high
   90's. [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to anemia.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   BIPAP. Patient is DNI
does not want to be intubated longterm. If
   intubated for currently respiratory distress, I
d be concerned about
   being able to extubate.
   - continue supplemental oxygen (currently 4L nc), nebs
   - daily CXRs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin (day 1 [**7-18**]),
   meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]), azithromycin (day 1 [**7-24**]), voriconazole (day 1
   [**7-22**]) for now as pt continues to be febrile with known pneumonia
   - appreciate ID recommendations
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy and biopsy as pt continues to be febrile
   and continues to not respond to current abx
   - consider thoracentesis for L sided pleural effusion
   - resend sputum culture
   - talk with heme-onc re: IVIG infusion and possible side effects of
   infusion
   - hold lasix
   .
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct today from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Concern for intraabdominal or retroperitoneal bleed.
   - q4 hour Hcts
   - 2 PIV
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - cannot guaiac as pt neutropenic
   - transfuse for Hct goal > 30
   - hemolysis labs: retic count 0.8, haptoglobin not decreased, LDH
   high/normal.  Will talk to heme about how to interpret this in the
   setting of CLL.
   - talk to heme-onc regarding oncologic therapy and anemia
   -obtain CT abdomen and pelvis today to look for intraabdominal bleed or
   retroperitoneal bleed.
   # Altered mental status: Over the past day since tachypnic and
   hypoxic.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to hypercarbic respiratory distress, anemia,
   new infection given neutropenic fever.
   -follow up ABG. Consider BIPAP if unable to ventilate on his own.
   -CT head to look for acute intracranial bleed
   -consider LP to look for infectious source, however given that he is
   already on broad specturm antibiotics, unlikely if this will have any
   value. Hold off on this for now. Will consider it if AMS persists.
   -no sedating medications.
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, voriconazole
   - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
   - ID input and onc input appreciated
   - monitor ANCs daily
   - f/u Cx data
   - follow fever curve
   - tylenol prn
   .
   # Transaminitis: Thought to be [**1-20**] antifungal so it was switched to
   voriconazole.
   - trend LFTs -resolving
   .
   # Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/CLL: Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 311**] most recent
   note, to consider 2nd dose of rituxan and vincristine.
   - Heme - Onc consult in AM
   - follow daily ANCs
   - continue GCSF per Heme-Onc
   .
   # FEN: no IVFs for now / electrolyte scales / NPO
   # Access: PICC, to place PIV
   # PPx: Thrombocytopenia, will use pneumoboots for now / IV PPI / bowel
   regimen
   # Contact: Wife (called on ICU transfer)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, and progressive anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's increasing hypoxia and tachypnea could be due to worsening multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or a large left-sided pleural effusion. This requires close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and arterial blood gases (ABGs). Consideration should be given to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) if the patient's condition worsens.

2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours without evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. There is concern for a pulmonary source or intraabdominal/retroperitoneal bleed. Frequent hemoglobin checks, transfusion for a hematocrit goal of >30, and evaluation for hemolysis should be considered. Imaging studies such as a CT abdomen and pelvis may be necessary to identify any intraabdominal bleed or retroperitoneal bleed.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has developed altered mental status, which could be secondary to hypercarbic respiratory distress, anemia, or a new infection given"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
   metastatic to regional lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT
   presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, and progressive
   anemia.
   .
   # Hypoxia/Tachypnea: In this immunocompromised patient the differential
   diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known multifocal
   pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA last night and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic throughout the day
   of transfer.  Currently on 4 L NC with pO2 of 112 and O2 sats in high
   90's.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   intubation
   - continue supplemental oxygen (currently 4L nc), nebs
   - daily CXRs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin, meropenem,
   azithromycin, voriconazole for now as pt continues to be febrile with
   known pneumonia
   - appreciate ID recommendations
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy and biopsy as pt continues to be febrile
   and continues to not respond to current abx
   - consider thoracentesis for L sided pleural effusion
   - resend sputum culture
   - talk with heme-onc re: IVIG infusion and possible side effects of
   infusion
   - IV lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct today from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to his oncologic therapy
   also.
   - q4 hour Hcts
   - 2 PIV
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - cannot guiaic as pt neutropenic
   - transfuse for Hct goal > 21
   - add on hemolysis labs
   - talk to heme-onc regarding oncologic therapy and anemia
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, voriconazole
   - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) currently receiving radiation therapy (XRT). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, and progressive anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the progress note include:

1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxia and tachypnea, which can be due to worsening multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or a large left-sided pleural effusion. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

2. Anemia: The patient has an acute drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 30% to 17% over 24 hours without evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. A pulmonary source is suspected, possibly related to oncologic therapy. Close monitoring of Hcts, transfusion for Hct goal > 21, and assessment for hemolysis are recommended.

3. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's differential diagnosis for febrile neutropenia includes known multifocal pneumonia not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, drug fever, or tumor burden. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, monitoring ANCs daily, following culture data, and seeking input from infectious disease and oncology teams are essential.

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
   metastatic to regional lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT
   presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, and progressive
   anemia.
   .
   # Hypoxia/Tachypnea: In this immunocompromised patient the differential
   diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known multifocal
   pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA last night and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic throughout the day
   of transfer.  Currently on 4 L NC with pO2 of 112 and O2 sats in high
   90's.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   intubation
   - continue supplemental oxygen (currently 4L nc), nebs
   - daily CXRs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin, meropenem,
   azithromycin, voriconazole for now as pt continues to be febrile with
   known pneumonia
   - appreciate ID recommendations
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy and biopsy as pt continues to be febrile
   and continues to not respond to current abx
   - consider thoracentesis for L sided pleural effusion
   - resend sputum culture
   - talk with heme-onc re: IVIG infusion and possible side effects of
   infusion
   - IV lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct today from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to his oncologic therapy
   also.
   - q4 hour Hcts
   - 2 PIV
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - cannot guiaic as pt neutropenic
   - transfuse for Hct goal > 21
   - add on hemolysis labs
   - talk to heme-onc regarding oncologic therapy and anemia
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, voriconazole
   - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
   - ID input and onc input appreciated
   - monitor ANCs daily
   - f/u Cx data
   - follow fever curve

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, and progressive anemia. His recent imaging shows a large left-sided pleural effusion, which may be contributing to his hypoxia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and several potential medical complications need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's increased need for supplemental oxygen and tachypnea may be due to worsening multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or a large left-sided pleural effusion. Further evaluation, including daily ABGs, CXRs, and consideration of intubation if the patient worsens, is necessary.

2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, but blood-tinged pinkish sputum suggests a possible pulmonary source. The cause of the anemia could be secondary to oncologic therapy. Monitoring Hcts every 4 hours, transfusing for a hematocrit goal of >21, and discussing with the heme-onc regarding oncologic therapy are recommended.

3. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient has febrile neutropenia, which can have various causes such as known"

   # Hypoxia/Tachypnea: In this immunocompromised patient the differential
   diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known multifocal
   pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2 requirement.  Also
   consider whether this is related to his IVIG infusion.  There was a
   question in the past that Rituxan may have caused hypoxia and
   tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now with acute
   hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with pinkish,
   blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low likelihood as
   not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears that there is a
   large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some hypoxia.  Pt

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) currently receiving radiation therapy. He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. The patient has a history of multifocal pneumonia and CLL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The differential diagnosis includes worsening of known multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and large left-sided pleural effusion. Supplemental oxygen, nebulizers, and daily chest X-rays are recommended. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and the patient's wife should be discussed about the possibility of thoracentesis to rule out empyema.

2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was found, but a pulmonary source is suspected due to blood-tinged pinkish sputum. A chest CT would have shown any abnormalities. Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed were ruled out with a CT torso. Most recent HCT this morning is 31.0 after receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Q4-hour Hcts, PIV, IV PPI, and transfusion for Hct goal > 30 are recommended. Hemolysis labs should be ordered, and"

   # Hypoxia/Tachypnea: In this immunocompromised patient the differential
   diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known multifocal
   pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2 requirement.  Also
   consider whether this is related to his IVIG infusion.  There was a
   question in the past that Rituxan may have caused hypoxia and
   tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now with acute
   hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with pinkish,
   blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low likelihood as
   not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears that there is a
   large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some hypoxia.  Pt
   was noted to be increasingly tachypnic throughout the day of transfer.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. The patient's medical history includes receiving external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient is experiencing increasing hypoxia and tachypnea. The differential diagnosis includes worsening multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and large left-sided pleural effusion. Further evaluation with daily chest X-rays and consideration of thoracentesis for the pleural effusion is recommended.

2. Anemia: The patient has an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, but blood-tinged pinkish sputum suggests a possible pulmonary source. Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed have been ruled out with CT torso. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is being closely monitored for ongoing blood loss or hemolysis.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors including hypercarbic respiratory distress, anemia, and new infection. Close monitoring of ABG values and consideration of brief intubation if unable to ventil"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and CLL, presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. The patient is currently receiving XRT and has a history of multifocal pneumonia. He has been experiencing shortness of breath and a strong productive cough with rust-tinged sputum. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The differential diagnosis includes worsening multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient's acute drop in hematocrit may contribute to decreased O2 carrying capacity. Supplemental oxygen, nebs, daily CXRs, broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, voriconazole, acyclovir), and consideration for bronchoscopy and biopsy are recommended. Thoracentesis for the left-sided pleural effusion is also suggested to rule out empyema.

2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in Hct from 30 to 17 over 24 hours without evidence of GI bleed. There is a concern for a pulmonary source due to blood-tinged pinkish sputum. Q4 hour Hcts, PIV, IV PPI, transfusion for Hct goal > 30, and hemolysis labs are advised. Hematologic consultation is recommended for interpretation"

   Assessment and Plan
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- somewhat improved today, but still somnulant
   compared to most recent transfer from MICU to medical [**Hospital1 **].  Possibly
   related to fever, infection (pneumonia) and/or medications.
   NEUTROPENIA -- recovering PMN.  Monitor ANC, currently >500.
    LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES -- monitor serial LFT.
   H/O CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE) -- demand
   ischemia.
   PNEUMONIA -- density RLL progressing, likely related to recovery of
   PMN.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- suspect in part bone marrow suppression.  No evidence bleed
   or hemolysis.  Monitor Hct s/p transfusion.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- poor PO intake. Would favor TF.
   DEPRESSION -- continue pharmacological treatment.
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Possible related to pneumonia.  Will consider
   Left thoracentesis to evaluate for complicated effusion of empyema.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been diagnosed with anemia, possibly due to bone marrow suppression.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, which is likely related to pneumonia. Antibiotics have been administered empirically.
- The patient's mental status has improved somewhat but still shows somnolence.
- The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has been recovering, indicating improvement in neutropenia.
- Liver function abnormalities have been noted, with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST).
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is at risk for ischemic heart disease.
- The patient has pneumonia with a density in the right lower lobe (RLL), which is progressing.
- The patient's nutritional intake has been poor orally, so total parenteral nutrition (TF) has been considered.
- The patient is also being treated for depression.
- FEVERS have been persistent and may be related to pneumonia. A left thoracentesis was performed to evaluate for complicated effusion or empyema.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and pneumonia suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.

2. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of ischemic heart disease, which can lead"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of anemia. They have been experiencing fever, poor tolerance for swallowing, mental status changes, weakness, fatigue, and despondency. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease, pneumonia, neutropenia, liver function abnormalities, and depression. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. They have received four units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fever and pneumonia, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
2. Bleeding: With a low platelet count and recent transfusion of PRBCs, there is a risk of bleeding complications.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating potential liver dysfunction.
4. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and may require ongoing psychiatric support.
5. Cardiac Ischemia: Given the patient's history of CAD and ischemic heart disease, there is a risk of demand ischemia due to increased oxygen demand during illness.
6. Malnutrition: Poor oral intake and inability to tolerate enteral feeds may result in malnutrition and poor nutritional status.
7. Respiratory Failure: The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and pneumonia increases the risk of respiratory failure.
8. Thrombosis: With"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of anemia. They have been admitted to the ICU and have experienced various health issues, including altered mental status, neutropenia, liver function abnormalities, coronary artery disease, pneumonia, and poor nutritional support. The patient has been receiving multiple medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and pneumonia indicate a potential infection. The density in the right lower lobe of the lung suggests an ongoing respiratory infection, which could lead to worsening pneumonia or the development of complications such as abscesses or empyema.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and low platelet count could increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent or identify any signs of bleeding.
3. Liver dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests indicate potential liver dysfunction. Continued monitoring is essential to assess liver function and manage any associated complications.
4. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic heart disease increases the risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction or ischemia.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor oral intake and reliance on tube feeds may result in nutritional deficiencies over time. Proper nutrition support should be maintained to prevent malnutrition and associated complications.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing may be necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Hypoxia/Tachypnea: In this immunocompromised patient the differential
   diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known multifocal
   pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2 requirement.  Also
   consider whether this is related to his IVIG infusion.  There was a
   question in the past that Rituxan may have caused hypoxia and
   tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now with acute
   hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with pinkish,
   blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low likelihood as
   not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears that there is a
   large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some hypoxia.  Pt
   was noted to be increasingly tachypnic throughout the day of transfer.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2 carrying
   capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural effusion.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   BIPAP. Patient is DNI
does not want to be intubated longterm. Wife is
   okay with intubation short term (approximately 2 days).
    - continue supplemental oxygen nebs
   - daily CXRs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin (day 1 [**7-18**]),
   meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]), voriconazole (day 1 [**7-22**]), acyclovir for now as
   pt continues to be febrile with known pneumonia. ID has recommended
   discontinuing Vanc, however given that this patient has neutropenic
   fever, will continue.
   - appreciate ID recommendations

   - talk with heme-onc re: IVIG infusion and possible side effects of
   infusion

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He is currently receiving external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's differential diagnosis for hypoxia and tachypnea includes worsening of known multifocal pneumonia, IVIG infusion, pulmonary hemorrhage, and large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent a thoracentesis for the pleural effusion.

2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours without evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Blood-tinged pinkish sputum suggests a possible pulmonary source. A CT torso ruled out intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal bleed. The most recent HCT this morning is 27.8 after transfusing 5 units.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has worsened since yesterday, which may be secondary to hypercarbic respiratory distress, anemia, and new infection given neutropenic fever. The patient's altered mental status improved once HCT was brought up to 30.

4. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient has febrile neutrop"

The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath and has required supplemental oxygen. A thoracentesis was performed for a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient's recent hemoglobin level dropped from 30 to 17 within 24 hours, with no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding but possible pulmonary source. His mental status has been altered since yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's increasing hypoxia and tachypnea could be secondary to worsening multifocal pneumonia, IVIG infusion, pulmonary hemorrhage, or a large left-sided pleural effusion. Monitoring ABGs, daily chest X-rays, and providing supplemental oxygen nebs are recommended. Consider non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BIPAP) if the patient worsens or tires.

2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours, possibly due to a pulmonary source of bleeding. It is important to rule out intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal bleeding with a CT torso. Transfusion for a hematocrit goal of >"

   Assessment and Plan
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- appears withdrawn, despondant and depressed.
   Currently refuses discussion with Pshychiatry.  Altered recall may be
   related to medications.
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Unclear source, although still with evidence for
   RLL pneumonia, now producing sputum with recovery of WBC.
   NEUTROPENIA -- marginal return.  Continue empircal antimicrobials while
   febrile.
   LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES -- elevation of Alk Phos --> concern for
   obstruction or biliary tree.  Monitor.
   H/O CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE -- stable.
   PNEUMONIA -- RLL, aspiration.  Continue
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- attempt to place feeding tube.
   ANEMIA, CHRONIC -- stable s/p transfusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. 

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen delivery. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.28, which suggests respiratory acidosis. The patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 31 breaths per minute, and they are producing yellow-colored sputum.

2. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, as indicated by a low hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL. They have received a blood transfusion in the past, which suggests that their anemia is being managed accordingly.

3. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers since admission, with a highest recorded temperature of 101.8°F on 08:00 AM [**2170-8-7**]. The source of the fever is unclear, but there is evidence of right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia. The patient is currently producing sputum with white blood cells (WBC), indicating an ongoing infection.

4. Neutropenia: The patient has marginal neutropenia, as indicated by a low neutrophil count of 0.8 K/uL. Neutropenia increases the risk of infection, and the patient is receiving empirical antimicrobials while febrile.

5. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver function tests show an elevation of alkaline phosph"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and anemia. They have been experiencing fevers, with a current temperature of 101.8°F. The patient underwent a thoracentesis procedure, where 260ml of fluid was drained. They also have a history of chronic anemia, which is currently being monitored. The patient's mental status is altered, with withdrawal and despondency. There are concerns about potential complications such as liver function abnormalities, pneumonia, and nutritional support. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia, and the symptoms persist despite antimicrobial treatment. There may be a need for adjustment in the antibiotic regimen or further investigation into the underlying cause of the infection.
2. Liver Function Abnormalities: The elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels raises concerns about potential obstruction or biliary tree involvement. Monitoring liver function is essential to identify any worsening abnormalities.
3. Neutropenia: The patient's marginal return of neutrophils indicates an ongoing risk of infection. Empirical antimicrobials should continue while the patient remains febrile.
4. Nutritional Support: The patient's poor oral intake and inability to place a flexible feeding tube necessitate alternative methods of nutritional support, such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or enteral nutrition if feasible.
5. Coronary Artery Disease:"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   BIPAP. Patient is DNI
does not want to be intubated longterm. Wife is
   okay with intubation short term (approximately 2 days).
    - continue supplemental oxygen nebs
   - daily CXRs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin (day 1 [**7-18**]),
   meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]), voriconazole (day 1 [**7-22**]), acyclovir([**7-25**])  for
   now as pt continues to be febrile with known pneumonia. ID has
   recommended discontinuing Vanc, however given that this patient has
   neutropenic fever, will continue.
   - appreciate ID recommendations
   - sputum cultures pending
   - hold lasix
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso
   yesterday. Received 5 units total.  Stabilized.
   -this AM's HCT 26.1
   -  Daily Hcts
    - PIV
   - cannot guaiac as pt neutropenic
    - transfuse for Hct goal around 27
    - hemolysis labs: no evidence of hemolysis
   - f/u heme-onc recs
   #Psychiatry: Patient is markedly depressed, however has declined
   psychiatry consult.
   - Continue celexa 20mg qd.
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   -send C. diff cultures if patient has diarrhea
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, voriconazole, acyclovir
    - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
   - ID input and onc input appreciated
   - monitor ANCs daily
    - follow fever curve - tylenol prn
   # Transaminitis: Most likely secondary to voriconazole or acyclovir.
   -will touch base with ID regarding discontinuing these meds, as pna is
   most likely bacterial.
   -          trend LFTs
progressively worse
   -          Alk phos rising. However no abdominal pain.
   # Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/CLL: Day 6 since

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He is currently receiving external radiation therapy (XRT) and presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which could be worsening or related to IVIG infusion. Other possibilities include pulmonary hemorrhage or a large left-sided pleural effusion causing hypoxia. The patient underwent thoracentesis for the pleural effusion.
2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours without evidence of GI bleed. There is suspicion of a pulmonary source due to blood-tinged pinkish sputum. A CT torso ruled out intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed. The patient received 5 units of blood and stabilized.
3. Febrile Neutropenia: The differential diagnosis includes known multifocal pneumonia not responding to antibiotics, drug fever, or tumor burden. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, voriconazole, acyclovir) are being continued, and the patient's ANCs are being monitored daily.
4. Transaminitis: Rising liver function tests are likely secondary to voriconazole or acyclovir"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   BIPAP. Patient is DNI
does not want to be intubated longterm. Wife is
   okay with intubation short term (approximately 2 days).
    - continue supplemental oxygen nebs
   - daily CXRs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin (day 1 [**7-18**]),
   meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]), voriconazole (day 1 [**7-22**]), acyclovir([**7-25**])  for
   now as pt continues to be febrile with known pneumonia. ID has
   recommended discontinuing Vanc, however given that this patient has
   neutropenic fever, will continue.
   - appreciate ID recommendations
   - sputum cultures pending
   - hold lasix
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso
   yesterday. Received 5 units total.  Stabilized.
   -this AM's HCT 26.1

   - cannot guaiac as pt neutropenic
    - transfuse for Hct goal around 27
    - hemolysis labs: no evidence of hemolysis
   - f/u heme-onc recs
   #Psychiatry: Patient is markedly depressed, however has declined
   psychiatry consult.  Currently on celexa 20mg qd.
   -Will curbside psychiatry to find out if they recommend a better
   regimen
   # Altered mental status: [**8-5**] tachypnic and hypoxic.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary
   to hypercarbic respiratory distress, anemia, new infection given
   neutropenic fever.
     -resolved once HCT brought up to 30. Most likely secondary to anemia.
   -follow up ABG. Consider BIPAP and brief intubation if unable to
   ventilate on his own.
    -CT head negative for acute bleed
   -no sedating medications.
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, voriconazole, acyclovir
    - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
   - ID input and onc input appreciated
   - monitor ANCs daily
    - follow fever curve - tylenol prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. He has been diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia and a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to anemia, hypercarbic respiratory distress, and a new infection. He has received broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. His blood cultures are pending, and he is currently being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, voriconazole, and acyclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of severe and widespread lung infection. This can lead to respiratory failure and septic shock if not effectively managed.

2. Pleural effusion: The large left-sided pleural effusion may cause hypoxia and further compromise the patient's respiratory status. Thoracentesis has been performed, but it is important to monitor for reaccumulation and consider repeat procedures if necessary.

3. Anemia: The acute drop in hematocrit indicates significant blood loss or hemolysis. The patient's anemia contributes to his altered mental status and decreased oxygen carrying capacity. It is crucial to identify the underlying cause and provide appropriate"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and hypoxemia. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's medical history includes chronic leukemia (CLL), coronary artery disease (CAD), pneumonia in the right lower lobe (RLL), and chronic anemia. They also have altered mental status, febrile neutropenia, and liver function test abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's slow clinical response to antimicrobials and the presence of hypoxemia suggest that they may have pneumonia. If not properly managed, the infection could worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially sepsis.

2. Chronic Leukemia (CLL): The patient's chronic leukemia requires ongoing management with chemotherapy. If not appropriately treated, the leukemia may progress, leading to complications such as bone marrow suppression, increased risk of infections, and bleeding disorders.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Although the patient's CAD is currently stable, it remains a concern due to the increased risk of cardiac events associated with critical illness and the stress on the cardiovascular system. Monitoring for signs of ischemia or myocardial infarction is crucial.

4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia needs to be managed through transfusions to maintain a target hematocrit level. Inadequate treatment may result in continued fatigue, reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   BIPAP. Patient is DNI
does not want to be intubated longterm. Wife is
   okay with intubation short term (approximately 2 days).
    - continue supplemental oxygen nebs
   - daily CXRs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin (day 1 [**7-18**]),
   meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]), voriconazole (day 1 [**7-22**]), acyclovir([**7-25**])  for
   now as pt continues to be febrile with known pneumonia. ID has
   recommended discontinuing Vanc. Oncology is comfortably with d/c-ing
   Vanc and Voriconazole.  Would like him to stay on acyclovir.
    - appreciate ID recommendations
   - sputum cultures NGTD
   - hold lasix
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso
   yesterday. Received 5 units total.  Stabilized.
   -this AM's HCT stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. The patient has been receiving XRT (radiation therapy) and is currently in the ICU. He has a known multifocal pneumonia that is not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other possible diagnoses include drug fever, tumor burden, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypoxia, and tachypnea may indicate worsening of his known multifocal pneumonia. It is important to consider this as a potential complication and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Drug-related complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, meropenem, voriconazole, and acyclovir. These medications may have side effects such as drug fever, transaminitis, or pulmonary complications. Monitoring the patient's response to these medications and checking for any adverse effects is crucial.
3. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient's acute drop in hematocrit and pinkish, blood-tinged sputum raise concerns for pulmonary hemorrhage. Although not confirmed by imaging, it should be considered as a potential complication.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   BIPAP. Patient is DNI
does not want to be intubated longterm. Wife is
   okay with intubation short term (approximately 2 days).
    - continue supplemental oxygen nebs
   - daily CXRs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin (day 1 [**7-18**]),
   meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]), voriconazole (day 1 [**7-22**]), acyclovir([**7-25**])  for
   now as pt continues to be febrile with known pneumonia. ID has
   recommended discontinuing Vanc, however given that this patient has
   neutropenic fever, will continue.
    - appreciate ID recommendations
   - sputum cultures pending
   - hold lasix
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. The patient has a history of receiving external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of severe and progressive lung infection. This can lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The presence of pinkish, blood-tinged sputum raises concern for possible pulmonary bleeding, especially given the patient's recent drop in hematocrit without evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Pleural effusion: The large left-sided pleural effusion observed on CT scan may contribute to hypoxia and respiratory distress. Thoracentesis has already been performed to address this issue.

4. Anemia: The acute drop in hematocrit suggests significant blood loss, which could be due to pulmonary or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

5. Febrile neutropenia: The patient's fever and neutropenia pose a high risk for bacterial or fungal infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but close monitoring and appropriate"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including hypoxemia, altered mental status, neutropenia, liver function abnormalities, a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), pneumonia in the right lower lung field, leukemia (chronic lymphocytic leukemia - CLL), anemia, and elevated bicarbonate levels. The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, such as nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia and pneumonia indicate a risk of respiratory failure, which could worsen due to their critically ill condition.
2. Infection: The presence of pneumonia suggests that the patient is susceptible to further infections, which can complicate their clinical course.
3. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and low platelet count increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Organ Dysfunction: Liver function abnormalities and anemia may indicate underlying organ dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by the patient's critical illness.
5. Cardiovascular Events: The patient's history of CAD puts them at risk for cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
6. Leukemia Complications: CLL can lead to complications such as immunosup"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. These potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in their blood. This could be due to pneumonia or other respiratory issues.

2. Depressive symptoms: The patient remains despondent and fatigued. It is suspected that the patient may have depression (reactive) and is already on antidepressants.

3. Neutropenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, specifically neutrophils, which could be caused by recent chemotherapy. Monitoring of daily counts is necessary.

4. Liver function abnormalities: There are evolving liver function abnormalities, which may be related to medication effects. If the abnormalities continue to rise, a repeat abdominal ultrasound might be considered.

5. Coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease: The patient has a history of CAD and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Monitoring for symptoms is recommended.

6. Pneumonia, right lower lobe (RLL): The patient has persistent pneumonia in the RLL, especially considering the patient is neutropenic again. Empirical antimicrobials should be continued.

7. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): The patient has a history of CLL and has undergone chemotherapy.

8. Anemia: The patient is likely anemic secondary to chemotherapy. A transfusion goal of >21 is recommended.

   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   BIPAP. Patient is DNI
does not want to be intubated longterm. Wife is
   okay with intubation short term (approximately 2 days).
    - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
   - daily CXRs
   Vancomycin discontinued as patient hasn't grown MRSA, and has completed
   24 day course.  Voriconazole was discontinued after 20 day course as
   patient had rising LFTs.
   - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]),
   acyclovir([**7-25**])  for now as pt continues to be febrile with known
   pneumonia.
    - appreciate ID recommendations
   - sputum cultures NGTD
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso

   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   -send C. diff cultures if patient has diarrhea
   - continue meropenem, acyclovir.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He is currently receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.

The patient's condition is complex and requires further evaluation. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient has known multifocal pneumonia, and the differential diagnosis includes worsening of his known pneumonia. Other possibilities to consider are related to IVIG infusion, pulmonary hemorrhage, or a large left-sided pleural effusion causing hypoxia. The patient has already undergone a thoracentesis for the pleural effusion.

2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. There is no evidence of GI bleed, but a pulmonary source is suspected due to blood-tinged pinkish sputum. A CT torso has ruled out intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed.

3. Psychiatric issues: The patient is markedly depressed but has declined a psychiatry consult. He is currently on citalopram (Celexa) 20mg qd.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He is currently receiving external beam radiation therapy (XRT). The patient presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. He has a past medical history of multilobar pneumonia, and there is a concern for worsening of his known multifocal pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. A large left-sided pleural effusion was also noted on CT, which may be contributing to his hypoxia. The patient underwent thoracentesis for the pleural effusion.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient's immunocompromised status makes the differential diagnosis broad, including worsening of known multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or drug-related reactions. It is important to consider whether the fever is related to IVIG infusion or Rituxan therapy. Pulmonary hemorrhage should be considered due to the patient's acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding, along with pinkish, blood-tinged sputum. Lastly, the large left-sided pleural effusion seen on CT may be causing some hypoxia.

2. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. There is no evidence of GI bleed, but a pulmonary source is suspected"

   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic

   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2

   effusion.
   - follow ABGs; should patient acutely worsen or tires, would consider
   BIPAP. Patient is DNI

   okay with intubation short term (approximately 2 days).
    - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
   - daily CXRs
   Vancomycin discontinued as patient hasn't grown MRSA, and has completed
   24 day course.  Voriconazole was discontinued after 20 day course as
   patient had rising LFTs.
   - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]),
   acyclovir([**7-25**])  for now as pt continues to be febrile with known
   pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), currently receiving radiation therapy (XRT). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. The patient's recent chest CT scan showed a large left-sided pleural effusion, which may be causing some hypoxia. The patient underwent thoracentesis on [8-7] for the pleural effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient has a known multifocal pneumonia that is not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics. This could be worsening and contributing to the fever, hypoxia, and tachypnea.
2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient has a recent history of pinkish, blood-tinged sputum, which raises concern for pulmonary hemorrhage, although the CT scan did not show diffuse findings.
3. Pleural effusion: The large left-sided pleural effusion seen on CT scan may be causing hypoxia. Thoracentesis was performed to remove fluid from the pleural space.
4. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30 to 17 over 24 hours without evidence of GI bleeding. There is a concern for a pulmonary source of bleeding, but this has not been confirmed.

   #Hyponatremia: Patient appears euvolemic, but could be slightly dry.
   Has been getting free water with his tube feeds for the past 3 days and
   was normonatremic before this started.  Free water could be the cause.
   SIADH is also a concern given cancer.
   -send urine osm, unine lytes and serum osm.
   -decrease amount of free water with tube feeds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) currently receiving external beam radiation therapy (XRT). The patient presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient has been experiencing worsening of his known multifocal pneumonia, evidenced by recent computed tomography angiography (CTA) and increased oxygen requirement. This may be due to worsening infection or an adverse reaction to IVIG infusion.

2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient has a recent history of pinkish, blood-tinged sputum, which could indicate pulmonary bleeding. However, there are no diffuse findings on CTA to suggest this.

3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion causing some hypoxia, as observed on CT. Thoracentesis was performed on [**8-7**].

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which may be caused by free water administration with tube feeds or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) related to cancer.

5. Back peeling: The patient has back peeling, most likely secondary to prolonged pressure on the back."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
   - daily CXRs
   Vancomycin discontinued as patient hasn't grown MRSA, and has completed
   24 day course.  Voriconazole was discontinued after 20 day course as
   patient had rising LFTs.
   - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]),
   acyclovir([**7-25**])  for now as pt continues to be febrile with known
   pneumonia.
    - sputum cultures NGTD
   # Back pealing: Most likely secondary to prolonged pressure on back.
   Encourage sitting up and rotation as much as possible.  Currently sits
   up 4 hours per day.
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
   Vancomycin discontinued as patient hasn't grown MRSA, and has completed
   24 day course.  Voriconazole was discontinued after 20 day course as
   patient had rising LFTs.
   - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]),
   acyclovir([**7-25**])  for now as pt continues to be febrile with known
   pneumonia. Caspofungin started [**8-11**].
    - sputum cultures NGTD
   #Hyponatremia: Patient appears euvolemic, but could be slightly dry.
   Has been getting free water with his tube feeds for the past 3 days and
   was normonatremic before this started.  Free water could be the cause.
   SIADH is also a concern given cancer.
    -resolved
   # Back peeling: Most likely secondary to prolonged pressure on back.
   Encourage sitting up and rotation as much as possible.  Currently sits
   up 4 hours per day.
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso.
   Received 5 units total.  Stabilized.
    - HCT stable
slowly trending down, today 23.2. His pulmonary status
   improved with blood earlier in the week, so transfused 1 unit after
   IVIG on [**8-12**]
   -  Daily Hcts
   #Psychiatry: Patient is markedly depressed, however has declined
   psychiatry consult.
   - Continue liquid Prozac qd.
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   -f/u C. diff cultures
   - continue meropenem, acyclovir, caspofungin.
    - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
   - ID input and onc input appreciated
   - monitor ANCs daily
    - follow fever curve - tylenol prn
   # Transaminitis: Most likely secondary to voriconazole or acyclovir. ID
   has recommended checking EBV and CMV PCRs. Not attributed to
   antibiotics. Discontinued Vanc and Voriconazole on [**8-10**].  LFTs slightly
   lower today.
   -concern for invasive fungal infection.  Caspofungin started [**8-11**].
   Since patient
s LFTs are trending down, will hold off on imaging.
   Consider liver imaging if LFTs begin to rise again.
   -          trend LFTs
   -         No abdominal pain currently.
   # Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/CLL: Last dose of
   Vincristine/Rituxan ([**8-4**]); IVIG ([**8-5**], [**8-13**]). Tolerated IVIG well.
   -continue Neupogen
   - ANCs decreasing
Onc has no new recs regarding this. No plan for
   chemo right now.
   - continue GCSF per Heme-Onc
   # FEN: no IVFs for now / electrolyte scales / Neutropenic diet. Started
   TFs on [**8-8**]. Hyponatremia thought to be secondary to TFs, thus TFs have
   been slowed down to 30cc/hr.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), currently receiving external beam radiation therapy (XRT). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. The patient has been diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia, and his differential diagnosis includes worsening of known multifocal pneumonia, possible pulmonary hemorrhage, and large left-sided pleural effusion causing hypoxia. The patient has also been experiencing hyponatremia, back peeling, anemia, and depression. He has been receiving various treatments including IVIG, blood transfusions, antibiotics (meropenem, acyclovir), caspofungin, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient's condition remains unstable, and multiple potential medical complications have arisen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of neutropenic fever, hypoxia, and tachypnea suggest worsening of his known multifocal pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The presence of pinkish, blood-tinged sputum and acute hematocrit drop raises concerns about pulmonary hemorrhage. If left untreated, it can result in significant bleeding and respiratory distress.
3. Large left-sided pleural effusion: The CT scan shows a large left-sided pleural eff"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
   - daily CXRs
   Vancomycin discontinued as patient hasn't grown MRSA, and has completed
   24 day course.  Voriconazole was discontinued after 20 day course as
   patient had rising LFTs.
   - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]),
   acyclovir([**7-25**])  for now as pt continues to be febrile with known
   pneumonia. Caspofungin started [**8-11**].
    - sputum cultures NGTD
   #Hyponatremia: Patient appears euvolemic, but could be slightly dry.
   Has been getting free water with his tube feeds for the past 3 days and
   was normonatremic before this started.  Free water could be the cause.
   SIADH is also a concern given cancer.
   -send urine osm, unine lytes and serum osm.
   -decrease amount of free water with tube feeds
   # Back peeling: Most likely secondary to prolonged pressure on back.
   Encourage sitting up and rotation as much as possible.  Currently sits
   up 4 hours per day.
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso.
   Received 5 units total.  Stabilized.
    - HCT stable
slowly trending down, today 23.2. His pulmonary status
   improved with blood earlier in the week, so transfused 1 unit after
   IVIG today
   -  Daily Hcts
   #Psychiatry: Patient is markedly depressed, however has declined
   psychiatry consult.
   - Continue liquid Prozac qd.
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   -f/u C. diff cultures
   - continue meropenem, acyclovir, caspofungin.
    - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
   - ID input and onc input appreciated
   - monitor ANCs daily
    - follow fever curve - tylenol prn
   # Transaminitis: Most likely secondary to voriconazole or acyclovir. ID
   has recommended checking EBV and CMV PCRs. Not attributed to
   antibiotics. Discontinued Vanc and Voriconazole on [**8-10**].  LFTs up
   today.
   -concern for invasive fungal infection.  Caspofungin started [**8-11**].
   Consider Liver imaging today.
   -          trend LFTs
   -         No abdominal pain currently.
   # Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/CLL: Last dose of
   Vincristine/Rituxan ([**8-4**]); IVIG ([**8-5**], [**8-13**]). Tolerated IVIG well.
   -continue Neupogen
   - ANCs decreasing
Onc has no new recs regarding this. No plan for
   chemo right now.
   - continue GCSF per Heme-Onc
   # FEN: no IVFs for now / electrolyte scales / Neutropenic diet. Started
   TFs on [**8-8**]. Hyponatremia thought to be secondary to TFs, thus TFs have
   been slowed down to 30cc/hr.
   -goal fluid balance negative 500-1L
   # Access: PICC, PIV
   # PPx: Thrombocytopenia, will use pneumoboots for now / bowel regimen
   # Contact: Wife (called on ICU transfer)

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. He has a history of receiving XRT (radiation therapy) and is currently being treated with IVIG, caspofungin, meropenem, and acyclovir.

Medical Complications:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient's worsening respiratory symptoms and O2 requirement may indicate worsening of his known multifocal pneumonia. Other possible causes include pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, or a large left-sided pleural effusion causing hypoxia.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient appears euvolemic but could be slightly dry. Free water with tube feeds and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) are potential causes. Further evaluation is needed with urine osm, urine electrolytes, and serum osm.
3. Back peeling: This is likely secondary to prolonged pressure on the back. Encouraging sitting up and rotation is recommended.
4. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit from 30% to 17% over 24 hours, with no evidence of GI bleed but concern for a pulmonary source. A pulmonary hemorrhage is a possibility, although this would typically be seen on a chest"

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's fever has been present for the past 24 hours and he received a blood transfusion due to a reduction in hematocrit. The patient is despondent and appears to be in good overall health, with no acute distress or signs of abuse. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 116/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, and PaO2 of 60 mmHg.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic anemia, chronic leukemia (CLL), squamous cell carcinoma, pneumonia, and a history of coronary artery disease with a previous NSTEMI. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. His lab results indicate neutropenia, liver function abnormalities, and an elevated LDH level. The patient's mental status is altered but has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Invasive fungal disease: The patient's low white blood cell count and liver function"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including coronary artery disease (CAD), pneumonia, squamous cell carcinoma, chronic leukemia (CLL), and depression. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia and is currently showing signs of fever, despondency, and altered mental status. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells due to a gradual reduction in hematocrit (Hct). The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for dry mouth, no epistaxis, and the presence of an endotracheal tube. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, pale conjunctiva, and normal cardiovascular examination. Laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, and elevated liver function tests, along with other abnormal lab values. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Invasive fungal disease: The patient's low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and elevated liver function tests may increase the risk of invasive fungal disease. Monitoring and low threshold for imaging are recommended.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and it is essential to continue antimicrobial therapy to complete the dose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease, pneumonia, squamous cell carcinoma, chronic leukemia (CLL), and chronic anemia. The patient presents with hypoxemia and fever. The patient's mental status is altered, but it has improved. The patient has neutropenia, liver function abnormalities, and is being treated for invasive fungal disease. The patient is receiving chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma and has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate). The patient is currently on the ICU and is expected to be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxemia indicates a potential risk for respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying lung disease.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and liver function abnormalities suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, which may be bacterial, viral, or fungal in nature. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) increases the risk of bleeding complications, including spontaneous bleeding or difficulty in clotting after procedures.
4. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's liver function abnormalities may indicate potential liver dysfunction or failure. This can lead to impaired metabolism of medications and toxins, as well as decreased production of essential proteins.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
   Vancomycin discontinued as patient hasn't grown MRSA, and has completed
   24 day course.  Voriconazole was discontinued after 20 day course as
   patient had rising LFTs.
   - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]),
   acyclovir([**7-25**])  for now as pt continues to be febrile with known
   pneumonia. Caspofungin started [**8-11**].
   -          sputum cultures NGTD
   #Diarrhea: Infectious vs antibiotic related vs. due to tubefeeds.
   -C. diff x3 negative.
   -coninue to send C. diff.
   -monitor I/O

   # Transaminitis: LFTs are at highest they've ever been today.
   Differential includes shock liver, infection, spread of cancer.
   Patient hasn
t had acute hypotensive episode to cause shock liver.
   -liver MRI to look for invasive fungal infection.
   -Caspofungin started [**8-11**].
   -          trend LFTs
   -         No abdominal pain currently.
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   -f/u C. diff cultures
   - continue meropenem, acyclovir, caspofungin.
    - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
    - ID input and onc input appreciated
    - monitor ANCs daily
    - follow fever curve - tylenol prn
   # Back peeling: Most likely secondary to prolonged pressure on back.
   Encourage sitting up and rotation as much as possible.  Currently sits
   up 4 hours per day.
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso.
   Received 5 units total.  Stabilized.
    - HCT stable
slowly trending down, today 23.2. His pulmonary status
   improved with blood earlier in the week, so transfused 1 unit after
   IVIG on [**8-12**]

   #Psychiatry: Patient is markedly depressed, agreed to psychiatry
   consult today
   - Continue liquid Prozac qd.
   # Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/CLL: Last dose of

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He is currently receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia. The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities and he is receiving multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient has a known multifocal pneumonia which may be worsening. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary hemorrhage and pleural effusion.
2. Febrile neutropenia: The patient is febrile with a low white blood cell count, putting him at risk for bacterial or fungal infections.
3. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing large liquid stools, which could be due to infectious causes, antibiotic-related diarrhea, or feeding tube-related issues.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. Differential diagnoses include shock liver, infection, or spread of cancer.
5. Anemia: The patient has had an acute drop in hematocrit levels, possibly due to a pulmonary source or other causes such as gastrointestinal bleeding or tumor burden.
6. Back peeling: The patient has developed back peeling, likely secondary to prolonged pressure on the back.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.
   # Multilobar pneumonia: In this immunocompromised patient the
   differential diagnosis is quite broad, including worsening of his known
   multifocal pneumonia as evidenced by his recent CTA and his O2
   requirement.  Also consider whether this is related to his IVIG
   infusion.  There was a question in the past that Rituxan may have
   caused hypoxia and tachypnea.  Consider pulmonary hemorrhage as pt now
   with acute hematocrit drop without evidence of GI bleeding and with
   pinkish, blood-tinged sputum first noted on [**2170-8-4**]; although low
   likelihood as not diffuse findings on CTA.  Lastly, on CT, it appears
   that there is a large L sided pleural effusion that may be causing some
   hypoxia.  Pt was noted to be increasingly tachypnic and transferred to
   ICU.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to acute drop in hematocrit (decreased O2
   carrying capacity). s/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided pleural
   effusion.
   - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
   Vancomycin discontinued as patient hasn't grown MRSA, and has completed
   24 day course.  Voriconazole was discontinued after 20 day course as
   patient had rising LFTs.
   - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1 [**7-22**]),
   acyclovir([**7-25**])  for now as pt continues to be febrile with known
   pneumonia. Caspofungin started [**8-11**].
    - sputum cultures NGTD
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden.
   -f/u C. diff cultures
   - continue meropenem, acyclovir, caspofungin.
    - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
    - ID input and onc input appreciated
    - monitor ANCs daily
    - follow fever curve - tylenol prn
   # Transaminitis: LFTs are at highest they've ever been today.  Consider
   imaging liver to look for invasive fungal infection.
   -Caspofungin started [**8-11**].
   -          trend LFTs
   -         No abdominal pain currently.
   # Back peeling: Most likely secondary to prolonged pressure on back.
   Encourage sitting up and rotation as much as possible.  Currently sits
   up 4 hours per day.
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso.
   Received 5 units total.  Stabilized.
    - HCT stable
slowly trending down, today 23.2. His pulmonary status
   improved with blood earlier in the week, so transfused 1 unit after
   IVIG on [**8-12**]

   #Psychiatry: Patient is markedly depressed, however has declined
   psychiatry consult.
   - Continue liquid Prozac qd.
   # Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/CLL: Last dose of
   Vincristine/Rituxan ([**8-4**]); IVIG ([**8-5**], [**8-13**]). Tolerated IVIG well.
   -continue Neupogen
   - f/u Onc recs
   - continue GCSF per Heme-Onc
   # FEN: no IVFs for now / electrolyte scales / Neutropenic diet. Started

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He is currently receiving external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and progressive anemia.

The patient has a broad differential diagnosis for his current symptoms, including worsening of his known multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, large left-sided pleural effusion, and drug fever. The patient underwent thoracentesis on August 7th for the left-sided pleural effusion.

The patient's antibiotics were changed to meropenem, acyclovir, and caspofungin due to persistent fever. The patient's leukocyte count is low, and he is febrile. There is a concern for febrile neutropenia, drug fever, or tumor burden as potential causes.

The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate transaminitis. Imaging of the liver is recommended to rule out invasive fungal infection. The patient's anemia is acute, with a significant drop in hematocrit without evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be due to a pulmonary source, but further evaluation is needed.

The patient's psychiatric status is notable for depression, but he has declined a psychiatry consult. He is currently on liquid Prozac daily.

In terms of ongoing management, the patient should continue supplemental oxygen, ne"

2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient has a history of pinkish, blood-tinged sputum, which may indicate pulmonary bleeding. However, this seems less likely since there are no diffuse findings on the chest CT.

3. Large left-sided pleural effusion: The patient has a large pleural effusion causing hypoxia, as seen on CT. Thoracentesis has already been performed for the pleural effusion.

4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, indicating possible liver damage. Differential diagnoses include shock liver, infection, or spread of cancer. Consideration should be given to invasive fungal infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state.

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, pneumonia, squamous cell carcinoma, chronic leukemia, and chronic anemia. He has been experiencing mild hypotension, copious diarrhea, and remains dispondent. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 121/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, warm skin, and normal neurological function. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's depression has improved, but he continues to be clinically depressed. The assessment and plan include monitoring for neutropenia, liver function abnormalities, coronary artery disease, pneumonia, squamous cell carcinoma, chronic leukemia, and chronic anemia. The patient's code status is DNR, and he will be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's low immune system due to leukemia and recent antibiotic use increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and symptoms is essential.
2. Hemodynamic instability: Mild hypotension was previously experienced by the patient. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management should be implemented to maintain hemodynamic stability.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's copious diarrhea needs to be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several ongoing medical conditions and complications. 

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has low levels of oxygen in their blood, which can be a result of respiratory problems or underlying lung disease.

2. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing copious diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Neutropenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, specifically neutrophils, making them more susceptible to infections.

4. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), indicating possible liver dysfunction. This could be due to various causes such as sepsis or invasive fungal infection.

5. Chronic anemia: The patient has a low red blood cell count, leading to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood.

6. Depression: The patient exhibits clinical signs of depression, and a psychiatry consultation has been requested.

7. Chronic conditions: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, squamous cell carcinoma, chronic leukemia, and chronic anemia. These conditions may contribute to the patient's overall weakened state.

8. Medications: The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics (Casopfungin, Acyclovir, Meropenem) to treat possible infections. However, the specific infection being targeted is not mentioned in the note.

9. Code status: The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status, indicating their preference not to receive life-sustaining interventions in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

10. Disposition: The patient's current plan is to be transferred to the floor from the ICU.

It is important to note that the patient's condition is complex, and careful monitoring and management are required to address the various medical complications and provide appropriate care."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea.  Patient has not been neutropenic
   x3 days.  Tachypnea and hypoxia have resolved. Fever curve coming down.
   # Multilobar pneumonia in immunocompromised: Abdominal CT on [**8-14**]
   showed continued RLL consolidations (? necrosis) and L lung base
   infiltrate, with bilateral small pleural effusions.  Patient continues
   to have tan colored sputum.   S/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided
   pleural effusion. Patient has completed a 24 day course of Vancomycin
   (no evidence of MRSA), and 20 day course of Voriconazole.  Acyclovir
   discontinued after 20 day course (no evidence of viral infection, and
   increased LFTs). All culture data to date is negative.
    - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
    - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1
   [**7-22**]), and Caspofungin (day 1 [**8-11**]).  Plan to d/c meropenem after 7 days
   without neutropenia (today is day 3)
    - sputum cultures NGTD
   #Diarrhea: Infectious vs antibiotic related vs. due to tubefeeds. Tube
   feeds changed to overnight only.  Diarrhea seems to have resolved with
   this change.
   -C. diff x3 negative.
   -coninue to send C. diff.
   -monitor I/O
s and give IVFs as necessary.
   # Transaminitis: LFTs peaked on [**8-14**]. Trending down this AM.
   Differential includes invasive fungal infection, spread of cancer, drug
   related (acyclovir vs. Caspofungin), IVIG related, viral hepatitis. MRI
   on [**8-14**] showed no abnormalities in liver.  Acyclovir discontinued [**8-14**],
   and LFTs seem to be trending down.  No evidence of viral pneumonia or
   infection requiring empriric anti-viral coverage.  CMV PCR negative.
   If begins to rise again, consider switching Caspofungin to Micofungin,
   less likely to affect liver. Patient does not endorse abdominal pain.
   -viral hepatitis serologies pending.
   -EBV PCR pending.
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden. All culture data to date has been negative.  Fever curve
   is coming down. Patient has not been neutropenic for 3 days.
   -C. diff cultures x3 negative
   - continue meropenem, caspofungin.
    - f/u all culture data and microbiology studies
    - ID input and onc input appreciated
   # Back peeling: Most likely secondary to prolonged pressure on back.
   Encourage sitting up and rotation as much as possible.  Currently sits
   up 4 hours per day, and has been walking with PT.
   # Anemia: Acute drop in Hct on [**8-5**] from 30 to 17 over 24 hours. No
   evidence of GI bleed, but worry for pulmonary source due to
   blood-tinged pinkish sputum.  Though, this would
ve been seen on chest
   CT.  Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed ruled out with CT torso.
   Received 5 units total.  Stabilized.
    - HCT stable
slowly trending down, today 25.2.  Will keep HCT > 21.
   -  Daily Hcts
   #Psychiatry: Patient is markedly depressed, agreed to psychiatry
   consult today.
   - Continue liquid Prozac qd.
   # Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/CLL: Last dose of
   Vincristine/Rituxan ([**8-4**]); IVIG ([**8-5**], [**8-13**]). Tolerated IVIG well.
   Oncology plans on Vincristine/Rituxan on [**8-18**] if patient continues to
   do well.
    -continue Neupogen
   - f/u Onc recs
   - continue GCSF per Heme-Onc
   # FEN: no IVFs for now / electrolyte scales / Neutropenic diet. Started
   TFs on [**8-8**]. TFs at night to reduce diarrhea.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), currently receiving radiation therapy (XRT). He presented with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and multifocal pneumonia. The patient's condition is improving, with the fever curve coming down and resolution of tachypnea and hypoxia. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided.

1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which may not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. This could indicate a drug-resistant infection or an invasive fungal infection. Monitoring of sputum cultures and continued use of meropenem and caspofungin are recommended.

2. Diarrhea: The patient has experienced diarrhea, which could be infectious, antibiotic-related, or due to tube feeds. Changing tube feeds to overnight only and sending C. difficile cultures are appropriate steps to address this issue.

3. Transaminitis: The patient had elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which have now trended down. The differential diagnosis includes invasive fungal infection, spread of cancer, drug-related effects (such as acyclovir or caspofungin), IVIG-related, or viral hepatitis. Further evaluation with viral hepatitis serologies and EBV PCR is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. M with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional
   lymph nodes and CLL currently receiving XRT presents with neutropenic
   fever, increasing hypoxia, tachypnea.  Patient has not been neutropenic
   x3 days.  Tachypnea and hypoxia have resolved. Fever curve coming down.
   # Multilobar pneumonia in immunocompromised: Abdominal CT on [**8-14**]
   showed continued RLL consolidations (? necrosis) and L lung base
   infiltrate, with bilateral small pleural effusions.  Patient continues
   to have tan colored sputum.   S/p thoracentesis on [**8-7**] for L sided
   pleural effusion. Patient has completed a 24 day course of Vancomycin
   (no evidence of MRSA), and 20 day course of Voriconazole.  Acyclovir
   discontinued after 20 day course (no evidence of viral infection, and
   increased LFTs). All culture data to date is negative.
    - continue supplemental oxygen, nebs
    - continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics of meropenem (day 1
   [**7-22**]), and Caspofungin (day 1 [**8-11**]).  Plan to d/c meropenem after 7 days
   without neutropenia (today is day 3)
    - sputum cultures NGTD
   #Diarrhea: Infectious vs antibiotic related vs. due to tubefeeds. Tube
   feeds changed to overnight only.  Diarrhea seems to have resolved with
   this change.
   -C. diff x3 negative.
   -coninue to send C. diff.
   -monitor I/O

   # Transaminitis: LFTs peaked on [**8-14**]. Trending down this AM.
   Differential includes invasive fungal infection, spread of cancer, drug
   related (acyclovir vs. Caspofungin), IVIG related, viral hepatitis. MRI
   on [**8-14**] showed no abnormalities in liver.  Acyclovir discontinued [**8-14**],
   and LFTs seem to be trending down.  No evidence of viral pneumonia or
   infection requiring empriric anti-viral coverage.  CMV PCR negative.
   If begins to rise again, consider switching Caspofungin to Micofungin,
   less likely to affect liver. Patient does not endorse abdominal pain.
   -viral hepatitis serologies pending.
   -EBV PCR pending.
   # Febrile Neutropenia: DDx consists of known multifocal pneumonia that
   is not responding to broad spectrum antibiotics vs. drug fever vs.
   tumor burden. All culture data to date has been negative.  Fever curve
   is coming down. Patient has not been neutropenic for 3 days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and CLL. He presented with neutropenic fever, hypoxia, tachypnea, and multifocal pneumonia. His condition is improving, with resolving fever, improved oxygenation, and decreased tachypnea. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics and antifungal medication. He has also received IVIG and is scheduled for further oncology treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multilobar pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which could potentially lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and respiratory failure if not adequately treated.
2. Neutropenia: The patient's low neutrophil count increases the risk of infections and may delay wound healing.
3. Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes indicate possible liver dysfunction, which could be due to drug toxicity or an underlying infection.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea may be related to antibiotic use or tube feeds, and if not managed appropriately, could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Anemia: The acute drop in hemoglobin level suggests possible bleeding, either from the gastrointestinal tract or lungs, which needs to be investigated further.
6. Back peeling: Prolonged pressure on the back can lead to skin breakdown and potential infection.
7. Depression: The patient is markedly depressed, and it is important to address this psychiatric issue to improve overall"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, increasing hypoxia, and tachypnea. The patient has completed a 24-day course of Vancomycin and a 20-day course of Voriconazole. Acyclovir was discontinued due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs) without evidence of viral infection. The patient's fever curve is coming down, and he has not been neutropenic for three days.

The patient has multifocal pneumonia, possibly with necrosis in the right lower lobe, and a left lung base infiltrate. He also has bilateral small pleural effusions. The patient underwent thoracentesis for the left-sided pleural effusion. All culture data to date is negative.

The patient has diarrhea, which seems to have resolved after changing tube feeds to overnight only. C. difficile tests have been negative three times, and cultures for sputum, nasogastric tube, and stool are ongoing.

The patient experienced an acute drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 30 to 17 over 24 hours, but it has stabilized. There is a concern for a pulmonary source of blood-tinged pinkish sputum, although this would have been seen on chest CT. Intraabdominal and retroperitoneal bleed have been ruled out"
