","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and a history of acute pulmonary edema and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was admitted with suspected acute pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory failure is hypercarbic/hypoxemic, likely secondary to acute pulmonary edema. She is currently on low-dose pressors due to sedation with propofol. There is a concern for delayed respiratory drive given metabolic alkalosis.

The patient also has shock, possibly related to sepsis, but not initially hypotensive until after intubation. The plan is to wean the patient off neo and move towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). Additionally, the patient has bacteremia/UTI with positive blood cultures from 11/20, and there is a Klebsiella UTI from Hospital1 183. Antibiotics have been initiated, and alternative HD access is being considered due to persistent bacteremia despite more than 48 hours of antibiotics.

There are concerns regarding cardiovascular stability, particularly hypertension and tachycardia during SBT, which might require aggressive control with intravenous antihypertensive and rate control. The patient's current medications include ASA, Colace, Amiodarone, Spiriva, Metoprolol (held), Insulin, Dorzolamide, and Fentanyl.

   74 yo F w/ ESRD, likely line infection and respiratory failure
   1.       Respiratory failure: No difficulty ventilating/oxygenating on
   vent overnight. Failed SBT [**1-23**] apnea. Likely flash in setting of
   sepsis.
     - Retry SBT this am and possibly extubate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and suspected line infection. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter, and glaucoma. She was previously on invasive ventilation and had a tunneled (Hickman) line that was stopped. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 103/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is still confused and receiving Coumadin and PO medications have been held. The patient has been weaned off pressors and has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rates between 100-120 bpm. There was one episode of flash edema and desaturation in the setting of atrial fibrillation, which improved with the administration of Lasix, diltiazem, and metoprolol. The patient's blood cultures revealed coag-negative Staphylococcus resistant to multiple antibiotics, while her urine culture showed K. pneumoniae resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. The patient's recent labs include a white blood cell count of 29.2 K/uL, hemoglobin"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter, and glaucoma. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to a line infection. She has been on invasive ventilation since November 21st and had a tunneled (Hickman) line placed on the same day. The line was removed on November 21st due to suspected bacteremia.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with heart rates ranging from 100 to 120 beats per minute. She has been receiving amiodarone for rate control. She also has a history of chest pain, which was initially thought to be acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but was later determined to be demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and tachycardia.

The patient's blood cultures showed resistance to multiple antibiotics, including penicillin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, and levofloxacin. However, she is sensitive to tetra cyclines, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, vancomycin, bactrim, and rifampin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 103/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 1060 mL and output of 38 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (29.2 K/uL), hemoglobin (8.9 g/dL), creatinine (6.5 mg/dL), and lactate acid (1.3 mmol/L). Other labs, including troponin T, CK/CKMB, PT/PTT/INR, and electrolytes, are within normal range or slightly elevated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently not experiencing difficulty ventilating or oxygenating on the ventilator. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted this morning, and possibly extubation if successful.
2. Bacteremia: Most likely line infection. Alternate access will be discussed with the renal team, and vancomycin will be continued.
3. Elevated troponin: Initially thought to be ACS but determined to be demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and tachycardia. Trop T levels have been trending up slightly, but EKG does not appear ischemic.
4. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis: Full dialysis was performed yesterday. Will hold off on using this line until discussion with the renal team.
5. Diabetes mellitus-type II: Continue home insulin regimen plus"

   pulmonary edema and hypoxemia now extubated and resolved.
   1. CNS bacteremia:  Suspect line infection.  So far, surveillance
   cultures are negative, line removed yesterday.  Some concern for
   possible endocarditis because of TTE with increased thickening of
   mitral valve.  Off pressors with line out.  WBC up slightly.
    - vancomycin for staph bacteremia; ceftriaxone for klebsiella UTI

   need TEE this admission but will wait until resp status is better
   - Surviellance cultures today
   2.  CV:  diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation
   - restart lopressor
   - reverse anticoagulation with vitamin K
   3. Neuro:  suspect global encephalopathy secondary to infection,
   critical illness.
   - neuro exam non-focal, but given possibility of endocarditis, if she
   fails to improve would consider MRI for evaluation of septic emboli.

","Summary:
- 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted with acute pulmonary edema requiring intubation.
- Persistent CNS bacteremia with line infection and possible endocarditis.
- Extubated yesterday after 24 hours.
- Off pressors.
- Remains confused.
- TTE shows possible thickening of the mitral valve.
- No known drug allergies.
- Last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
- Currently on various ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. CNS line infection: The patient has a persistent CNS bacteremia with a line infection, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. Possible endocarditis: The TTE results showing thickening of the mitral valve raise concerns for possible endocarditis. This condition can have serious consequences if not treated promptly.
3. Global encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and disorientation may be secondary to infection and critical illness. If not addressed, this could progress and lead to more severe neurological complications.
4. Diastolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing diastolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation, which require close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as heart failure or thromboembolic events.
5. Renal issues: The patient's renal function needs to be carefully managed due to ESRD. Access for hemodialysis needs to be established promptly and safely."

   Assessment and Plan
   74yoF with re-intubation and re-admission to ICU for hypoxemic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure in setting of likely flash pulmonary
   edema.
   1.       Respiratory failure:  Plan to obtain HD line today, dialysis.
   -          Lighten sedation and assess mental status
   -          Move to SBT after dialysis
   2.       CNS bacteremia: WBC remains elevated, afebrile.  Surveillance
   cultures negative.
   -          Vancomycin with HD
   -          F/u surveillance cultures
   -          TEE while intubated
   3.       Renal:
   -       HD today after line placement; needs FFP for elevated INR prior
   to new line placement
   4.       CV: No longer hypotensive
   -          Restart lopressor, titrate up today
   -          Will need titration of captopril following extubation and
   stabilization of BP
   -          Will need to restart coumadin once INR falls

","The patient is a 74-year-old female who was recently admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure secondary to acute pulmonary edema. She experienced another episode of acute respiratory distress with increased hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypertension, tachycardia, and was subsequently intubated on the floor. The patient became hypotensive and required pressors post-intubation. She was readmitted to the ICU overnight and showed improvement in oxygenation following the initiation of mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, and she is taking propofol, pantoprazole, ASA, simvastatin, and amiodarone. There are no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/56 mmHg to 103/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and she is in atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight is currently 54.5 kg, and she has gained 4.5 kg since admission.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 213 mL and output of 50 mL, resulting in a balance of 163 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 56-77 mmHg and central venous pressure (CVP) of 1-27 cmH2"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   74 yo F w/ ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD, Afib, recent septic shock on pressors
   with line infection and respiratory failure
   1. Respiratory failure: ABG showed hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   Likely volume overload in setting of awaiting HD and flash pulmonary
   edema.  Ddx includes lung or blood stream infection, MI
   - culture, cxr, trend CE.
   - Trend ABG, attempt to wean
   - will likely need HD tomorrow for volume removal.
   - Blood pressure control
   - Will attempt new arterial line for vent wean.
   .
   #. Septic shock from high-grade coag-negative Staph bacteremia and
   Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: HD line removed. Last growth of
   BCxs from [**11-19**]. ECHO shows question of vegetation.
   - f/u blood cxs, daily surveillance bcxs
   - on vanc for coag-negative staph bacteremia
   - on CTX for Klebsiella UTI
   - TEE now intubated
   .
   #. Demand ischemia: This is likely in the setting of sepsis, afib RVR.
   CKs flat but troponin peaked at 1.67.
   - cont. to monitor on telemetry
   - cont. ASA, BB, statin
   .
   #. End stage renal disease on hemodialysis: Last HD session was on
   [**11-20**]. Currently not overtly fluid overloaded.
   - Plan for temporary HD line tomorrow by IR (INR goal <3.5). Would not
   favor tunnelled line at this point given recent high grade bacteremia
   and need for high volumes of FFP to correct INR (IR requesting INR
   <1.5).
   - Plan for HD tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypoactive delirium: Pt currently delirious. Likely related to
   sedation medications while intubated as has not had HD since [**11-20**]. Also
   likely contributing are infection, uremia.
   - cont. to monitor MS
   - NPO for now
   - may need to give metoprolol IV for rate control
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus-type II:
   - Continue her home insulin regimen plus sliding scale.
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - Home metoprolol + captopril for rate and afterload reduction.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home simvastatin, at lower dose due to interaction with
   amiodarone.
   .
   #. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter:
   - continue home dose of amiodarone
   - cont. metoprolol
   - holding warfarin given supratherapeutic INR (was given vitamin K
   today).

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent septic shock on pressors with line infection and respiratory failure. 

She has several medical complications that need to be addressed. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload in the setting of awaiting HD and flash pulmonary edema. Differential diagnosis includes lung or blood stream infection, as well as myocardial infarction. 

- Culture and chest X-ray should be obtained to identify any potential infections.
- Trend ABG and attempt to wean from mechanical ventilation.
- The patient will likely require HD tomorrow for volume removal.
- Blood pressure control is necessary.

2. Septic shock from high-grade coag-negative Staph bacteremia and Klebsiella urinary tract infection: The patient's HD line has been removed, and the last growth of blood cultures was from 11/19. An echocardiogram shows a question of vegetation.

- Follow-up blood cultures should be done daily.
- Antibiotics should be continued for coag-negative Staph bacteremia.
- Antibiotics should also be continued for Klebsiella UTI.
- Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) should be performed while the patient is intubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent septic shock. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and line infection. She has been extubated but experienced mental status changes and is now reintubated. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/57 mmHg to 154/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has increased from 50 kg at admission to 54.5 kg currently.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. Other lab values such as troponin T, TCO2, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal range. The patient's blood cultures have cleared, but she still has a significant white blood cell count.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is doing well on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) without difficulty ventilating or oxygenating. Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) on SBT.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD, Afib, recent septic shock on pressors
   with line infection and respiratory failure
   1. Respiratory failure: ABG showed hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   Likely volume overload in setting of awaiting HD and flash pulmonary
   edema.  Ddx includes lung or blood stream infection, MI
   - culture, cxr, trend CE.
   - Trend ABG, attempt to wean
   - will likely need HD tomorrow for volume removal.
   - Blood pressure control
   - Will attempt new arterial line for vent wean.
   .
   #. Septic shock from high-grade coag-negative Staph bacteremia and
   Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: HD line removed. Last growth of
   BCxs from [**11-19**]. ECHO shows question of vegetation.
   - f/u blood cxs, daily surveillance bcxs
   - on vanc for coag-negative staph bacteremia
   - on CTX for Klebsiella UTI
   - TEE now intubated
   .
   #. Demand ischemia: This is likely in the setting of sepsis, afib RVR.
   CKs flat but troponin peaked at 1.67.
   - cont. to monitor on telemetry
   - cont. ASA, BB, statin
   .
   #. End stage renal disease on hemodialysis: Last HD session was on
   [**11-20**]. Currently not overtly fluid overloaded.
   - Plan for temporary HD line tomorrow by IR (INR goal <3.5). Would not
   favor tunnelled line at this point given recent high grade bacteremia
   and need for high volumes of FFP to correct INR (IR requesting INR
   <1.5).
   - Plan for HD tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypoactive delirium: Pt currently delirious. Likely related to
   sedation medications while intubated as has not had HD since [**11-20**]. Also
   likely contributing are infection, uremia.
   - cont. to monitor MS
   - NPO for now
   - may need to give metoprolol IV for rate control
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus-type II:
   - Continue her home insulin regimen plus sliding scale.
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - Home metoprolol + captopril for rate and afterload reduction.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home simvastatin, at lower dose due to interaction with
   amiodarone.
   .
   #. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter:
   - continue home dose of amiodarone
   - cont. metoprolol
   - holding warfarin given supratherapeutic INR (was given vitamin K
   today).
   .
   #. Glaucoma:
   - continue home regimen of eye drops
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and recent septic shock due to line infection and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter, and glaucoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results indicate hypercapnic respiratory failure, suggesting a likely volume overload. This could be due to flash pulmonary edema or an underlying lung infection. Monitoring ABG trends, attempting to wean off the ventilator, and considering hemodialysis for volume removal may be necessary.

2. Sepsis from High-Grade Coag-Negative Staph Bacteremia and Klebsiella UTI: The patient had a previous growth of bacteria in blood cultures from November 19th. An ECHO showed possible vegetation, indicating potential endocarditis. Continuous blood cultures, daily surveillance blood cultures, and ongoing antibiotic therapy (Vanc for coag-negative staph bacteremia and CTX for Klebsiella UTI) are recommended.

3. Demand Ischemia: The patient has flat CK levels but a peaked troponin level, suggesting possible demand ischemia, especially in the setting of sepsis and atr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), currently experiencing acute pulmonary edema and requiring re-intubation. She has a history of central nervous system (CNS) line infection and presents with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is concern for metastatic CNS infection, as bacteremia has resolved but persistent white blood cell count (WBC) and low-grade fevers remain. Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and fevers are also present. The patient has diastolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation, with ongoing treatment for rate control. Renal function is compromised, with recent hemodialysis performed yesterday. The patient requires further evaluation and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially necessitating mechanical ventilation support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. CNS Infection: Although bacteremia has resolved, the presence of persistent WBC and low-grade fevers suggests the possibility of a metastatic CNS source. This could result in the development of meningitis or brain abscesses, requiring neurosurgical intervention and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Klebsiella UTI: The ongoing Klebsiella UTI can lead to sepsis and systemic infection if not effectively managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the ICU. She underwent hemodialysis yesterday and required pressors during the procedure. Following hemodialysis, she developed hypotension again and has been on norepinephrine support. She also has acute pulmonary edema and is intubated. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. Her medications include propofol, phenylephrine, metoprolol, and others. She has a history of ESRD, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 138/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm. She has gained weight since admission. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,512 mL and an output of 1,575 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 63 mL. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and recent septic shock on pressors with line infection and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated but has now been extubated successfully. The patient's current condition includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, bacteremia, respiratory failure (stable post-extubation), hypotension (not in shock), and C. difficile infection. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 119 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 103/49 mmHg to 132/58 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal limits at 37.2°C. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for episodes of AFib, which were successfully managed with IV diltiazem. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 28.2 K/uL and elevated creatinine levels ranging from 3.3 to 6.5 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures have cleared, and the catheter tip was positive for Staphylococcus coagulase-negative. The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and is being treated with"

   Assessment and Plan
   74yoF with ESRD; extubated yesterday after flash pulmonary edema in
   setting of afib [**Year (4 digits) **], HTN; with CNS bacteremia from line infection; now
   with cdiff colitis.
   1.       Hypoxemia: Increased O2 and some increased WOB this morning.
   Suspect non-pulmonary etiology given clear lung exam, versus recurrent
   acute pulmonary edema.
   -          Aim for better afib [**Year (4 digits) **] control today
   -          Treat HTN/BP; titrate metoprolol PO and IV prn. If
   difficulty controlling HR and BP, would add labetolol drip.
   -          If Afib elevated without increase in BP, would start IV
   amiodarone for short term.
   -          CXR
   2.       Cdiff:
   -          add PO vancomycin; continue flagyl IV
   -          If worsening abdominal exam/sepsis, increasing lactate;

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She was admitted with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema, as well as CNS bacteremia. The patient was extubated yesterday but experienced periodic episodes of agitated behavior requiring IV diltiazem. This morning, she is less responsive and more tachypneic with relatively stable oxygenation and stable ABG. She tested positive for Clostridium difficile (CDiff) yesterday and started on Flagyl. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's increased oxygen requirement and work of breathing suggest a non-pulmonary etiology of hypoxemia, possibly due to cardiac issues or other factors. The clear lung exam makes recurrent acute pulmonary edema less likely. Better atrial fibrillation control is needed today, and treatment for hypertension and better blood pressure control should be continued.

2. Cdiff Colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with Cdiff colitis and should continue with PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl. If there is a worsening abdominal exam or sepsis, an abdominal CT should be done to evaluate for toxic megacolon or surgical disease.

3. CNS Bacteremia: Surveillance cultures should be negative. Vancomycin IV should be continued, dosed after HD, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) tomorrow should be performed to"

   74yoF with ESRD; extubated yesterday after flash pulmonary edema in
   setting of afib RVR, HTN; with CNS bacteremia from line infection; now
   with cdiff colitis.
   1.       Hypoxemia: Increased O2 and some increased WOB this morning.
   Suspect non-pulmonary etiology given clear lung exam, versus recurrent
   acute pulmonary edema.
   -          Aim for better afib RVR control today
   -          Treat HTN/BP; titrate metoprolol PO and IV prn. If
   difficulty controlling HR and BP, would add labetolol drip.
   -          If Afib elevated without increase in BP, would start IV
   amiodarone for short term.
   -          CXR
   2.       Cdiff:
   -          add PO vancomycin; continue flagyl IV
   -          If worsening abdominal exam/sepsis, increasing lactate;
   would obtain abdominal CT for evaluation of toxic megacolon or surgical
   disease
   3.       CNS Bacteremia: surveillance cultures negative
   -          continue vancomycin IV, dosed after HD
   -          TEE tomorrow to evaluate for endocarditis

   with line infection and c. diff
   #. Respiratory failure: Respiratory status remains tenuous following
   extubation.  She is at high risk for repeat flashing/hypercarbic
   respriatour failure.
   - Metoprolol/amlodipine for rate/BP control given Hx of flash w/ afib.
   Titrate to HR < 100.
   - consider nitro/labetolol gtt prn
   - standing tylenol for pain and fever control given tachypnea
   .
   #Bacteremia: Cultures cleared, cath tip positive.  Vanc trough
   therapeutic.  Back pain has resolved
   - Vanc QHD, dose by levels
   - f/u blood cultures
   - D/C ceftriaxone
   - TEE tomorow
   .
   # C. diff: Likely cause of persistant high WBC.  Lactate mildly
   elevated at 2.5
   - IV flagyl and PO vancomycin
   - will check KUB to r/o toxin megacolin.
   - consider [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult if worsening although patient unlikely to be a
   surgical candidate.
   .
   #Hypotension: Occurs with sedation + afib.
   - Metoprolol and amiodarone for Afib control
   - Neo if needed
   .
   #. End stage renal disease on hemodialysis: Dialysed yesterday through
   temp fem line.
   - likely HC on monday
   - appreciate renal recs.
   - Phos binders

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and recent septic shock with line infection and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She is currently in the ICU and has been extubated. Her respiratory status remains tenuous with a high risk for repeat flashing/hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has bacteremia that has cleared, but there is still a positive culture from the catheter tip. Her white blood cell count is elevated due to C. diff infection. She is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to sedation and atrial fibrillation. She has a history of diabetes mellitus-type II, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter, and glaucoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and she is at high risk for repeat flashing/hypercarbic respiratory failure. This could lead to further deterioration in her respiratory function and potentially necessitate reintubation.
2. Bacteremia: Although the patient's bacteremia has cleared, the presence of a positive culture from the catheter tip suggests a potential line infection. This may require further antibiotic treatment and close monitoring for signs of infection.
3. C. diff infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count is likely due to the C. diff"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently experiencing respiratory failure secondary to acute pulmonary edema. She also has CNS bacteremia from a line infection and was recently diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (Cdiff). 

The patient's recent events include being positive for Cdiff and starting PO vancomycin/IV flagyl. She was also restarted on neo overnight in response to hypotension secondary to atrial fibrillation (afib). Her lactate level is mildly elevated but trending down. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 87 bpm (with a range of 66-125 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 119/56 mmHg to 90/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute (with a range of 20-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on nasal cannula for respiratory support and her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.54, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 215, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L. 

The patient's physical examination reveals somnolence, tender abdomen in the left lower quadrant, and bilateral below-knee amputations (BKA). Her laboratory results show an increased white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   74yoF with ESRD, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to afib
   RVR and acute pulmonary edema; also has CNS bacteremia from line
   infection and recently diagnosis.
   1.       Septic Shock/Cdiff: new pressor requirement, worsening mental
   status, increased WBC.
   -          PO vancomycin/IV flagyl.
   -          Send blood cultures today.
   -          Obtain abd CT with contrast; likely surgical consult pending
   CT results.
   -          Repeat Lactate
   2.       CNS Bacteremia:
   -          hold on TEE for now given acuity of decline.
   -          Continue IV vancomycin for bacteremia.
   -          Surviellance cultures negative.
   3.       Afib: unclear how her tachycardia affects her hemodynamics.
   -          Will start IV amiodarone drip for better rate control.
   -          Hold metoprolol currently.
   4.       Renal:  Will discuss with renal regarding HD today
   - Likely to dialyze today, but given HoTN might not tolerate HD.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Hold enteral feeds given decline
