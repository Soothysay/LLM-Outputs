   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) : Patient initially presented with
   hypotension, thought to be urosepsis in setting of grossly positive
   U/A. Urine culture is negative.  Neurogenic shock in the setting of
   recent orthopedic injury is also a possibility.  A line placed
   yesterday. Adrenal insufficiency unlikely given elevated cortisol
   level. She does have an elevated bilirubin; question possibility of
   acalculous cholecystitis.
   -          Continue Cipro x 7d
   -          Follow urine output and mental status closely; if
   maintaining appropriately hold off on IVFs
   -          RUQ U/S
   -          If blood pressures remain low and no source of hypotension
   identified, consider starting Midodrine
 THORACIC / LUMBAR / SACRAL FRACTURE (TLS WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY):
   Patient with recent fall resulting in T11 burst fracture.
   -          TLSO brace placement
   -          Possible surgical intervention once medically stable
   -          f/u ortho reccs
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Patient presented
   with Cr of 2.2 on admission. Decreased to 1.1 today. Likely pre-renal
   in setting of hypotension.
 THROMBOCYOPENIA: Patient noted to have low platelets on admission.
   Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has no prior history.
   -          Continue to trend daily platelets
   -          f/u heparin antibodies
 HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Patient presented with elevated bilirubin on
   admission. No abdominal complaints. Now coming down.
   -          Continue to trend daily
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: Continue insulin sliding scale with
   FS QID.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: Holding outpatient regimen given current
   hypptension. Restart once patient is hemodynamically stable for >24
   hours.
 DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LIPID DISORDER): Patient on
   Gemfibrozil as outpatient; being held now. Consider restarting once
   able to tolerate Pos.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is a T11 burst fracture and hypotension. 

The 24-hour events include a transthoracic echo, arterial line placement, and an episode of irregular tachycardia. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on 06/29/2191 at 02:36 AM.

The patient has no known drug allergies. Infusions include ICU medications and other medications, but specific names are not mentioned.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the below-mentioned changes. The flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

Lab results indicate elevated bilirubin levels, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, low platelet count, increased potassium levels, and decreased sodium levels. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), as well as increased levels of calcium and phosphorus.

Assessment and plan include hypotension (likely neurogenic shock due to recent orthopedic injury), a thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture (T11 burst fracture), acute renal failure (pre-renal), thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, type II diabetes mellitus, benign hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (multi-lumen and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a T11 burst fracture, hypotension, and various medical conditions including pancytopenia, renal failure, hyperbilirubinemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a blood pressure of 101/56 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has an arterial line, central line, and multi-lumen catheter in place. Laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, glucose, and liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which could be due to urosepsis, neurogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to identify the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, characterized by low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This condition requires further investigation to determine the cause and develop a management plan.

3. Renal Failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure on admission, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. The renal failure is likely pre-renal in nature due to hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted with a T11 burst fracture and hypotension. The note highlights several medical complications that can arise due to the patient's condition. These include:

1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's decreased urine output (UOP) early in the afternoon and subsequent fluid administration suggest a possible decline in kidney function.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The low blood pH value indicates an imbalance in acid-base levels, which may be related to the patient's respiratory support or inadequate tissue perfusion.

3. Diabetes mellitus type II (DM): The elevated glucose levels recorded in the lab results indicate impaired glucose regulation, potentially due to stress-induced hyperglycemia or underlying diabetes.

4. Hypertension: Although the patient is currently hypotensive, a history of hypertension is noted in the assessment and plan section.

5. Dyslipidemia: Abnormal lipid profile is indicated by elevated cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipids, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

6. Thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture (TLS) with spinal cord injury: The patient's condition involves a spinal injury at the T11 level, leading to potential neurological deficits and paralysis.

7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings throughout the day show consistently low values, indicating inadequate tissue perfusion and potential shock state.

8. Respiratory support: The patient requires mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and"

 ATRIAL FLUTTER/FIBRILLATION:  EKG this morning consistent with atrial
   flutter/fibrillation with elevated HRs in 140
s.  Her BPs during this
   time was also in the low 90
s suggesting some hemodynamic instability.
   Cardiology was called and recommended loading patient with Amiodarone.
   -          Cardiology consult
   -          Amiodarone 150mg IV x1, then Amiodarone 1mg/min for 6 hours,
   Amiodarone 0.5mg/min; then transition to PO regimen.
   -          Consider beta-blocker for rate control once BP stabilizes
   -          No acute indications for anti-coagulation; will need to be
   discussed later
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) : Patient initially presented with
   hypotension, thought to be urosepsis in setting of grossly positive
   U/A. Urine culture is negative.  She also had a RUQ U/S yesterday which
   was unrevealing. Neurogenic shock in the setting of recent orthopedic
   injury is also a possibility. Adrenal insufficiency unlikely given
   elevated cortisol level.  Given recent atrial flutter/fibrillation,
   this may be explaining her hypotension.
   -          d/c Cipro since she has completed 3d course
   -          Treatment of rhythm as above
   -          Follow urine output and mental status closely
 THORACIC / LUMBAR / SACRAL FRACTURE (TLS WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY):
   Patient with recent fall resulting in T11 burst fracture.  TLSO brace
   was placed yesterday.
   -          f/u ortho reccs
 PANCYTOPENIA: Patient noted to have pancytopenia on labs yesterday.
   Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has no prior history of this.  Hemolysis labs negative.
   Heparin dependent antibodies were  negative.
   -          Hematology consult today for bone marrow biopsy
 HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Patient presented with elevated bilirubin on
   admission. No abdominal complaints. Now stable at 2.3. RUQ U/S
   yesterday with no findings. No need to follow daily.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: Patient
s blood sugars well
   controlled. Continue insulin sliding scale with FS QID.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: Holding outpatient regimen given current
   hypotension.
 DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LIPID DISORDER): Patient on
   Gemfibrozil as outpatient; being held now. Consider restarting once
   stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and recent orthopedic injury. She presented with hypotension, atrial flutter/fibrillation, and pancytopenia. The patient also has a thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture with spinal cord injury. Imaging showed splenomegaly but no evidence of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. A CT angiography was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, initially thought to be urosepsis but urine culture is negative. Neurogenic shock due to recent orthopedic injury is also a possibility. Adrenal insufficiency is unlikely given the elevated cortisol level. Recent atrial flutter/fibrillation may be explaining her hypotension.
2. Atrial Flutter/Fibrillation: The patient's EKG this morning showed atrial flutter/fibrillation with elevated heart rates in the 140s. Her blood pressure during this time was also in the low 90s, suggesting some hemodynamic instability. Cardiology recommended loading the patient with amiodarone and considering a beta-blocker for rate control once blood pressure stabilizes.

   Urine [**6-26**]: pending
   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) : Patient initially presented with
   hypotension, thought to be urosepsis in setting of grossly positive
   U/A. Urine culture is negative.  Neurogenic shock in the setting of
   recent orthopedic injury is also a possibility.  A line placed
   yesterday. Adrenal insufficiency unlikely given elevated cortisol
   level. She does have an elevated bilirubin; question possibility of
   acalculous cholecystitis.
   -          Continue Cipro x 7d
   -          Follow urine output and mental status closely; if
   maintaining appropriately hold off on IVFs
   -          RUQ U/S
   -          If blood pressures remain low and no source of hypotension
   identified, consider starting Midodrine
 THORACIC / LUMBAR / SACRAL FRACTURE (TLS WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY):
   Patient with recent fall resulting in T11 burst fracture.
   -          TLSO brace placement
   -          Possible surgical intervention once medically stable
   -          f/u ortho reccs
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Patient presented
   with Cr of 2.2 on admission. Decreased to 1.1 today. Likely pre-renal
   in setting of hypotension.
 PANCYTOPENIA: Patient noted to have pancytopenia on labs this
   morning. Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has no prior history of this.
   -          Hemolysis labs
   -          f/u heparin antibodies
   -          Consider hematology consult to consider bone marrow tap
 HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Patient presented with elevated bilirubin on
   admission. No abdominal complaints. Now coming down.
   -          Continue to trend daily
   -          RUQ U/S given hypotension
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: Patient
s blood sugars well
   controlled. Continue insulin sliding scale with FS QID.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: Holding outpatient regimen given current
   hypptension. Restart once patient is hemodynamically stable for >24
   hours.
 DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LIPID DISORDER): Patient on
   Gemfibrozil as outpatient; being held now. Consider restarting once
   stable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture with spinal cord injury, renal failure, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with hypotension thought to be urosepsis. Although the urine culture is negative, there is a possibility of developing septic shock due to other sources of infection.

2. Neurogenic shock: The patient has a recent history of an orthopedic injury, which raises the possibility of neurogenic shock. This condition occurs due to damage to the nervous system, leading to abnormal regulation of blood pressure.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: Although the patient has an elevated cortisol level, there is still a possibility of developing adrenal insufficiency, which can cause hypotension.

4. Acalculous cholecystitis: The patient has an elevated bilirubin level, and there is a question about the possibility of acalculous cholecystitis. This condition involves inflammation of the gallbladder without the presence of gallstones and can lead to complications such as infection and organ failure.

5. Spinal cord injury complications: The patient has a T11 burst fracture resulting in spinal cord injury. Complications associated with spinal cord injury include pressure ulcers, respiratory infections"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female who presented with hypotension, thought to be urosepsis initially. However, urine culture is negative, and neurogenic shock due to recent orthopedic injury is a possibility. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and is currently in the ICU due to a T11 burst fracture from a fall. She also has pancytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation, and her heart rhythm has been fluctuating between sinus rhythm and other arrhythmias. A CT angiography was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which came back negative. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 99/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her current weight is 109 kg, and her height is 60 inches. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg, and she has received a total of 6,165 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 1,460 mL of urine. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and glucose levels. However, her potassium and magnesium levels are slightly elevated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypotension, thought to be urosepsis initially. However, urine culture is negative. Neurogenic shock and adrenal insufficiency were also considered but unlikely. The patient has a history of recent orthopedic injury. RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction but did reveal splenomegaly. A CTA was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative. The patient received mucomyst and bicarb during the study. Haptoglobin and LDH levels were within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension (not shock): The patient initially presented with hypotension, which is still persisting. Possible causes include urosepsis, neurogenic shock, or an unknown source. The patient is being closely monitored for urine output and mental status, and IV fluids are being held off if maintaining appropriately. Midodrine may be considered if blood pressures remain low and no source of hypotension is identified.

2. Thoracic/Lumbar/Sacral Fracture (TLS with spinal cord injury): The patient has a recent fall resulting in a T11 burst fracture. A TLSO brace was placed yesterday, and possible surgical intervention is being considered once the patient is medically stable. Orthopedic recommendations are to be followed.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has been noted to have pancytopenia on labs. Hemolysis labs are pending, and the patient's heparin antibodies should be followed up. A hematology consult may be necessary to consider a bone marrow tap.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient found to be in atrial fibrillation with
   increased heart rates yesterday morning. She was loaded with Amiodarone
   and she converted quickly to sinus rhythm. Appreciate cardiology
   consult recommendations.
   -          Complete Amiodarone 0.5mg/kg infusion; then transition to
   oral regimen
   -          Given low blood pressures will hold off on beta-blocker.
   -          No acute indications for anti-coagulation; will need to be
   discussed on the floor
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) : Patient initially presented with
   hypotension, thought to be urosepsis in setting of grossly positive
   U/A. Urine culture is negative. ? TB given sterile pyruria.  She also
   had a RUQ U/S yesterday which was unrevealing. Neurogenic shock in the
   setting of recent orthopedic injury is also a possibility. Adrenal
   insufficiency unlikely given elevated cortisol level.  [**Month (only) 60**] be explained
   by atrial fibrillation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of recent orthopedic injury. They were loaded with Amiodarone and quickly converted to sinus rhythm. The patient's blood pressures have been low, so they will hold off on beta-blocker administration. No acute indications for anti-coagulation were found. The patient has pancytopenia, which may be related to chronic liver disease. Hematology was consulted, and hepatitis serologies should be followed up. A bone marrow biopsy is recommended. The patient has hyperbilirubinemia without abdominal complaints, and the RUQ ultrasound showed no findings. The patient's blood sugars are well controlled, and they have a history of type II diabetes mellitus. Hypertension is being held due to current hypotension. Dyslipidemia is also present, and the patient was on Gemfibrozil as an outpatient. Restarting the medication once stable is considered. The patient has a thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture with spinal cord injury, and they are not a surgical candidate at this time. TLSO brace was placed, and orthopedic follow-up is recommended. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which could be explained by adrenal insufficiency. However, the elevated cortisol level makes this less likely.

2. Amyloidosis: Given the new onset of atrial fibr"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with multiple medical complications. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and atrial fibrillation. The patient's history of alcohol abuse may be contributing to her condition. She has been loaded with Amiodarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and will transition to Amiodarone PO daily. Toprol 25mg daily is planned when the patient's blood pressure can tolerate it. Coumadin will be started once cleared by surgery. Continuous KOH monitoring is required upon discharge, with follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

The patient has pancytopenia and splenomegaly likely secondary to chronic hepatitis due to NASH, alcoholic hepatitis, or viral hepatitis. Recommended tests include checking hepatitis serologies, vitamin B12 level, methylmalonic acid level, and homocysteine level to rule out vitamin B12 deficiency.

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  EKG this morning consistent with atrial
   flutter/fibrillation with elevated HRs in 140
s.  Her BPs during this
   time was also in the low 90
s suggesting some hemodynamic instability.
   Cardiology was called and recommended loading patient with Amiodarone.
   -          Cardiology consult
   -          Amiodarone 150mg IV x1, then Amiodarone 1mg/min for 6 hours,
   Amiodarone 0.5mg/min; then transition to PO regimen.
   -          Consider beta-blocker for rate control once BP stabilizes
   -          No acute indications for anti-coagulation; will need to be
   discussed later
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) : Patient initially presented with
   hypotension, thought to be urosepsis in setting of grossly positive
   U/A. Urine culture is negative.  She also had a RUQ U/S yesterday which
   was unrevealing. Neurogenic shock in the setting of recent orthopedic
   injury is also a possibility. Adrenal insufficiency unlikely given
   elevated cortisol level.  Given recent atrial flutter/fibrillation,
   this may be explaining her hypotension.
   -          d/c Cipro since she has completed 3d course
   -          Treatment of rhythm as above
   -          Follow urine output and mental status closely
 THORACIC / LUMBAR / SACRAL FRACTURE (TLS WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY):
   Patient with recent fall resulting in T11 burst fracture.  TLSO brace
   was placed yesterday.
   -          f/u ortho reccs
 PANCYTOPENIA: Patient noted to have pancytopenia on labs yesterday.
   Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has no prior history of this.  Hemolysis labs negative.
   Heparin dependent antibodies were  negative.
   -          Hematology consult today for bone marrow biopsy
 HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Patient presented with elevated bilirubin on
   admission. No abdominal complaints. Now stable at 2.3. RUQ U/S
   yesterday with no findings. No need to follow daily.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: Patient
s blood sugars well
   controlled. Continue insulin sliding scale with FS QID.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: Holding outpatient regimen given current
   hypotension.
 DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LIPID DISORDER): Patient on
   Gemfibrozil as outpatient; being held now. Consider restarting once
   stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and an elevated heart rate.
- Atrial fibrillation was confirmed on EKG and the patient was loaded with Amiodarone.
- The patient's blood pressure during this time was low, suggesting hemodynamic instability.
- Cardiology recommended transitioning to Amiodarone PO daily and considering a beta-blocker for rate control once the patient's blood pressure stabilizes.
- There are no acute indications for anticoagulation, but it will need to be discussed later.
- The patient initially presented with hypotension, which was initially thought to be urosepsis. However, the urine culture is negative, ruling out infection.
- Neurogenic shock in the setting of a recent orthopedic injury is also a possibility, but further evaluation is needed.
- Adrenal insufficiency is unlikely given the elevated cortisol level.
- The patient's recent atrial flutter/fibrillation may be explaining the hypotension.
- Cipro was discontinued since the patient completed a three-day course.
- Treatment of rhythm as above and close follow-up of urine output and mental status are recommended.
- The patient has a thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture (TLS with spinal cord injury) resulting from a fall. A TLSO brace was placed yesterday.
- Follow-up with orthopedics is advised.
- The patient has pancytopenia on labs, with no prior history of this"
