","The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic back/knee pain who presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient experienced slight non-specific chest discomfort upon arrival to the CCU, which has since resolved and not recurred.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/42-130/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. She is on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen delivery.

Her physical examination reveals no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, no jugular venous distention (JVD), and no obvious aortic stenosis or regurgitation. Her cardiac examination shows a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur most noted at the right upper sternal border (RUSB), with no third or fourth heart sounds appreciated. Her lung examination is unremarkable, and her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and obese without any bruits or hepatosplenomegaly.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 23000/mm³, hemoglobin of 13"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old diabetic woman with hypertension who presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where a stent was placed in the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient experienced slight non-specific chest discomfort upon arrival to the CCU, which has since resolved and not recurred.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - The patient initially presented with chest pain and EKG changes indicating a possible STEMI. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention, which was provided through cardiac catheterization and PCI.
2. Myocardial Infarction (MI) - Although the initial CK was negative, the elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial injury. Further cardiac biomarkers should be monitored to assess for ongoing myocardial damage.
3. Hypertension - The patient has a history of hypertension, which needs to be managed and controlled during her hospital stay.
4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) - The patient's diabetes needs to be managed with insulin therapy while in the ICU, and oral hypoglycemics can be resumed once she is stable.
5. Back/Knee Pain - The patient has chronic back/knee pain, for which acetaminophen can be given as needed for pain control.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis -"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, coronary ischemia). She was admitted to the ICU due to chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has been experiencing episodes of chest pressure while walking, which resolves with rest. She also reports nausea and vomiting. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/54 mmHg to 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -45 mL. She is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention. The patient has been NPO after midnight and is expected to undergo a stress test to further evaluate her condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of acute coronary syndrome and reduced ejection fraction (35-40%), there is a possibility of developing cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by poor tissue perfusion and hypotension.
2. Myocardial infarction: The presence of focal severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal third of the left ventricle, consistent with stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) or mid/distal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with diabetes and hypertension who presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), specifically stenting of the distal LAD. The patient experienced sudden onset of severe chest pain this morning in the setting of her flooded basement. Her troponin levels are elevated, indicating cardiac injury. She has been started on aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, high-dose statin, and telepaque. Further assessments include serial cardiac biomarkers, ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess for systolic dysfunction, and PT/PTT/INR per protocol. The patient's blood pressure is currently normotensive, and she is being restarted on hyzaar when able to confirm home dose. Her diabetes medications have been held, and she is being covered with subcutaneous insulin while in the hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina due to residual coronary artery disease.
2. Heart failure or worsening cardiac function due to systolic dysfunction or complications from the PCI procedure.
3. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, which can occur in the setting of acute MI or subsequent cardiac damage.
4. Stroke, particularly in the context of atrial fibrillation or other"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic back/knee pain. She presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for a STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where she had stenting of the distal LAD performed. The patient also experienced sudden onset of shortness of breath and cough this morning. She has been diagnosed with acute stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) or mid/distal wraparound LAD infarction, with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. Her current medications include aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, high-dose statin, and tele. She is also on prophylactic heparin and insulin for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's condition puts her at risk for further cardiac issues such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: Given the recent onset of shortness of breath and cough, the patient may be susceptible to respiratory infections or exacerbation of underlying respiratory conditions.
3. Renal complications: The use of contrast during cardiac catheterization can potentially lead to acute kidney injury.
4. Thromboembolic complications: As the patient is on anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of bleeding or thromboembolic events like deep vein"

   in the setting of seeing her basement flooded. ECG did show findings
   concerning for STEMI, with ST elevations in the lateral leads. CK was
   negative at the OSH, and troponin was elevated at 0.45 (troponin i).
   Troponins trending down yesterday. The patient is s/p cath, where she
   had stenting of the distal LAD performed. The pt does report some
   nonspecific chest discomfort while walking yesterday that spontaneously
   resolved. Also reports some ?anginal symptoms at home assoc. with
   stress, but is not able to give a very clear story.
   - continue ASA, plavix
   - continue metoprolol, titrating up as needed to keep HR in the 60's
   - continue high-dose statin
   - continue tele

   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Blood pressure is slightly improved but not significantly
   Creatinine is rising - the overall likelihood is intrinsic renal
   disease - coupled with volume depletion
   now two liters with slight increase in blood pressure but clinical
   evidence of volume overload
   will keep even at this point.
   evaluate bloody stool
   transfer to medical floor
   await pathology from fat pad biopsy

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and hypertension who presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where she had stenting of the distal LAD performed. The patient reports nonspecific chest discomfort while walking that spontaneously resolved, as well as anginal symptoms at home associated with stress. Her current vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 105/54 mmHg, heart rate of 64 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. She is alert and oriented, with no significant abnormalities on physical examination. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels but declining trend, with other values within normal limits. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent myocardial infarction: Given the patient's history of STEMI and ongoing chest pain, there is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction.
2. Heart failure: The patient's ejection fraction is reported to be 35-40%, indicating reduced cardiac function, which increases the risk of heart failure.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient's use of metoprolol and the presence of an implanted pacemaker may predispose her to arrhythmias such as bradycardia or atrial fibrillation.
4. Kidney injury: The rising creatinine levels suggest possible intrinsic renal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic back/knee pain. She presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal LAD. She also experienced sudden onset of shortness of breath this morning. Troponin levels are elevated at 0.45 (troponin i), and the patient is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial infarction: The patient's symptoms, EKG changes, and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of a myocardial infarction. This condition can lead to further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Heart failure: Given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, along with the recent myocardial infarction, there is a risk of developing heart failure. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient's age, medical history, and recent myocardial infarction increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias. These can include atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and potential complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. If"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 y/o diabetic woman with HTN who presents with chest pain and EKG
   changes concerning for STEMI, now s/p cardiac cath and PCI
   .
   # ACS, STEMI: The patient developed sudden onset of SSCP this morning
   in the setting of seeing her basement flooded. ECG did show findings
   concerning for STEMI, with ST elevations in the lateral leads. CK was
   negative at the OSH, and troponin was elevated at 0.45 (troponin i).
   Troponins trending down yesterday. The patient is s/p cath, where she
   had stenting of the distal LAD performed. The pt does report some
   nonspecific chest discomfort while walking yesterday that spontaneously
   resolved. Also reports some ?anginal symptoms at home assoc. with
   stress, but is not able to give a very clear story.
   - continue ASA, plavix
   - continue metoprolol, titrating up as needed to keep HR in the 60's
   - continue high-dose statin
   - continue tele
   - PT consult
   - stress test this afternoon to assess for any other coronary ischemia
   # HTN: Normotensive at this time.
   - restart hyzaar if BP allows, will need to confirm home dose
   - continue to trend BP's
   - beta blocker as above
   # DM:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - cover with SSI while in house
   # Chronic Back/Knee Pain:
   - acetaminophen PRN for pain control at this time
   ICU Care

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and hypertension who presented with chest pain and EKG changes concerning for STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the distal LAD. The patient also reported nonspecific chest discomfort while walking and some anginal symptoms at home. She has been experiencing sudden onset of severe chest pain this morning, which is consistent with stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) or mid/distal wraparound LAD infarction. Her ejection fraction (EF) is 35-40%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's symptoms and EKG changes indicate possible cardiac ischemia, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
2. Heart Failure: Given the patient's reduced ejection fraction, there is a risk of developing heart failure, especially if the myocardial damage persists or worsens.
3. Arrhythmias: In the setting of myocardial infarction and reduced EF, the patient may be at increased risk of developing arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Thrombosis: Despite PCI, there is still a possibility of thrombus formation within the coronary arteries, leading to recurrent ischemic events.
5. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections"
