","Summary:
The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. The patient has an elevated INR of 10.6, which indicates a high risk of bleeding. Vitamin K has been administered to help lower the INR levels. The patient is currently on multiple medications and infusions in the ICU. Their vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, decreased blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an input of 925 mL and output of 1280 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 555 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an ABG result of ///23/. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, and tone. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and potassium levels. Other lab results, including PT/PTT/INR, glucose, and electrolytes, are also provided. The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory failure and is receiving ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, bleeding due to high INR levels, electrolyte imbalances, infection indicated by elevated white blood cell count, and possible thromboembolic events due to immobilization and hypercoagulable state."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, who underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and has a history of CV, presenting with community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and is experiencing worsening respiratory symptoms. There is a possibility of progressing to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.6-1.8, indicating chronic kidney injury. The recent IVF administration and high creatinine levels suggest an acute exacerbation of kidney injury.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD is worsening, as evidenced by the addition of albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers. If not adequately managed, it could lead to a COPD exacerbation.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and the INR is significantly elevated at 10.6. This places the patient at risk for bleeding complications. Rate control measures need to be implemented carefully due to the patient's hypotension.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Holding home medications for hypertension may be necessary until the infection is resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, asplenia, bioprosthetic aortic valve, and previous community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was admitted with elevated INR and dropping hematocrit. The patient has been treated with antibiotics (Azithromycin and CTX) for the pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/37 mmHg to 121/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals normal general appearance, neurologically alert, moving all four limbs, clear to auscultate lungs, with a loud S4 heart sound. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with a large reducible ventral hernia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient is afebrile, but still has an increasing white blood cell count, and chest X-ray shows right lower lobe/right middle lobe consolidation. The patient will continue to be followed closely, and a CT scan of the chest is recommended for chronic right lower"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, splenectomy, bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and previous community-acquired pneumonia. The patient presents with community-acquired pneumonia, chronic kidney injury, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, and there is no mention of current treatment for it. If the patient's respiratory status deteriorates, supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation may be required.

2. Pneumonia progression: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient continues to have leukocytosis and CXR infiltrates. Monitoring for clinical improvement is essential, and further interventions such as bronchoscopy or intravenous antibiotics might be necessary if the pneumonia worsens.

3. Acute on chronic kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial. Encouraging oral fluids and managing the underlying causes of kidney injury are important.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. It is essential to monitor his heart rhythm and adjust anticoagulation therapy based on INR levels. Rate control may be challenging due to relative hypotension, and digoxin can be continued."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of valve replacement, asplenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and previous colon and renal cell carcinomas. The patient presented with respiratory failure, community-acquired pneumonia, elevated INR, and dropping hematocrit.

The patient has been diagnosed with right middle lobe and right lower lobe air space consolidation with associated small right pleural effusion. The radiology report suggests an infectious etiology, but an underlying neoplasm such as lymphoma or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma cannot be excluded. Follow-up radiographs are recommended to confirm resolution.

The patient's anemia and elevated INR are attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of brown well-formed guaiac-positive stools. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis is planned to evaluate for a retroperitoneal bleed.

The patient's acute-on-chronic kidney injury is related to volume depletion, and he has received intravenous fluids. The baseline creatinine level was 1.6-1.8, and it has fallen to 2.0.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being restarted on warfarin due to the therapeutic INR range. Metoprolol dosing has been changed to 25 mg.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infectious complications: The patient's community-acquired pneumonia may progress"

   82 M with COPD, asplenic, w/ bioprosthetic aortic valve, who presents
   with a community acquired pneumonia, elevated INR and dropping
   hematocrit.
   # CAP: Afebrile, with mild improvement in leukocytosis. CT c/w RML/RLL
   consolidation, likely PNA, but cannot rule out lympadenopathy or
   malignancy. Remains on Ctx and Azithro (started [**3-6**])
   - f/u cx
   - Sputum culture if patient provides sample
   - given remote splenectomy, check vaccinations are up to date
   - trend fever curve, WBC count
   #Anemia & Elevated INR: Hct remains low, with significant Hct drop
   since admission. No abdominal bleed on preliminary CT report, but does
   have dark, tarry stools. Transfused RBC overnight with sub-optimal
   response. Need to be aggressive in searching for ongoing bleed, given
   anti-coagulation for valve replacement
   - Check PM Hct
   - GI consult for ? endoscopy; consider upper GI lavage if not a
   candidate for endoscopy
   - F/u abd/pelvis CT
   - Maintain active type & screen
   - Start PPI
   # Acute on chronic kidney injury. Creatinine improving to 1.8 today.
   Likely [**2-24**] volume depletion given high BUN/creatinine ratio, mild
   hypernatremia. Baseline creatinine 1.6-1.8
   - Will encourage PO fluids
   - IV bolus vs blood transfusion if continues to appear dry
   # COPD- not on any nebs as outpatient
   - ipra/alb nebs prn
   - add steroids if persistent wheezing
   # Atrial fibrillation: INR now subtherapeutic after vitamin K doses.
   Restarted heparin gtt to bridge back to therapeutic range, which is
   2.5-3.5.
   - restart coumadin to get INR back to therapeutic range. If active
   bleed detected on endoscopy, will have to hold long-acting
   anticoagulation
   - c/w Heparin gtt
   - continue Digoxin
   - continue home Metoprolol but change dosing to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, asplenia, and a bioprosthetic aortic valve. He presents with community-acquired pneumonia, elevated INR, and dropping hematocrit. The patient has been started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for pneumonia. 

The patient's anemia and elevated INR are concerning, as his hematocrit remains low despite transfusion. He has dark, tarry stools, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the bleed, especially considering his anticoagulation therapy for the valve replacement. 

The patient also has acute-on-chronic kidney injury, with improving creatinine levels. This is likely due to volume depletion and hypernatremia. Encouraging oral fluids and IV boluses may help improve hydration status. 

The patient has a history of COPD but has not been on any nebulizers as an outpatient. Nebulizer treatment with ipratropium-albuterol should be initiated, and steroids may be added if there is persistent wheezing. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation, and his INR is now subtherapeutic after vitamin K doses. Heparin has been restarted to bridge back to therapeutic INR range, which is 2.5-3.5. It is important to restart warfarin to maintain therapeutic INR levels, but if an active bleed is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of CAP (Chest Pain). The patient has been receiving empiric antibiotics for pneumonia, specifically azithromycin and ceftriaxone. There is a concern for endobronchial or post-obstructive etiology due to recurrence of pneumonia in a similar location to the previous episode.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/39 to 117/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including heparin for anticoagulation, bronchodilators for COPD, and vitamin K for coagulopathy. The patient's renal function is being monitored, as the creatinine level is trending back down to the baseline value of 1.8.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a ventral hernia, and neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to three things."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of valve replacement, respiratory failure, COPD, asplenia, and a bioprosthetic aortic valve. He presents with community-acquired pneumonia, elevated INR, and dropping hematocrit. The patient has been started on IV PPI and is receiving antibiotics for the pneumonia. His anemia and elevated INR are being closely monitored, and he has received a blood transfusion with suboptimal response. There are concerns about ongoing bleeding, and a GI consult has been requested for possible endoscopy. The patient also has acute on chronic kidney injury, likely secondary to volume depletion, and mild hypernatremia. His COPD is being managed with nebs as needed. The patient has atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation therapy needs to be carefully managed due to the risk of bleeding. The patient's nutritional status is stable, and he is on prophylactic heparin and PPI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has dark, tarry stools, and the preliminary CT report does not indicate an abdominal bleed. However, given his anticoagulation therapy and remote splenectomy, there is a concern for ongoing bleeding. Further evaluation with GI consult for possible endoscopy is recommended.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia with right middle lobe and lower lobe consolidation. It is important to monitor his"

   lower lobe and, to a lesser extent, the right middle lobe. Possible
   narrowing or part opacification of the right lower lobe bronchus. An
   underlying mass is not excluded.
   2. Right pre-bronchial and pretracheal mild adenopathy.
   3. Small right pleural effusion, with adjacent atelectasis at the right
   lung base. Minimal left pleural effusion.
   4. Lobulated soft tissue in the splenic resection bed could represent
   regenerative residual spleen. Less likely, given history of renal
   neoplasm, a local recurrent neoplasm is not excluded. The appearance is
   not typical of an acute retroperitoneal hemorhage.
   5. Aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta in the subrenal
   portion, increased from prior.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia. He has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and anticoagulation therapy. The patient received three units of blood transfusion and is experiencing borderline hypotension. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 107/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has right lower extremity edema. His lab results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. The patient's imaging shows a right basilar opacity on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels, suggesting possible acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which may indicate hypernatremia. Repletion of free water should be considered to correct this imbalance.
3. GI bleed: The patient's history of GI bleeding and current use of anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of further bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and stool output is important.

   Assessment and Plan
   #Anemia & Elevated INR: Transfused two units of pRBC yesterday and did
   not respond appropriately. Did have an episode of melanotic stools,
   however. Need to be aggressive in searching for ongoing bleed, given
   anti-coagulation for valve replacement and atrial fibrillation; also
   need to be aggressive in maintaining patient hemodynamic stability
   - GI recommended normalizing INR for 24-48 hours, no plans for
   Endoscopy for now (given intubation risk), goal Hct >25, PPI IV BID
   - Check Hct q8 hours, then transfuse per below
   - Transfuse two more units pRBC today given Hct <25
   - Goal INR 1.0
   - Maintain active type & screen
   - Consider arterial line placement
   # CAP: Afebrile, with improvement in leukocytosis. CT c/w RML/RLL
   consolidation, likely PNA, but cannot rule out lympadenopathy or
   malignancy. Remains on Ceftriazone and Azithromycin (started [**3-6**])
   will discontinue Azithromycin today
   - Follow-up all outstanding cultures
   - Sputum culture if patient provides sample
   - Given remote splenectomy, check vaccinations are up to date
   - Trend fever curve, WBC count
   # Hypotension:  Baseline blood pressures SBP130s per OMR. Lactate
   within normal limits
   - continue Digoxin
   - consider holding home Metoprolol today
   # Acute on chronic kidney injury/hypernatremia. Creatinine
   stable/improved at 1.6 today. Likely [**2-24**] volume depletion given high
   BUN/creatinine ratio, mild hypernatremia. Baseline creatinine 1.6-1.8.
   Of note, patient has been consuming high volumes of PO fluids with
   significant urine output. Serum sodium self corrected yesterday.
   # COPD- not on any nebs as outpatient
   - ipra/alb nebs prn
   - add steroids if persistent wheezing
   # Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 3. In discussions with
   Cardiology and GI, lower risk of thromboembolic event than risks of GI
   bleed.
   - Normalize INR for now
   - Hold coumadin, heparin gtt
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has experienced several events over the past 24 hours. Hypernatremia resolved without intervention, but the patient had an episode of melanic stools. The hematocrit (Hct) level was 27.7 at 6 pm and decreased to 26.6 by 9 pm. The international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.9 at 6 pm. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics (azithromycin and ceftriaxone) as part of their treatment. They are currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) through an infusion.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/53 mmHg to 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient has atrial fibrillation.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,532 mL and a total output of 2,870 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 662 mL. The patient is receiving oxygen and has been given blood products.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 23.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 9."

   Assessment and Plan
   #Anemia & Elevated INR: Transfused two units of pRBC yesterday and did
   not respond appropriately. Did have an episode of melanotic stools,
   however. Need to be aggressive in searching for ongoing bleed, given
   anti-coagulation for valve replacement and atrial fibrillation; also
   need to be aggressive in maintaining patient hemodynamic stability
   - GI recommended normalizing INR for 24-48 hours, no plans for
   Endoscopy for now (given intubation risk), goal Hct >25, PPI IV BID
   - Check Hct q8 hours, then transfuse per below
   - Transfuse two more units pRBC today given Hct <25
   - Goal INR 1.0
   - Maintain active type & screen
   - Consider arterial line placement
   # CAP: Afebrile, with improvement in leukocytosis. CT c/w RML/RLL
   consolidation, likely PNA, but cannot rule out lympadenopathy or
   malignancy. Remains on Ceftriazone and Azithromycin (started [**3-6**])
   will discontinue Azithromycin today
   - Follow-up all outstanding cultures
   - Sputum culture if patient provides sample
   - Given remote splenectomy, check vaccinations are up to date
   - Trend fever curve, WBC count
   # Hypotension:  Baseline blood pressures SBP130s per OMR. Lactate
   within normal limits
   - continue Digoxin
   - consider holding home Metoprolol today
   # Acute on chronic kidney injury/hypernatremia. Creatinine
   stable/improved at 1.6 today. Likely [**2-24**] volume depletion given high
   BUN/creatinine ratio, mild hypernatremia. Baseline creatinine 1.6-1.8.
   Of note, patient has been consuming high volumes of PO fluids with
   significant urine output. Serum sodium self corrected yesterday.
   # COPD- not on any nebs as outpatient
   - ipra/alb nebs prn
   - add steroids if persistent wheezing
   # Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 3. In discussions with
   Cardiology and GI, lower risk of thromboembolic event than risks of GI
   bleed.
   - Normalize INR for now
   - Hold coumadin, heparin gtt
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI
   # Access: peripherals; will pursue further peripheral access
   # Communication: Patient, lives with wife
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: ICU pending evaluation of GI bleed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient experienced hypernatremia, which resolved without intervention.
2. The patient had an episode of melanic stools, indicating a possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
3. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been fluctuating between 21.1% and 27.7%, indicating anemia. The INR (International Normalized Ratio) values are elevated, suggesting a coagulopathy or impaired blood clotting.
4. The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBCs) but did not respond appropriately. This could indicate ongoing bleeding despite transfusion.
5. The patient has a history of valve replacement, specifically aortic bioprosthetic valve replacement (AVR).
6. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation (ventilator).
7. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, indicating an infection.
8. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed right middle lobe (RML)/right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, suggesting pneumonia.
9. The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is concern for hypotension.
10. The patient has an acute kidney injury with a stable creatinine level of 1.6.

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. The note states that the patient had a spell of melanic stools, which could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's Hct (hematocrit) levels are also decreasing, further suggesting ongoing bleeding. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including azithromycin, ceftriaxone, pantoprazole, and digoxin. They are also being treated for atrial fibrillation with an unknown rate control medication.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. The respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are within normal limits. The patient is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a low hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL. The platelet count is also low at 17,800 /uL. The INR (international normalized ratio) is elevated at 1.9, indicating a bleeding risk. The white blood cell count is elevated at 23.6 K/uL, suggesting an infection.

The patient has a history of COPD and kidney injury. They are also being evaluated for potential acute kidney injury and hypernatremia.

In summary, the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis due to the elevated white blood cell count and infection, worsening anemia, and worsening kidney function."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted with pneumonia (PNA) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's oxygen requirement is still high at 93-95% on 4L NC. His heart rate remains elevated at 100-110 beats per minute, so metoprolol has been started at 12.5 mg q4h. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is stable, and an endoscopy is not planned at this time. He has a small to moderate right-sided pleural effusion, and an ultrasound should be done to further evaluate it. The patient's electrolytes are stable, except for low magnesium, which has been repleted. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is currently on ceftriaxone for his pneumonia. His lactic acid level is elevated, and his creatinine level is within normal limits. The patient's COPD is not currently being treated with nebs, but he should receive ipra/alb nebs prn and possibly steroids if he has persistent wheezing. His atrial fibrillation is being managed with digoxin and lopressor. The patient's kidney function is stable, and his sodium level is high. He is on prophylactic heparin and PPI. The patient has a positive H."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of valve replacement, COPD, CAP, atrial fibrillation, and concern for GI bleed. He is currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, coagulopathy, anemia, elevated INR, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 96/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases with rhonchi, warm skin, and edema in both lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 22.5 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 26.9%, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low magnesium and potassium. Imaging studies show a small-to-moderate right layering effusion on decubitus chest X-ray and an increase in right lower lobe opacity with slight deviation of the mediastinum to the right on port chest X-ray. Microbiology results indicate contamination with upper respiratory secretions. The patient is currently on various medications including diltiazem, proton pump inhibitors, ceftriaxone, and digoxin.

   Assessment and Plan
   82-year-old man with ongoing GI bleed (in setting of anticoagulation),
   CAP, COPD, and AVR.
   From a respiratory standpoint he has improved (both subjectively and
   objectively).  We will continue antibiotics for CAP as well as
   nebulizers.  He has completed azithro course; continue ceftriaxone for
   now.
   Main clinical decision today is about his parapneumonic effusion.  On
   ultrasound exam at bedside, fluid is clearly present but is largely
   subpulmonic.  Technically, would be challenging and higher-than-usual
   risk for pneumothorax.  Combined with coagulopathy, this makes the
   risk/benefit balance for thoracentesis challenging.  We will therefore
   consult interventional pulmonary for their opinion about risk/benefit
   balance for thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance, with FFP coverage.
   For his GI bleed and acute blood loss anemia: stable at present.  H
   pylori positive
 beginning treatment.  Continue PPI.  GI following.
   Cardiology also following
 challenging balance of risks/benefits
   related to anticoagulation in setting of valve.
   History of pneumonia
 will need outpatient evaluation to fully exclude
   endobronchial disease.  At present, risks outweigh benefits for bronch.
   Acute renal failure
 improved closer to baseline
   AVR
 once bleeding quiescent for several days, would consider resuming
   anticoagulation in consultation with cardiology/GI.
   AFib
 better rate controlled.  Follow dig levels.
   Splenectomy
 ensure vaccines up to date prior to discharge.

","The patient is an 82-year-old man with ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), coagulopathy, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrioventricular replacement (AVR). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been stabilized. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 113/49 to 131/64 mmHg, heart rate between 90 and 111 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 8.4 g/dL, indicating anemia likely due to acute blood loss from the GI bleed.
- His white blood cell count is elevated at 22.5 K/uL, suggesting an ongoing infection.
- The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 23.5 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 46.9 seconds, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.2, indicating significant coagulopathy.
- The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.28, indicating respiratory acidosis.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has shown improvement in his respiratory condition both subjectively and objectively. He will continue receiving antibiotics for CAP as well as nebulizers. The use of systemic steroids has been withheld for now, and azithromycin will be discontinued tomorrow.

For the patient's GI bleed and acute blood loss anemia, he will be transfused with two units of blood. Pantoprazole (Protonix) will be continued, and the patient will have gastrointestinal follow-up. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/49 mmHg to 131/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 22.5 K/uL. His blood glucose levels have been within a relatively normal range, ranging from 104 mg/dL to 122 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), and lactate, as well as decreased levels of calcium"
