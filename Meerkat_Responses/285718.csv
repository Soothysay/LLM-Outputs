   This is an 81 yo female with end-stage COPD, DM2, CRF, anemia of renal
   disease, diastolic CHF, h/o DVT, PMR, OA, OSA, h/o C diff who presents
   with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: History of CO2 retention with CO2s
   running 60s-70s. Has previously been on BiPap at night to control CO2
   but more recently found that O2 sats of 91-92% sleeping at an angle
   were sufficient on recent hospitalization. Unclear precipitant of
   current decompensation but may have recieved too much O2 at rehab.
   Course complicated by left retrocardiac opacity and possible pneumonia.
   -Ween vent with goal O2 sats 88-92%, recheck ABG, will retry SBT today
   -Prednisone 60mg daily
   -Standing nebs
   -Vanc/Cefepime for presumed HAP in LLL until cultures negative
   -F/U culture data
   .
   # NSVT: Likely from adrenergic surge.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   .
   # ARF: Baseline of 2.0 and currently improved from last discharge at
   3.2. Likely resolving ATN. Appears euvolemic. Urine lytes consistent
   with pre-renal
   -Avoid further nephrotoxins
   -Maintain euvolemia
   .
   # UTI: Previous E.coli UTI isolated on culture prior to discharge on
   last admission. Not covered by levofloxacin she was d/c'd on. Current
   U/A only mildly positive.
   -Cefepime as above
   -F/U culture

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal failure, anemia of renal disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, history of deep vein thrombosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and previous Clostridium difficile infection. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include ventricular tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, and possible pneumonia. 

The patient's medical history and current medications include hypercarbic respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal failure, anemia of renal disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, history of deep vein thrombosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and previous Clostridium difficile infection. She is currently taking prednisone for COPD exacerbation, nebs for respiratory support, vancomycin/cefeepime for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia, metoprolol for ventricular tachycardia, and other medications for her chronic conditions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (69-88 bpm), blood pressure of 161/68 mmHg (101/48-161/70 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (10-26 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 91%, and sinus rhythm. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 5.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, glucose of 107 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, sodium of 149 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 103 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.6 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas results indicate a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 75 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 243 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 91%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels of 40 mEq/L.

Imaging studies reveal a chest X-ray showing slightly worse right-sided opacities and stable retrocardiac opacity. Microbiology results indicate the presence of multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora on gram stain, and preliminary respiratory culture results are pending.

The patient's plan of care includes weaning off mechanical ventilation with a target oxygen saturation of 88-92% and rechecking arterial blood gases, retrying spontaneous breathing trial, administering prednisone for COPD exacerb"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including end-stage COPD, DM2, CRF, anemia of renal disease, diastolic CHF, h/o DVT, PMR, OA, OSA, h/o C diff. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a history of CO2 retention with CO2 levels running in the 60s-70s. She has been previously on BiPap at night to control CO2 but more recently found that O2 sats of 91-92% sleeping at an angle were sufficient on a recent hospitalization. The current decompensation may have been precipitated by receiving too much O2 at rehab. Her course is complicated by left retrocardiac opacity and possible pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), a heart rate of 88 bpm (69-88), a blood pressure of 161/68 mmHg (101/48-161/70 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (10-26), and an oxygen saturation of 91%. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 75 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 243.

The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, and a respiratory system compliance of 26.3 cmH2O/mL. The endotracheal tube is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a pressure support of 10 cmH2O, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 30%.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight/obese appearance, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, endotracheal tube, OG tube, and symmetric chest expansion with resonant percussion note. There is also trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, glucose of 107 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, sodium of 149 mEq/L, chloride of 40 mEq/L, magnesium of 31.1%, and total CO2 of 45 mmHg. Imaging shows slightly worse right-sided opacities and stable retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray. Microbiology reports indicate multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora on gram stain, and respiratory culture pending.

The patient has been diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, urinary tract infection, and depression. The plan includes weaning from mechanical ventilation with a target oxygen saturation of 88-92%, rechecking arterial blood gas, and retrying spontaneous breathing trial today. Prednisone 60mg daily, standing nebulizers, Vanc/Cefepime for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia in the left lower lobe until cultures are negative, and follow-up culture data have been ordered.

For acute renal failure, the plan is to avoid further nephrotoxins, maintain euvolemia, and possibly restart half of home lasix to maintain euvolemia. For urinary tract infection, cefepime and follow-up culture have been ordered. For diastolic congestive heart"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, OSA, and CHF who was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday morning but passed it this morning. However, she developed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during the SBT. The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, heparin sodium, albuterol, prednisone, and others. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/68 mmHg to 105/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 75 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 243. The physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular rapid respirations, and minimal edema. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low potassium levels, and normal liver function. The chest X-ray shows a retrocardiac opacity in the right lower lobe. The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and has a history of cardiac risks including coronary artery disease and diastolic congestive heart failure.

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, heparin sodium, cefepime, vancomycin, albuterol, prednisone, and insulin sliding scale. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated blood pressure. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. Her labs show an elevated white blood cell count and elevated potassium levels. The chest X-ray reveals a retrocardiac opacity in the right lower lobe. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, potential COPD exacerbation, hyperoxia, or discontinuation of CPAP, as well as possible volume overload. She also has an infection being treated empirically for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Additionally, she has cardiac risks due to coronary artery disease and a history of congestive heart failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further episodes of arrhythmia, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential cardiovascular complications due to her history of CHF and CAD."

   with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: History of CO2 retention with CO2s
   running 60s-70s. Has previously been on BiPap at night to control CO2
   but more recently found that O2 sats of 91-92% sleeping at an angle
   were sufficient on recent hospitalization. Unclear precipitant of
   current decompensation but may have recieved too much O2 at rehab.
   Course complicated by left retrocardiac opacity and possible pneumonia.
   Now extubated but still slightly hypercarbic.
   -O2 sats 88-92%, Bipap at night, monitor ABGs
   -IS to bedside, chest PT
   -Decrease Prednisone to 50mg daily
   -Standing nebs
   -Stop Vanc as pneumonia less likely, con

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage COPD, DM2, CRF, anemia of renal disease, diastolic CHF, h/o DVT, PMR, OA, OSA, and h/o C diff. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently extubated but still slightly hypercarbic. The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications, including respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, renal failure, ventricular tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, and more.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates a high risk for further respiratory complications. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABGs is necessary.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The presence of E. coli in the urine culture suggests a UTI. Continuing with cefepime and following up with culture data is important.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of CRF and acute renal failure. Maintaining euvolemia and avoiding further nephrotoxins is crucial.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT): The patient experienced NSVT, which may be related to adrenergic surge. Restarting metoprolol is recommended.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or infections. Regular skin assessment and appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage COPD, DM2, CRF, anemia of renal disease, diastolic CHF, h/o DVT, PMR, OA, OSA, and h/o C diff. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute), urinary tract infection, renal failure (acute), ventricular tachycardia (non-sustained), and possible pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition may require continued respiratory support and monitoring.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of UTI and current findings suggest a possible UTI. Antibiotics have been started, but further evaluation and management are needed.
3. Renal Failure (Acute): The patient has acute renal failure, which may be related to pre-renal azotemia. Close monitoring of kidney function and fluid balance is necessary.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT): The patient experienced a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia episode. Further evaluation and monitoring for arrhythmias are needed.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's imaging suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics have been initiated, and further assessment of the pulmonary condition is required."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, CHF, and OSA who was admitted with acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been extubated and is currently on nocturnal BiPAP. She is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to her underlying conditions. The patient also has an unidentified pulmonary infection and a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli. There is evidence of non-stable ventricular tachycardia prior to extubation, which has improved with metoprolol. Her renal function is improving, and she has been restarted on home doses of lasix. The patient's current vital signs are within normal range, and she is awake and alert. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying conditions such as COPD and OSA put her at risk for further respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.
2. Pulmonary Infection: The presence of respiratory flora in the lab results suggests a potential pulmonary infection. This should be treated appropriately with antibiotics based on the sensitivity results.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli. It is important to continue treatment with cefipime and await sensitivities of the urine culture.
4. Non-Stable Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT): The patient experienced NSVT prior to extubation but improved with met"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including end-stage COPD, DM2, CRF, anemia of renal disease, diastolic CHF, h/o DVT, PMR, OA, OSA, h/o C diff. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 96/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient has been on BiPAP support and has shown improvement in her pH levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic CHF: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure. It is important to monitor her fluid balance and maintain euvolemia to prevent exacerbation of CHF symptoms.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated CO2 levels can lead to respiratory acidosis and potential complications such as increased intracranial pressure, confusion, and lethargy.
3. UTI: The patient has a suspected urinary tract infection, and it is important to follow up with culture/sensitivity results and complete the appropriate antibiotic treatment.
4. Swallowing difficulties: The patient has swallowing difficulties, and it is crucial to provide nectar-thick liquids to prevent aspiration pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo female with end-stage COPD, DM2, CRF, anemia of renal
   disease, diastolic CHF, h/o DVT, PMR, OA, OSA, h/o C diff who presents
   with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: History of CO2 retention with CO2s
   running 60s-70s. Has previously been on BiPap at night to control CO2
   but more recently found that O2 sats of 91-92% sleeping at an angle
   were sufficient on recent hospitalization. Unclear precipitant of
   current decompensation but may have recieved too much O2 at rehab.
   Course complicated by left retrocardiac opacity and possible pneumonia.
   Now extubated but still slightly hypercarbic.

   failure.
   1.       Respiratory Failure:  improving; chronically hypoxemic with
   multiple etiologies.  Better PaCO2 on BiPAP overnight.
   - restart home dose of lasix; likely mildly hypervolemic; continue
   gentle diuresis given improving renal failure.
   - Change home bipap settings (14/8).
   - Decrease prednisone to 40mg, plan taper.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, OSA/OHS, and CHF who is currently in the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has tolerated new settings of BiPAP and showed improvement in her PaCO2 levels overnight. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although she is mildly hypervolemic and has mild edema. Her respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results indicate a slightly elevated PaCO2 level. The patient's physical examination reveals clear anterior lungs with diminished breath sounds and no wheezing. She is awake, alert, and oriented to place, but thinks it is the year 1900. Her labs show normal WBC count, slightly elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and her troponin-T level is negative. Imaging studies have been performed but are not mentioned in the progress note. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged. The review of systems is also unchanged from admission except for the current respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening respiratory failure, cardiac complications due to her history of CAD and CHF, renal insufficiency indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, OSA/OHS, and CHF, admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently on BiPAP and tolerating the settings well. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 122/52 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on nasal cannula. She has a history of erythromycin allergy and was last given cefepime on [**2146-12-14**] 09:03 AM. She is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and prednisone. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is improving but remains chronically hypoxemic with multiple etiologies. There is a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure if BiPAP settings are not optimized or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or a respiratory infection.
2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of CAD and CHF, which puts her at risk for further cardiac complications such as congestive heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2."
