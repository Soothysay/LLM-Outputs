   60M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, COPD p/w severe hypertension and dyspnea
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   <I>## Dyspnea:</I>Differential dx includes COPD flare, pneumonia, ACS,
   CHF. No ischemic changes or elevations in cardiac enzymes, time course
   (progressive over 2 days) also atypical for ACS.  No fevers or
   leukocytosis, although pt is immunosuppressed, no focal infiltrate or
   increased sputum production to suggest pneumonia. Hypertension and
   acute on chronic renal failure leading to volume overload and pulmonary
   edema would fit well with this picture and would be c/w marked anterior
   wheeze, however his JVP is flat, his BNP is not elevated from 3 years
   ago, his CXR doesn't show clear volume overload and he has no crackles
   on exam.  His prolonged expiratory phase and known h/o COPD as well as
   hyperinflated lungs argue for a COPD flare.
   -Frequent nebs, trial of continuous neb mask.  Bicarb WNL, no evidence
   of chronic respiratory acidosis, if this is COPD flare it is acute,
   with no time for compensation.
   -Check ABG
   -Azithromycin x total 5 day course.
   -Prednisone burst, continue 60mg per day
   -check sputum cx,  urine legionella antigen
   -Consider repeat BiPap trial if nebs not effective

   nephropathy, had been on dialysis before CRT in [**2097**].  Reports
   adherence with immunosuppresants.  Unclear precipitant for ARF, ddx
   includes dehydration, although unlikely given hypertension; rejection,
   recurrence of hypertensive nephropathy in graft.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone a cardiac transplant. He presents with severe hypertension and dyspnea, and his vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate, as well as decreased oxygen saturation. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and CPAP/PSV ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, and BUN. His electrolytes show increased sodium and potassium levels. The troponin T level is within normal range. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals respiratory acidosis with a low carbon dioxide (CO2) level.

The patient's physical examination shows marked anterior wheeze but no crackles or other abnormalities. The peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, and there are no neurological deficits reported.

Based on the assessment, the patient's dyspnea is likely due to a COPD flare rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS), congestive heart failure (CHF), or pneumonia. The plan includes frequent nebulizers, a trial of continuous nebulizer mask, bicarbonate administration, and azithromycin for a total 5-day course. Prednisone burst therapy will be continued, along with checking ABG, sputum culture, and urine legionella antigen. BiPap trial and diures"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cardiac transplant (CRT), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe hypertension and dyspnea.

The patient's recent events include placement of a left percutaneous internal jugular central catheter (PICC), which ended in the brachiocephalic vein. The patient also had a nasopharyngeal swab positive for parainfluenza, with no evidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) based on normal LDH levels. Urine tests for Legionella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and BK virus are pending. The patient's troponin T levels have been within normal limits, indicating no acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 35.7°C (96.2°F) and current temperature (Tcurrent) of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate (HR) of 88 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 192/92 mmHg to 114/79 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2)"

   WHEEZING / RESP DISTRESS: likely mostly copd exac, possible from viral
   infection, vs mainly viral infection (given lack of prior frequent
   admits for copd exacerbation and normal pCO2):
   -will consider steroids back down to prednisone 5 daily (home dose)
   unless renal has concern for rejection and higher dose is recommended;
   -cont nebs; make ipratropium standing and continue albuterol standing
   and prn
   -no specific treatment for parainfluenza at this time
   -would benefit from cpap if able to tolerate but declining
   ANEMIA:
   -check iron panel
   ARF/TRANSPLANT: Cr remains elevated
   -fu final read on kidney and discuss with transplant additional imaging
   / tests
   -will avoid nephrotoxins and renal adjust meds
   HTN: can only check on leg; thus likely falsely elevated [**Location (un) 118**] in

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post kidney transplant, presenting with dyspnea and wheezing. He has tested positive for parainfluenza virus. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with high blood pressure and elevated creatinine levels indicating acute renal failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications, including sedatives, analgesics, antibiotics, and antihypertensives. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes, as well as decreased hemoglobin and sodium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's COPD and wheezing indicate a high risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute exacerbation of COPD.
2. Renal Complications: The elevated creatinine levels suggest ongoing renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury. This could potentially lead to further deterioration of renal function or require dialysis.
3. Infection: The positive parainfluenza virus test indicates a viral infection, which may worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's high blood pressure and history of hypertension put him at risk for cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction or heart failure.
5. Medication-related Complications: The patient is on"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension (htn), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), end-stage renal disease (esrd) post kidney transplant, presenting with dyspnea and wheezing. The patient has tested positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/74 to 206/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode set at a tidal volume of 730 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), glucose, and troponin-T, while other labs such as CK, CKMB, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, PT/PTT/INR, and electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral expiratory wheezes and mild tenderness throughout the abdomen. The patient's mental status is described as attentive and follows simple commands.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post kidney transplant (s/p kidney tx), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient presents with dyspnea and wheezing, and is positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and wheezing suggest an exacerbation of COPD, which can be triggered by viral infections like parainfluenza.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia could progress to ARDS, a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of right mid lung zone opacity on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia, which can be caused by viral or bacterial infections.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of HTN and ESRD puts him at risk for cardiac complications, such as acute heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate ongoing renal impairment, which can be exacerbated by factors like medication toxicity or infection.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobility and risk factors (such as HTN and E"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone a renal transplant. 
- He is experiencing severe hypertension and dyspnea, which may be due to underlying COPD with possible exacerbation in the setting of parainfluenza infection, as well as a component of congestive heart failure (CHF). Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been ruled out.
- The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adherence, and he has a history of difficult-to-control hypertension with hypertensive nephropathy/ESRD post-transplant.
- He is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), with unclear precipitants. Dehydration and transplant nephropathy are possible causes. No evidence of renal artery stenosis (RAS) on renal ultrasound. Tacrolimus level is within normal range, and BK virus DNA is not detected.
- The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia, likely secondary to a lung process such as SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion). Fluid restriction is recommended.
- He has hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus, for which appropriate management plans are in place.
- The patient has chronic pain, GERD, and constipation, with ongoing management strategies.
- His nutrition and glycemic control are being monitored and managed accordingly.

   worsening in respiratory status.
   1)Respiratory Failure-_Persistent and signficant wheezes seen and worse
   than yesterday.
   -Recemic epi
   -Will increase steroid dosing given worsening from yesterday if durable
   response not seen from yesterday
   -Will need to move to intubation if clinical improvement not seen with
   epinephrine
   -With intubation will move to bronch and CT with evaluation needed
   -CXR this morning
   -Concerning worsening across time in regards to continued distress,
   limited capacity to perform further investigations.
   -He has worsening HCO3- and will need to evaluate for evidence of
   lactic acidosis which may result from respiratory distress
which would
   be a n indicator for need for intubation and support
   -Need to achieve adequate stability for CT scan to evaluate airway
   lesions further
   2)Hypertension-
   -Continue BP control with multiple medications and look to wean off of
   IV support
   3)Renal Failure--S/P Transplant-
   -Continue with renal support
   -no change in medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with significant respiratory distress. The likely trigger for the respiratory failure is parainfluenza, as seen on viral screen. The patient's condition has shown slow improvement but with persistent wheezes noted. The respiratory status has not clearly worsened despite the weaning of steroid doses. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent wheezes and worsening respiratory distress indicate ongoing respiratory failure. If the clinical improvement is not seen with epinephrine, intubation may be necessary. Further investigations such as bronchoscopy and CT scan will be required to evaluate airway lesions.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled with multiple medications and weaned off IV support.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function requires continued support, and no changes in medications are recommended.
4. Possible Lactic Acidosis: The patient's worsening bicarbonate levels indicate a potential for lactic acidosis resulting from respiratory distress. Intubation and support may be needed if evidence of lactic acidosis is present.
5. Airway Lesions: Adequate stability is required for a CT scan to evaluate further airway lesions.
6. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a cardiac transplant. He presents with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 140/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is sedated but responsive to voice commands.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium (K+), indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is not provided. The complete blood count (CBC) shows a normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet count (Plt).

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis. His serum electrolytes are abnormal, with hyponatremia (Na+), hyperkalemia (K+), hypocalcemia (Ca++), and hypomagnesemia (Mg++). The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows grossly clear lungs with mild emphysema. The endotracheal tube (ETT) is appropriately"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a cardiac transplant (CRT) and has been on immunosuppressants.
- He presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress.
- The patient's underlying conditions include COPD, possible exacerbation of CHF, and hypertension.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with normal oxygenation and ventilation.
- Laboratory results show elevated creatinine and BUN levels, indicating renal impairment.
- The patient has hyponatremia, which may be secondary to SIADH.
- He also has hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic pain, GERD, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial presentation of severe dyspnea and subsequent intubation indicate respiratory distress. This could be due to exacerbation of COPD or possible component of CHF.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's history of ESRD and recent CRT suggest a predisposition to renal complications. The elevated creatinine and BUN levels, along with feNa of 1.4, indicate ARF. Dehydration, transplant nephropathy, and rejection are possible causes.
3. Hypertension: The patient has known difficult-to-control hypertension, which has contributed to hypertensive nephropathy/ESRD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a combined heart and lung transplant. He presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress. The patient has a history of COPD, hypertension, and ESRD. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 140/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is sedated but responsive, with faint scattered expiratory wheezes noted on pulmonary examination. Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2, and no edema is present. The patient has a soft and non-tender abdomen, non-functional right upper extremity (UE) fistula, and multiple keloids on his skin. Neurological examination shows sedation but movement of all extremities. 

Laboratory findings indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, and glucose levels. Other lab results show normal liver function tests, electrolyte imbalances, and troponin-T levels. Imaging studies reveal no significant underlying pulmonary disease or airway obstruction.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary issues include severe respiratory distress and fatigue requiring intubation, underlying COPD exacerbation, possible"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a kidney transplant. He presents with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 140/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support. The patient is sedated and intubated.

The physical examination reveals diffuse wheezes bilaterally, no crackles or rhonchi, prolonged expiratory phase, and no edema. The abdomen shows bowel sounds present throughout, with no tenderness due to the patient's uncooperativeness. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented x 3.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. Other lab values indicate possible signs of infection, electrolyte imbalances, and renal dysfunction.

   60 yo male with history of ESRD and s/p renal transplant now with
   intubation in the setting of progressive respiratory
   distress--tachypnea, weezing not responseive to racemic epinephrine or
   albuterol.  Following intubation patient with persistent and
   significant expiratory flow limitation and CT scan not showing
   prominent abnormality.  This leaves possible ongoing trigger for
   persistent bronchospasm or allergic reaction/anaphylaxis or TBM
   potentially driving findings which is one which has persisted despite
   high dose of steroids.
   What we are left with now is a need to explain possible sources as best
   as they can be defined.  For Bronchomalacia
certainly with the forced
   exhalations he is undertaking this may promote collapse which will
   overwhelm the effects of PEEP.  Will need to paralyze
if paralytics
   used and expiratory airflow back to normal with PEEP this would argue
   for central airway.  Alternatively parooxyms may be
   allergen/anaphylactic triggered (Cymbalta, insulin, heparin, cellcept,
   colace, methylpred, lansoprazole all given before most recent
   paroxysm), alternatively patient does have infecitous insult as
   possible trigger with course made worse or prolonged in the setting of
   immunosupression.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Complex picture described above to be evaluated
   by the following interventions
   -Will send tryptase
   -Will pursue paralysis on ventilator to evaluate response to PEEP of
   obstruction
   -Will minimize medications
   -Continue PSV
   -Solumedrol 125mg tid had no meaningful improvement and will move to
   off in the setting of ongoing infection
   -Azithro completed
   -Will review Cymbalta as possible contributor
   3)Chronic and Acute Renal Failure-
   -Tacrolimus, Mycophenilate, Solumedrol as above
will return to baseline
   steroid dosing or steroid dosing indicated by concern for rejection on
   renal team
s part.
   -Will need to follow up on U/S final conclusions and need for biopsy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a subsequent renal transplant. He is currently intubated in the ICU due to progressive respiratory distress, characterized by tachypnea and wheezing. The patient did not respond to racemic epinephrine or albuterol. A CT scan showed clear lungs with no airway abnormalities or infiltrates, only small areas of emphysema. The patient's condition remains unexplained, with possible ongoing triggers for bronchospasm, allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's complex respiratory condition requires further evaluation and intervention. The physician plans to pursue paralysis on the ventilator to assess the response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), minimize medications, continue pressure support ventilation (PSV), and administer a higher dose of steroids.
2. Chronic and Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring. The physician plans to adjust immunosuppressive medications and follow up on ultrasound (U/S) results to determine if a renal biopsy is necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which requires ongoing management.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a pre-existing diagnosis of COPD, which may contribute to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension (HTN), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress. The assessment suggests that the dyspnea may be due to an underlying COPD exacerbation with a possible component of CHF, but airway obstruction has been ruled out.

The patient's medical complications include acute renal failure (ARF), hyponatremia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and constipation. The ARF may be secondary to hypertensive nephropathy or transplant nephropathy, with a possibility of rejection. The hyponatremia is suspected to be caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) due to a pulmonary process.

The plan includes continuing frequent bronchodilator therapy, azithromycin for a total of 5 days, discontinuing steroids, and conducting further investigations such as a micro data follow-up and renal biopsy. Fluid boluses are being given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and the patient is being held on [Last Name (un)] due to ARF"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) procedure. He has a history of severe hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is currently intubated for progressive respiratory distress. The patient's medical history also includes heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, chronic pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and constipation.

From the assessment, the patient's dyspnea is attributed to underlying COPD with possible exacerbation due to parainfluenza infection, as well as a component of congestive heart failure (CHF). Airway obstruction has been ruled out through a CT scan. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure ranging from 107/67 mmHg to 155/92 mmHg. His respiratory rate is set at 10 breaths per minute with spontaneous rate of 18 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 98% on a FiO2 of 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), with decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia (Na+), hyperkalemia (K+), and hypocalcemia (Ca++). Renal function tests reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5,093 mL and output of 1,060 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a positive balance of 4,033 mL. The respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 650 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory distress due to COPD exacerbation or pulmonary infection.
2. Hypotension and fluid overload due to renal failure and hypertension.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF) possibly caused by dehydration, transplant nephropathy, or rejection.
4. Hyponatremia potentially secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
5. Hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus requiring ongoing management.
6. Chronic pain management considering the patient's history of gabapentin use.
7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
8. Constipation management with laxatives.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, renal function, electrolyte levels, and overall response to treatment. Regular communication with the healthcare team and appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan will be necessary to address these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and has a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea and was intubated for progressive respiratory distress. The patient has several medical conditions, including possible exacerbation of COPD, hypertension, acute renal failure (ARF), hyponatremia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107 to 155 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient is sedated and intubated.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) procedure. He presents with severe hypertension and dyspnea and was intubated for progressive respiratory distress. The patient's medical history includes COPD, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.

From the assessment and plan section of the progress note, it appears that the patient has several medical complications that require attention. These include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient required intubation due to progressive respiratory distress, which was initially thought to be related to an exacerbation of COPD with a possible component of congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the CT scan ruled out significant pulmonary disease, and the ventilator mode has been changed to CPAP/PSV. The patient's ABGs are now consistent with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Hypertension: The patient has known difficult-to-control hypertension, which has led to hypertensive nephropathy/ESRD. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, dropping post-intubation and requiring fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of ESRD due to hypertensive nephropathy. He was on dialysis before the CRT procedure. The recent renal function tests show an elevated creatinine level and a high fractional"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo man with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, COPD p/w severe hypertension and
   dyspnea, now intubated for progressive respiratory distress.
   # Dyspnea: Underlying COPD with possible exacerbation in setting of
   parainfluenza, also with ?component of CHF. Ruled out for ACS.
   Progressive respiratory distress and fatigue required intubation on
   [**6-5**]. ABGs now consistent with adequate oxygenation and ventilation. CT
   scan without significant pulm dz and vent physiology most consistent
   with small airways obstruction, bronchospasm. I:E ratio improving with
   decreased wheezes on exam but not candidate for extubation today
   -Continue frequent bronchodilator therapy with albuterol and atrovent
   -Azithromycin 5-day course completed yesterday
   -Discontinued high-dose steroids yesterday dose (d/t lack of benefit x
   three days) and restarted on usual renal transplant prednisone
   -F/u micro data
   -RSBI/SBT tomorrow
   # Volatile blood pressure: Has known difficult to control HTN, with
   hypertensive nephropathy/ESRD s/p transplant.  Reports med adherence.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to respiratory distress, HD steroids, narcotic withdrawal,
   renal failure, volume overload. No evidence of RAS on renal US.  Had
   been on hydral 75mg q6H, clonidine 0.1mg PO TID, Amlodipine 10mg daily,
   and Nicardipine gtt; however, post-intubation his blood pressure
   dropped and he has since required fluid boluses to maintain MAP >65.
   Now BP increasing again, ?in setting of inadequate pain control with
   poor gastric motility.
   -Start fentanyl gtt as may not be absorbing po pain meds

   exacerbated by narcotics and has not had bowel mvt in [**5-4**] days.
   -KUB to evaluate for ileus
   -Reglan

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cardiac transplant, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress. The patient's ABGs indicate adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and a CT scan rules out significant pulmonary disease. Ventilation physiology suggests small airway obstruction and bronchospasm. The patient has completed a 5-day course of azithromycin, discontinued high-dose steroids, and restarted on usual renal transplant prednisone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying COPD with possible exacerbation in the setting of parainfluenza and/or component of congestive heart failure (CHF) may lead to further respiratory distress. The patient requires frequent bronchodilator therapy with albuterol and atrovent, and RSBI/SBT will be performed tomorrow.
2. Hypertension: The patient has known difficult-to-control hypertension, with hypertensive nephropathy/ESRD post-transplant. His blood pressure is currently increasing, possibly due to inadequate pain control and poor gastric motility. Fentanyl gtt has been started, and hydral prn or nicardipine gtt may be considered if persistently elevated BP persists.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's history of ESR"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   60 yo male with history of ESRD and s/p renal transplant now with
   intubation in the setting of progressive respiratory
   distress--tachypnea, weezing not responseive to racemic epinephrine or
   albuterol.  Following intubation patient with persistent and
   significant expiratory flow limitation and CT scan not showing
   prominent abnormality.  This leaves possible ongoing trigger for
   persistent bronchospasm or allergic reaction/anaphylaxis or TBM
   potentially driving findings which is one which has persisted despite
   high dose of steroids.
   What we are left with now is a need to explain possible sources as best
   as they can be defined.  For Bronchomalacia
certainly with the forced
   exhalations he is undertaking this may promote collapse which will
   overwhelm the effects of PEEP.  Will need to paralyze
if paralytics
   used and expiratory airflow back to normal with PEEP this would argue
   for central airway.  Alternatively parooxyms may be
   allergen/anaphylactic triggered (Cymbalta, insulin, heparin, cellcept,
   colace, methylpred, lansoprazole all given before most recent
   paroxysm), alternatively patient does have infectious insult as
   possible trigger with course made worse or prolonged in the setting of
   immunosupression.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure
   -Will send tryptase
   -minimize medications
   -Continue PSV
   -Off high dose steroids
   -Azithro completed, off Cymbalta empirically to eliminate possible
   causes though unlikely
   2) Chronic and Acute Renal Failure-
   -Tacrolimus, Mycophenilate, usual prednisone as above
will return to
   baseline steroid dosing or steroid dosing indicated by concern for
   rejection on renal team
s part.
   -Will need to follow up on renal biopsy.
   3) DM
   4) Nutrition
 assume no PO meds being absorbed. Will change PO to IV
   meds.
   - gastroparesis by study in [**2101**], likely related to DM.
   - trial of Reglan, if not successful, will insert post-pyloric dobhoff.
   Consider TPN if necessary.
   5) Constipation
   - bowel regimen
   - check KUB

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. He has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has undergone a renal transplant. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He is also receiving sedation and paralysis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 144/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and potassium levels. The patient's imaging shows an endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in good position, with no new infiltrates seen on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current medical conditions include renal failure, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to bronchospasm, possibly due to bronchomalacia or an allergic reaction/anaphylaxis. 

The plan includes continuing pressure support ventilation (PSV), minimizing medications, sending tryptase levels, and conducting further investigations to"

   60 yo man with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, COPD p/w severe hypertension and
   dyspnea, now intubated for progressive respiratory distress.
   # Dyspnea: Underlying COPD with possible exacerbation in setting of
   parainfluenza, also with ?component of CHF. Ruled out for ACS.
   Progressive respiratory distress and fatigue required intubation on
   [**6-5**]. ABGs now consistent with adequate oxygenation and ventilation. CT
   scan without significant pulm dz and vent physiology most consistent
   with small airways obstruction, bronchospasm. I:E ratio improving with
   decreased wheezes on exam but not candidate for extubation today
   -Continue frequent bronchodilator therapy with albuterol and atrovent
   -Azithromycin 5-day course completed yesterday
   -Discontinued high-dose steroids yesterday dose (d/t lack of benefit x
   three days) and restarted on usual renal transplant prednisone
   -F/u micro data
   -RSBI/SBT tomorrow
   # Volatile blood pressure: Has known difficult to control HTN, with
   hypertensive nephropathy/ESRD s/p transplant.  Reports med adherence.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to respiratory distress, HD steroids, narcotic withdrawal,
   renal failure, volume overload. No evidence of RAS on renal US.  Had
   been on hydral 75mg q6H, clonidine 0.1mg PO TID, Amlodipine 10mg daily,
   and Nicardipine gtt; however, post-intubation his blood pressure
   dropped and he has since required fluid boluses to maintain MAP >65.
   Now BP increasing again, ?in setting of inadequate pain control with
   poor gastric motility.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a combined heart-lung transplant (CRT). He presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation due to progressive respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which may have exacerbated his respiratory symptoms. Initial ABGs showed adequate oxygenation and ventilation. A CT scan revealed no significant pulmonary disease, and the patient's respiratory physiology is consistent with small airways obstruction and bronchospasm. The patient has been weaned off high-dose steroids and restarted on usual renal transplant prednisone. He is currently being treated with bronchodilator therapy and azithromycin.

The patient also has uncontrolled hypertension, which is a known complication of his ESRD. He has been on multiple antihypertensive medications, but his blood pressure remains elevated. The recent drop in blood pressure after intubation suggests a possible association with respiratory distress and narcotic withdrawal. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with elevated creatinine levels and signs of acute renal failure (ARF). A renal biopsy is pending to determine the cause. Tacrolimus levels are within normal range, and there is no evidence of BK virus DNA.

Other medical issues include decreased gastric motility, likely exacerbated by narcotics and poor gastric emptying. The patient has a history of impaired gastric emptying and diabetes mell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a kidney transplant (CRT) and is currently in the ICU. He has a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation due to progressive respiratory distress. His ABGs indicate adequate oxygenation and ventilation, but he remains a poor candidate for extubation. He has multiple medical complications, including ARF, decreased gastric motility, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's current medications include fentanyl gtt, hydralazine, clonidine, amlodipine, nicardipine gtt, tacrolimus, cellcept, prograf, and a PPI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volatile blood pressure: The patient has known difficult-to-control hypertension, which can be exacerbated by renal failure and volume overload. His current medications include hydralazine, clonidine, amlodipine, and nicardipine gtt. Frequent monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications will be necessary to maintain blood pressure within target range.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a history of ESRD due to hypertensive nephropathy. He is currently experiencing ARF, and the cause is unclear. Dehydration, transplant nephropathy, and"

   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   60 yo male with history of ESRD and s/p renal transplant now with
   intubation in the setting of progressive respiratory
   distress--tachypnea, weezing not responseive to racemic epinephrine or
   albuterol.  Following intubation patient with persistent and
   significant expiratory flow limitation and CT scan not showing
   prominent abnormality.  This leaves possible ongoing trigger for
   persistent bronchospasm or allergic reaction/anaphylaxis or TBM
   potentially driving findings which is one which has persisted despite
   high dose of steroids.
   What we are left with now is a need to explain possible sources as best
   as they can be defined.  For Bronchomalacia
certainly with the forced
   exhalations he is undertaking this may promote collapse which will
   overwhelm the effects of PEEP.  Will need to paralyze
if paralytics
   used and expiratory airflow back to normal with PEEP this would argue
   for central airway.  Alternatively parooxyms may be
   allergen/anaphylactic triggered (Cymbalta, insulin, heparin, cellcept,
   colace, methylpred, lansoprazole all given before most recent
   paroxysm), alternatively patient does have infectious insult as
   possible trigger with course made worse or prolonged in the setting of
   immunosupression.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure
   -minimize medications
   -Continue PSV --> SBT today, may be ready to extubate
   -Off high dose steroids, on Flovent MDI only, bronchospasm much
   improved
   -Azithro completed, off Cymbalta empirically to eliminate possible
   causes though unlikely
   - f/u on echo report
   2) Leukocytosis with 4% bands
   Concern for brewing infection, VAP but no infiltrate on CXR, no fever
   3) Chronic and Acute Renal Failure-
   -Tacrolimus, Mycophenilate, usual prednisone now dex IV
   -Will need to follow up on renal biopsy.
   3) DM
   4) Nutrition
 high residuals are improving.
   - gastroparesis by study in [**2101**], likely related to DM.
   - continue trial of Reglan, if not successful, will insert post-pyloric

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a renal transplant. He is currently intubated due to progressive respiratory distress, tachypnea, and wheezing unresponsive to racemic epinephrine or albuterol. The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation. His condition persists despite high-dose steroids, suggesting a potential ongoing trigger for bronchospasm or allergic reaction/anaphylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, and efforts are being made to minimize medications and wean him off the ventilator. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is being provided, and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) will be conducted today to assess readiness for extubation.
2. Leukocytosis with 4% bands: There is a concern for brewing infection, possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Although there are no infiltrates on the chest X-ray and no fever, leukocytosis with 4% bands indicates a possible ongoing infection.
3. Chronic and Acute Renal Failure: The patient has chronic and acute renal failure, which requires ongoing management. Tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and usual prednisone are being administered, and a renal biopsy will be followed up on.

   60 yo man with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, COPD p/w severe hypertension and
   dyspnea, now intubated for progressive respiratory distress.
   # Hypotension:  After being extremely hypertensive for several days, he
   became hypotensive overnight, not responsive to IVF and requiring the
   initiation of presors.  Most likely secondary to sepsis given low CVP,
   CXR with infiltrate, and GNR in sputum.   Also there is some concern
   for adrenal insufficiency, although he is currently on stress-dose
   steroids.  CVP is low, so cardiogenic shock is less likely.  Volume
   depletion may also be at play.  Given abdominal distention there is
   also some concern for abdominal compartement syndrome.
   - continue pressure support with vasopressin, phenylephrine, levophed
   - attempt to wean levophed as tolerated to maintain MAP >60
   - f/u echo for potential cardiac cause
   - continue stress-dose steroids
   - continue vanc/zosyn for likely pulmonary source of infection
   - repeat stool for c diff
   - check bladder pressure
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to underlying COPD with
   reactive airway disease possibly worsened by parainfluenza causing
   small airway spasm.  CT did not show any significant parenchymal
   disease.  On exam he is not moving air well.   ABGs show respiratory
   acidosis with adequate oxygenation
   - wean FiO2 to 60%
   - decrease RR and increase TV to try to improve ventilation
   - continue MDI as needed
   -
   # Acute renal failure:  History of ESRD [**3-3**] hypertensive nephropathy,
   now s/p CRT.  Creatinine improving now, but low UOP with metabolic
   acidosis.  Had bx, results pending but likely not rejection.  Most
   likely cause of current renal failure is pre-renal secondary to
   hypotension.
   - f/u renal recs
   - await bx results
   - bicarbonate in fluids
   - minimize NS (will change meds to D5 solution as much as possible)
   - discuss with renal if CVVH may be indicated for volume removal.
   - continue steroids, cellcept, prograf for immunosuppresion
   # Abdominal distention: High residuals from tube feeds. H/o poor
   motility on prior gastric emptying study, may be [**3-3**] DM. Likely also
   exacerbated by narcotics and has not had bowel mvt in [**5-4**] days.
   - continue Reglan
   - check bladder pressure
   - may need placement of post-pyloric dobhoff for nutrition if not
   improving
   - repeat KUB
   # Abnormal TFTs:  not consistent with sick euthyroid, low TSH indicates
   possible central process
   - discuss with endocrine
   - consider thyroid hormone replacement

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent continuous renal replacement therapy (CRT) and has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). 

The patient presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress. Subsequently, he developed hypotension, which was not responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF) and required the initiation of vasopressors. This hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis, as evidenced by low central venous pressure (CVP), infiltrate on chest X-ray (CXR), and gram-negative rods (GNR) in sputum. There is also concern for adrenal insufficiency, although the patient is currently on stress-dose steroids. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to underlying COPD with reactive airway disease, possibly worsened by parainfluenza causing small airway spasm. The ABGs show respiratory acidosis with adequate oxygenation. 

The patient has acute renal failure, with a history of ESRD hypertensive nephropathy, now post-CRT. Creatinine is improving, but low urine output (UOP) with metabolic acidosis indicates pre-renal azotemia secondary to hypotension. 

Abdominal distention is caused by high residuals from"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure overnight, which was not responsive to fluid boluses and required the initiation of pressors. This could be due to sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or volume depletion.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe respiratory distress led to intubation. This may be secondary to underlying COPD with reactive airway disease, possibly worsened by parainfluenza causing small airway spasm.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and hypertensive nephropathy, now complicated by CRT. Creatinine levels are improving, but there is concern for pre-renal secondary to hypotension.

4. Abdominal distention: The patient has high residuals from tube feeds and a history of poor motility. This could be exacerbated by narcotics and lack of bowel movement.

5. Abnormal thyroid function tests: The patient has abnormal TFTs, which may indicate a central process.

6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient requires management for hyperlipidemia.

7. Diabetes: The patient needs to be monitored and managed for diabetes.

8. Chronic pain: The patient requires pain management, particularly since they are unable to take oral pain medications due to poor gastric motility.

9. GERD: The patient requires treatment for GERD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after a kidney transplant, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to progressive respiratory distress and fatigue. There is a possibility of acute exacerbation of COPD and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD due to hypertensive nephropathy and was on dialysis before the kidney transplant. He is now experiencing acute renal failure, which could be caused by various factors including dehydration, transplant nephropathy, or rejection. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

3. Hypertension: The patient has known difficult-to-control hypertension, which contributes to hypertensive nephropathy/ESRD. Blood pressure control is crucial to prevent further complications such as stroke or cardiac events.

4. Constipation: The patient has decreased gastric motility, leading to high residuals from tube feeds. This could be exacerbated by narcotics and may require aggressive bowel regimen and possibly placement of a post-pyloric Dobhoff for nutrition if not improving.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-corticosteroid therapy, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea, leading to intubation for progressive respiratory distress. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, respiratory failure, constipation, acute renal failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. 

1. Hypotension: The patient's low central venous pressure (CVP), chest X-ray with infiltrate, and presence of Gram-negative rods in sputum suggest sepsis as the likely cause of hypotension. There is also concern for adrenal insufficiency, but the patient is currently on stress-dose steroids. 

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD may have worsened due to an exacerbation in the setting of parainfluenza infection. This could be accompanied by a component of congestive heart failure (CHF). 

3. Constipation: The patient has a history of poor gastric motility, which may be exacerbated by narcotics and has not had bowel movement in five days. 

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's history of ESRD due to hypertensive nephropathy and recent renal transplant raises suspicion for transplant nephropathy or rejection. 

5. Hyponatremia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a kidney transplant. He presents with severe hypertension, dyspnea, and progressive respiratory distress, leading to intubation. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), constipation, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has low CVP and a chest X-ray showing infiltrate, indicating possible sepsis. There is also a concern for adrenal insufficiency, although he is currently on stress-dose steroids. The low CVP suggests that cardiogenic shock is less likely, but volume depletion may be contributing to the hypotension.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD may be exacerbated by a viral infection, possibly parainfluenza, and there is a question of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's ABGs indicate adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The CT scan shows small airways obstruction and bronchospasm. The patient is not a candidate for extubation at this time.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD due to hypertensive nephropathy and was previously on dialysis. His FeNa is 1.4, indicating reduced renal function. The cause of the acute renal failure is"

   60 yo man with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, COPD p/w severe hypertension and
   dyspnea, now intubated for progressive respiratory distress.
   # Hypotension:  After being extremely hypertensive for several days, he
   became hypotensive overnight, not responsive to IVF and requiring the
   initiation of presors.  Most likely secondary to sepsis given low CVP,
   CXR with infiltrate, and GNR in sputum.   Also there is some concern
   for adrenal insufficiency, although he is currently on stress-dose
   steroids.  CVP is low, so cardiogenic shock is less likely.  Volume
   depletion may also be at play.  Given abdominal distention there is
   also some concern for abdominal compartement syndrome.
   - continue pressure support with vasopressin, phenylephrine, levophed
   - attempt to wean levophed as tolerated to maintain MAP >60
   - f/u echo for potential cardiac cause
   - continue stress-dose steroids
   - continue vanc/zosyn for likely pulmonary source of infection
   - repeat stool for c diff
   - check bladder pressure
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to underlying COPD with
   reactive airway disease possibly worsened by parainfluenza causing
   small airway spasm.  CT did not show any significant parenchymal
   disease.  On exam he is not moving air well.   ABGs show respiratory
   acidosis with adequate oxygenation
   - wean FiO2 to 60%
   - decrease RR and increase TV to try to improve ventilation
   - continue MDI as needed
   -
   # Acute renal failure:  History of ESRD [**3-3**] hypertensive nephropathy,
   now s/p CRT.  Creatinine improving now, but low UOP with metabolic
   acidosis.  Had bx, results pending but likely not rejection.  Most
   likely cause of current renal failure is pre-renal secondary to
   hypotension.
   - f/u renal recs
   - await bx results
   - bicarbonate in fluids
   - minimize NS (will change meds to D5 solution as much as possible)
   - discuss with renal if CVVH may be indicated for volume removal.
   - continue steroids, cellcept, prograf for immunosuppresion
   # Abdominal distention: High residuals from tube feeds. H/o poor
   motility on prior gastric emptying study, may be [**3-3**] DM. Likely also
   exacerbated by narcotics and has not had bowel mvt in [**5-4**] days.
   - continue Reglan
   - check bladder pressure
   - may need placement of post-pyloric dobhoff for nutrition if not
   improving
   - repeat KUB
   # Abnormal TFTs:  not consistent with sick euthyroid, low TSH indicates
   possible central process

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with severe hypertension and dyspnea. He is intubated for progressive respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

24-hour events:
- Multi-lumen catheter and triple introducer placed.
- Renal function test showed elevated creatinine levels.
- The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which was unresponsive to intravenous fluids and required the initiation of vasopressors. The low central venous pressure (CVP), chest X-ray with infiltrate, and presence of Gram-negative rods (GNR) in sputum suggest sepsis as the likely cause. There is also concern for adrenal insufficiency, although the patient is currently receiving stress-dose steroids.
- The patient's blood pressure is being supported with vasopressin and phenylephrine. An attempt is being made to wean levophed as tolerated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. An echocardiogram is planned to evaluate for potential cardiac causes of hypotension.
- Stress-dose steroids are being continued, and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam are being administered for likely pulmonary infection.
- A stool culture for Clostridium difficile (C."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of COPD and immunosuppression due to a renal transplant. He was admitted with progressive respiratory distress requiring intubation, tachypnea, wheezing, and minimal response to racemic epinephrine, albuterol, and high-dose steroids. The patient is also positive for parainfluenza, significant expiratory limitation, and ventilatory defect concerning for possible TBM or small airways reactivity. He developed progressive hypotension overnight and is now on three pressors for HD support. The patient has severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis, acute renal failure on CRI, leukocytosis, and GNR in sputum.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's worsening condition with GNR sputum and progressive infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The presence of bilateral lower zone infiltrates and worsening respiratory failure with metabolic and respiratory acidosis raises concern for ARDS, a severe lung condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the alveoli.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of COPD, who underwent a renal transplant. He was admitted with progressive respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, and constipation. He is currently on triple pressors for hypotension and receiving treatment for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's prognosis is poor due to multiorgan system involvement and progressive decline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/VAP: The patient's hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, and GNR in sputum suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis and VAP.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The presence of bilateral lower lung infiltrates and worsening oxygenation may indicate ARDS.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and low cortisol levels, adrenal insufficiency could be a contributing factor to the hypotension.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreasing urine output suggest acute renal failure.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may require ongoing management.
6. Constipation: The patient has been experiencing constipation, likely due to immobility and medications.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and parainfluenza infection may indicate pneumonia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of esrd post transplant, copd, htn, who is currently in the ICU due to progressive respiratory failure, hypotension, and acute renal failure on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI). The patient has been diagnosed with parainfluenza infection and has developed bilateral lower zone infiltrates with gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum. The patient is receiving aggressive intravenous fluid support, triple pressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to underlying copd with small airways disease, worsened by the parainfluenza infection and development of bilateral lower zone infiltrates. The patient's ventilation is worsening, with increased minute ventilation and respiratory acidosis. The plan is to try matching positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), decrease the rate, and increase tidal volume (TV) slightly to improve the patient's ventilation.

The patient's acute renal failure on CRI is associated with decreased urine output. The plan is to give bicarbonate and monitor renal function closely, considering the need for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) if necessary.

The patient also has abdominal distension, and it is planned to check bladder pressure,"
