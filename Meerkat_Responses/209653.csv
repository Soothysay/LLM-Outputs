   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with history of recurrent multiple myeloma now s/p cord
   blood transplant with complicated hospital course was admitted with
   hypoxia and bacteremia.
   1. Hypoxia
   Etiology of patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial but has several
   possible causes. Differential includes infectious etiology including
   [**Hospital 1836**] [**Name10 (NameIs) 1837**] pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, or viral
   pneumonia/ pneumonitis such as influenza or CMV. No history of
   aspiration event in this patient.  Additional infectious etiologies
   include opportunistic infections such as PCP given patient's
   immunocompromised state from malignancy and immunosuppressive meds
   (steroids, cyclosporine, and mycophenylate mofetil) or acute lung
   injury secondary to gram positive bacteremia. Pulmonary edema secondary
   to CHF or secondary to multiple transfusions is another possibility,
   although asymmetric infiltrates would be atypical. Likewise, symptoms
   appear gradual in onset and not related to a specific transfusion or
   receipt of blood product. Additional possibilities include diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage given thrombocytopenia or respiratory distress
   secondary to drug effects. Most of his meds are not known to commonly
   cause respiratory side effects, although cyclosporine induced lung
   distress is one possibility.   Inflammatory lung disease such as
   sarcoidosis, Wegener
s, Goodpasture
s, or Lupus appears less likely
   given that patient has been on steroids. Graft versus host disease does
   not generally cause hypoxic respiratory distress as this patient has.
   This worsening of his symptoms is likely all worsened by patient's
   evidence of baseline emphysematous changes on CT scan.
   - bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis
   - send bronchoscopy for gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, PCP
   smear, DFA for viral panel, viral culture, Cryptococcal Ag, and
   cytology for CMV
   - start broad spectrum antibiotics presumptively for treatment of
   hospital acquired pneumonia, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] atypical pneumonia
   --> vancomycin to cover MRSA
   --> cefepime to cover pseudomonas
   --> azithromycin to cover atypicals
   --> bactrim to cover PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 400mg IV q8h
   --> consider adding antifungals if hypoxia persists
   - titrate antibiotics pending bronchoscopy results
   - will also check serum cryptoAg and urine legionella
   - check serum for toxo serology
   - for evaluation of CHF, check BNP and echo
   - would not make any medication changes unless symptoms persist or
   worsen, also would not make any changes as med effects appears unlikely
   - transfuse platelets for plt > 50
   - check ABG
   - continue standing ipratropium and albuterol nebs standing
   2. Bacteremia
   Patient with gram positive cocci in pairs and chains on blood culture.
   Potential pathogens include strep pneumo, enterococcus, or possibly
   oral flora such as peptostreptococcus or strep viridans.
   -         will continue vancomycin for now
   -          will follow-up with ID regarding need to broaden coverage to
   linezolid to cover VRE
   -          check echo
   -          will keep hickman in place for now; if patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable, will need to pull lines and gain central
   access
   3. Graft versus Host Disease
   Patient with persistent GvHD with overall rising bilirubin.
   - continue ursodiol
   - continue cyclosporine, etanercept, mycophenolate mofetil, and
   methylprednisolone
   - check cyclosporine level in the AM
   - appreciate BMT recs
   4. CMV Viremia
   Patient with history of CMV viremia.
   - continue ganciclovir
   - follow-up CMV level
   - continue enterocort for gut inflammation
   5. Multiple myeloma s/p Cord Tranplant:
   Continue management per BMT team.
   - monitor cell counts
   - continue cellcept, steroids, and cyclosporine
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - check daily cyclosporine levels
   - continue caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis; will follow-up with BMT
   regarding the need to continue this medication
   6. Acute Renal Failure
   Patient with baseline Cr 1.6-1.8 and now rising to 2.5. Etiology is
   likely multifactorial, including tacolimus and cyclosporine toxicity
   and dehydration.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid further nephrotoxic agents
   - check urine lytes
   - consider renal US
   7. Hypertension:
   Normotensive currently.
   - will continue anti-HTN meds for now with labetalol and amlodipine
   - will increase holding parameters given patient's risk for hypotension
   secondary to sepsis in light of positive blood cultures
   8. Duodenitis
   Duodenitis seen on EGD.
   - continue PPI
   9. Diabetes
   Hyperglycemic with steroids
   - Continue humalog insulin sliding scale with insulin in TPN
   10. Chronic Pain
   Stable
   - continue MS Contin with morphine for prn pain

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxia and bacteremia. The patient's hypoxia has several possible causes, including infectious etiologies such as pneumonia or viral pneumonia, acute lung injury secondary to gram-positive bacteremia, pulmonary edema secondary to CHF or multiple transfusions, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or respiratory distress secondary to drug effects. Bronchoscopy and tissue diagnosis are planned to further investigate the cause of hypoxia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial with possible causes including infectious etiologies, acute lung injury, pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or respiratory distress secondary to drug effects. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started presumptively for hospital-acquired pneumonia, PCP, and atypical pneumonia. Bronchoscopy with tissue diagnosis and additional cultures is planned.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains on blood culture, suggesting possible pathogens like strep pneumo, enterococcus, or oral flora. Vancomycin has been continued, and the need to broaden coverage to linezolid for VRE is being considered.
3. Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD): The patient has persistent GvHD with rising bilirubin. Ursodiol and cyclo"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with history of recurrent multiple myeloma now s/p cord
   blood transplant with complicated hospital course was admitted with
   hypoxia and bacteremia, with respiratory failure now intubated and
   vented.
   1. Hypoxia
   Etiology of patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial but has several
   possible causes. Differential includes infectious etiology including
   [**Hospital 1836**] [**Name10 (NameIs) 1837**] pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, or viral
   pneumonia/ pneumonitis such as influenza or CMV. aspiration event
   unlikely. Additional infectious etiologies include opportunistic
   infections such as PCP given patient's immunocompromised state from
   malignancy and immunosuppressive meds (steroids, cyclosporine, and
   mycophenylate mofetil) or acute lung injury secondary to gram positive
   bacteremia. Pulmonary edema secondary to CHF or secondary to multiple
   transfusions is another possibility, although asymmetric infiltrates
   would be atypical. Likewise, symptoms appear gradual in onset and not
   related to a specific transfusion or receipt of blood product. Pt
   likely has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage given frank blood in BAL.
   Etiologies in him include, thrombocytopenia, infection, cardiac causes.
   Most of his meds are not known to commonly cause respiratory side
   effects, although cyclosporine induced lung distress is one
   possibility. Inflammatory lung disease such as sarcoidosis, Wegener
   Goodpasture
s, or Lupus less likely given patient on steroids. Graft
   versus host disease does not generally cause hypoxic respiratory
   distress as this patient has.
   Patient is s/p bronchoscopy [**2167-4-29**]. Patient was in acute respiratory
   distress overnight for which was intubated, now on AC
   - Repeat bronchospy today to examine for continued bleed and/or trauma
   from intervenions given progressive respistorary failure
   - f/u bronchoscopy for gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, PCP
   smear, DFA for viral panel, viral culture, Cryptococcal Ag, and
   cytology for CMV
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics presumptively for treatment of
   hospital acquired pneumonia, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] atypical pneumonia
   --> vancomycin to cover MRSA
 dose by level
   --> cefepime to cover pseudomonas
   --> azithromycin to cover atypicals
   --> bactrim  and methylprednisoneto cover PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 400mg IV q8h
   --> consider adding antifungals if hypoxia persists
   - titrate antibiotics pending bronchoscopy results
   - f/u serum cryptoAg and urine legionella
   - f/u serum for toxo serology
   - for evaluation of CHF, check BNP and echo
   - transfuse platelets for plt > 50
   - place arterial line for arterial access
   - continue standing ipratropium and albuterol nebs standing
   - optimize ventilator settings as tolerated
   2. Bacteremia
   Patient with gram positive cocci in pairs and chains on blood culture.
   Potential pathogens include strep pneumo, enterococcus, or possibly
   oral flora such as peptostreptococcus or strep viridans. Patient
   immunocompramised for GVHD
   - will continue vancomycin for now
   - If patient becomes hemodynamically unstable in any way would broaden
   coverage for VRE changing vancomycin to linezolid
   - f/u echo for valvular vegetations
   - will keep hickman in place for now; if patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable, will need to pull lines and gain central
   access
   - f/u with BMT if immunospressive agents can be weaned in setting of
   infection.
   3. Acute Renal Failure
   Patient with baseline Cr 1.6-1.8 and now rising to 2.9. Etiology is
   likely multifactorial, including tacolimus and cyclosporine toxicity
   and dehydration.
   - renally dose meds, avoid further nephrotoxic agents
   - f/u FeNa
   - reconsult renal given acute change.
   4. Graft versus Host Disease: Patient with persistent GvHD with overall
   rising bilirubin.
   - continue ursodiol
   - continue cyclosporine, etanercept, mycophenolate mofetil, and
   methylprednisolone
   - check cyclosporine level in the AM
   - appreciate BMT recs
 will as about weaning immunosuppression.
   5. CMV Viremia
   Patient with history of CMV viremia.
   - continue ganciclovir
   - follow-up CMV level
   - continue enterocort for gut inflammation
   6. Multiple myeloma s/p Cord Tranplant:
   Continue management per BMT team.
   - monitor cell counts
   - continue cellcept, steroids, and cyclosporine
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - check daily cyclosporine levels
   - continue caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis; will follow-up with BMT
   regarding the need to continue this medication
   7. Hypertension:
   Normotensive currently.
   - will continue anti-HTN meds for now with labetalol and amlodipine
   - will increase holding parameters given patient's risk for hypotension
   secondary to sepsis in light of positive blood cultures
   8. Duodenitis
   Duodenitis seen on EGD.
   - continue PPI
   9. Diabetes
   Hyperglycemic with steroids
   - Continue humalog insulin sliding scale with insulin in TPN
   10. Chronic Pain
   Stable
   - continue MS Contin with morphine for prn pain

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He has been admitted with hypoxia and bacteremia, and is currently experiencing respiratory failure and intubated.

The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including infectious etiologies such as hospital-acquired pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, or viral pneumonia/pneumonitis; aspiration event unlikely. Other potential causes include opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) due to the patient's immunocompromised state from malignancy and immunosuppressive medications, or acute lung injury secondary to gram-positive bacteremia. Pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) or secondary to multiple transfusions is another possibility, although asymmetric infiltrates would be atypical. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, infection, and cardiac causes.

The patient's blood cultures revealed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, indicating a potential pathogen such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus species, or oral flora such as Peptostreptococcus or Streptococcus viridans. He is being treated with vancomycin for now, but if he becomes hemodynamically unstable, coverage for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) will be broadened by changing vancomycin to linezolid.

The patient also has acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level, likely due to factors such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine toxicity, dehydration, or other causes. Renal dosing of medications and avoiding further nephrotoxic agents are recommended.

Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is present, and the patient is being treated with ursodiol, cyclosporine, etanercept, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. Cyclosporine levels will be monitored, and weaning of immunosuppression will be considered.

CMV viremia is also present, and the patient is being treated with ganciclovir. CMV levels will be followed up, and enterocort for gut inflammation will continue.

Multiple myeloma post cord transplant management will be continued as per the BMT team recommendations.

Other conditions mentioned include duodenitis, diabetes, chronic pain, and hypertension. The patient is receiving appropriate treatments for these conditions, including proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for duodenitis, insulin for diabetes, MS Contin for chronic pain, and antihypertensive medications for hypertension.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of various complications including hypoxia, bacteremia, acute renal failure, GVHD, CMV viremia, multiple myeloma, and other comorbidities."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill immunocompromised host admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They underwent bronchoscopy without incident and were started on various antibiotics. However, their hypoxemia worsened, leading to intubation. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. They have multiple comorbidities and are receiving multiple medications. Vital signs show fever, stable blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and decreased hemoglobin levels. Fluid balance indicates fluid administration and output. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the chest, warm skin, and non-purposeful movement. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows diffuse pulmonary opacities, more prominent on the right side. Microbiology culture results indicate growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU, with plans to taper immunosuppression, check CSA level, and provide ICU care including nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, and nosocomial infections due to immunosuppression."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 y/o man with
   Respiratory Failure with diffuse pulmonary parenchymal opacities in an
   immunocompromised host
   -          Differential diagnosis here remains quite broad.  [**Doctor Last Name **] from
   bacteremia is probably the most likely, which may be complicated by
   DAH.  DAH here may be related to infection or may be an independent
   process (although immunosuppression makes this somewhat less likely).
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1845**], and CMV are certainly possible, as is CHF and other
   opportunistic infections.  Immunologenic phenomena (Goodpasture
   etc.) are on the list, but seem quite unlikely given his existing
   immunosuppression.
   -          Antibiotics as directed by ID
   o         vanco, cefepime, azithro for possible PNA
   o         Bactrim for possible PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]         Ganciclovir for possible PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]          Echo
   -          Repeat bronchoscopy today to determine if bleeding is from
   an isolated segment or appears more diffuse.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old immunocompromised man with respiratory failure. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has worsened, with hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary parenchymal opacities seen on the chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), and other opportunistic infections. Antibiotics and antivirals have been initiated as directed by the infectious disease (ID) team. A repeat bronchoscopy is planned to determine the source of bleeding. The patient is also being managed for acute renal failure, myeloma post-transplant, graft-versus-host disease, and thrombocytopenia. ICU care includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient remains critically ill and is currently admitted to the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with history of recurrent multiple myeloma now s/p cord
   blood transplant with complicated hospital course was admitted with
   hypoxia and bacteremia, with respiratory failure now intubated and
   vented.
   1. Hypoxia
   Etiology of patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial but has several
   possible causes. Differential includes infectious etiology including
   [**Hospital 1836**] [**Name10 (NameIs) 1837**] pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, or viral
   pneumonia/ pneumonitis such as influenza or CMV. aspiration event
   unlikely. Additional infectious etiologies include opportunistic
   infections such as PCP given patient's immunocompromised state from
   malignancy and immunosuppressive meds (steroids, cyclosporine, and
   mycophenylate mofetil) or acute lung injury secondary to gram positive
   bacteremia. Pulmonary edema secondary to CHF or secondary to multiple
   transfusions is another possibility, although asymmetric infiltrates
   would be atypical. Likewise, symptoms appear gradual in onset and not
   related to a specific transfusion or receipt of blood product. Pt
   likely has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage given frank blood in BAL.
   Etiologies in him include, thrombocytopenia, infection, cardiac causes.
   Most of his meds are not known to commonly cause respiratory side
   effects, although cyclosporine induced lung distress is one
   possibility. Inflammatory lung disease such as sarcoidosis, Wegener
   Goodpasture
s, or Lupus less likely given patient on steroids. Graft
   versus host disease does not generally cause hypoxic respiratory
   distress as this patient has.
   Patient is s/p bronchoscopy [**2167-4-29**]. Patient was in acute respiratory
   distress overnight for which was intubated, now on AC
   - Repeat bronchospy today to examine for continued bleed and/or trauma
   from intervenions given progressive respistorary failure
   - f/u bronchoscopy for gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, PCP
   smear, DFA for viral panel, viral culture, Cryptococcal Ag, and
   cytology for CMV
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics presumptively for treatment of
   hospital acquired pneumonia, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] atypical pneumonia
   --> vancomycin to cover MRSA
 dose by level
   --> cefepime to cover pseudomonas
   --> azithromycin to cover atypicals
   --> bactrim  and methylprednisoneto cover PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 400mg IV q8h
   --> consider adding antifungals if hypoxia persists
   - titrate antibiotics pending bronchoscopy results
   - f/u serum cryptoAg and urine legionella
   - f/u serum for toxo serology
   - for evaluation of CHF, check BNP and echo
   - transfuse platelets for plt > 50
   - place arterial line for arterial access
   - continue standing ipratropium and albuterol nebs standing
   - optimize ventilator settings as tolerated
   2. Bacteremia
   Patient with gram positive cocci in pairs and chains on blood culture.
   Potential pathogens include strep pneumo, enterococcus, or possibly
   oral flora such as peptostreptococcus or strep viridans. Patient
   immunocompramised for GVHD
   - will continue vancomycin for now
   - If patient becomes hemodynamically unstable in any way would broaden
   coverage for VRE changing vancomycin to linezolid
   - f/u echo for valvular vegetations
   - will keep hickman in place for now; if patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable, will need to pull lines and gain central
   access

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He has been admitted with hypoxia and bacteremia, resulting in respiratory failure and intubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST, set Vt of 550 mL, RR of 20, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 14. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin were not assessed, and neurologic examination was also not performed. The patient has been diagnosed with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) due to thrombocytopenia, infection, or cardiac causes.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including infectious etiologies such as hospital-acquired pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or PCP; aspiration event; pulmonary edema secondary to CHF or multiple transfusions; or acute lung injury secondary to gram-positive bacteremia. The patient has frank blood in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), suggesting diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) as an etiology.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains on blood culture. Potential pathogens include strep pneumo, enterococcus, or oral flora such as pe"

   Imaging: TTE
   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
   most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], the
   findings are similar. The study is suboptimal to evaluate for
   endocarditis. If clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended.
   CXR
   The ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina.  The double-lumen catheter
   tip is
   in distal SVC.  The cardiomegaly and mediastinal contours are stable.
   There
   is unchanged consolidation in the right lung and left base compared to
   the
   prior study.  Although possibility to asymmetric edema still persists
   but
   superimposed secondary process such as infection especially in the
   right lung
   should be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant.
- He was admitted with hypoxia and bacteremia and is now intubated and ventilated due to respiratory failure.
- The patient has multiple potential etiologies for his hypoxia, including infection (viral CMV, RSV, and bacterial strep in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with possible bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP).
- Treatment plans include addressing these possible etiologies, monitoring for GVHD and its impact on the lungs, managing bacteremia, and continuing immunosuppression.
- Other ongoing concerns include acute renal failure, liver involvement from GVHD, diabetes management, chronic pain, and hypertension.
- The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being managed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and insulin sliding scale, respectively.
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure and subsequent intubation and ventilation indicate a potential for ongoing hypoxia. The multiple etiologies for hypoxia need to be addressed and managed appropriately.

   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
   most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], the
   findings are similar. The study is suboptimal to evaluate for

   lung) w/ ? BOOP transition.
   Will treat possible etiologies as outlined below.
   For [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] maintain settings, possibly lower FiO2 this afternoon.
   -          DAH : transfusion goals: platelets > 50, HCT > 20, or if HCT
   drops by > 3.
   -          GVHD: discuss balance of infection + possible GVHD in lungs
   w/ BMT.  Will work on balance of immunosuppression and infection
   -          Pneumonia / Bacteremia: possible that bacteria in blood
   seeded lungs-> per lab, same organism: cont vancomycin, cefepime,
   azithro, gancyclovir.
   Otherwise:

   GBS in isolated both locations.  Reassuring that blood cultures NGTD.
   TTE neg for veg, however poor study.  Will defer TEE given bleeding
   risk, platelets.  Will reconsider in future.
   CMV
   Cont gancyclovir
   F/u Viral load.
   - continue enterocort for gut inflammation
   Fungal PPx
   Cont caspofungin
   3. ARF
   Creat continues to escalate.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) **].  Meds vs ATN (muddy brown
   casts).
   Will ask renal to re-see patient and comment.
   4. GVHD
   Liver involvement currently.  Unclear if now involving lungs.
   Cont ursodiol
   Cont MM.
   Decreaded solumedrol to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Check cyclosporine level (8pm level will be true trough, last nights
   dose given 11pm) at 8pm and tomorrow AM.
   5 Multiple myeloma s/p Cord Tranplant:
   Continue management per BMT team.
   - monitor cell counts
   - continue cellcept, steroids, and cyclosporine
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - check daily cyclosporine levels
   - continue caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis; will follow-up with BMT
   regarding the need to continue this medication
   6. Hypertension:
   Cont continue anti-HTN meds for now with labetalol and amlodipine
   PRN Hydral.
   7. Duodenitis
   Duodenitis seen on EGD.
   - continue PPI
   8. Diabetes
   Hyperglycemic with steroids
   - Continue humalog insulin sliding scale with insulin in TPN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxia and bacteremia, and is now intubated and ventilated due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia with multiple etiologies such as infection (viral CMV, RSV; bacterial strep in blood and BAL), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) with possible bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) transition. The patient is being treated for possible etiologies as outlined below.

The patient also has bacteremia with group B strep in both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and is being treated with antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and gancyclovir.

Other medical issues include acute renal failure (ARF) with escalating creatinine levels, liver involvement of GVHD, multiple myeloma post cord transplant, hypertension, duodenitis seen on endoscopic examination, and diabetes managed with humalog insulin sliding scale.

The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, caspofungin, vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, gancyclovir, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/67 mmHg to 194/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to immunosuppression from GVHD and medications, further deterioration of renal function, progression of GVHD involving the liver and lungs, complications related to multiple myeloma post cord transplant, and management of hypertension, duodenitis, and diabetes.

The patient's overall condition is stable, but close monitoring and management of these potential complications are necessary."

   lung) w/ obliterative bronchiolitis. PCP ruled out.
   Will treat possible etiologies as outlined below.
   - For [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] maintain settings as pt failed PSV trial this AM, did
   not maintain volumes, will lower FiO2 and try weaning later in day.
   - DAH: transfusion goals: platelets > 50, HCT > 20, or if HCT drops by
   > 3.
   - GVHD: discuss balance of infection + possible GVHD in lungs w/ BMT.
   Will work on balance of immunosuppression and infection, patient on
   methylprednisone
   - Pneumonia / Bacteremia: possible that bacteria in blood seeded
   lungs-> per lab, same organism: cont vancomycin, cefepime, azithro,
   gancyclovir.
   - cont nebs
   - f/u culture data - sensitivities

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxia and bacteremia, leading to respiratory failure and intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypertension, acute renal failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and duodenitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia has multiple etiologies including infection (bacterial), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and GVHD with obliterative bronchiolitis. It is important to treat these possible etiologies accordingly.
2. GVHD: The patient has a history of skin involvement and current liver involvement. It is essential to continue managing GVHD with immunosuppressive medications such as solumedrol, ursodiol, and cyclosporine. Regular monitoring of cyclosporine levels is also necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are escalating, indicating ARF. The cause may be related to medications or acute tubular necrosis (muddy brown casts). Renal dosing of medications and further evaluation are required.
4. Duodenitis: The patient has duodenitis seen on endoscopic examination. Continued proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is recommended.
5. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive despite being on amlod"

   Imaging: [**4-30**] ECHO
   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
   most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], the
   findings are similar. The study is suboptimal to evaluate for
   endocarditis. If clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended.

   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
   most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], the
   findings are similar. The study is suboptimal to evaluate for
   endocarditis. If clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with history of recurrent multiple myeloma now s/p cord
   blood transplant with complicated hospital course was admitted with
   hypoxia and bacteremia, with respiratory failure now intubated and
   vented.
   Hypoxia: Multiple etiologies:  Infection (Most likely Bacterial: strep
   in blood and bal), Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, GVHD (migrated to the
   lung) w/ obliterative bronchiolitis. PCP ruled out.
   Will treat possible etiologies as outlined below.
   - For [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] maintain settings as pt failed PSV trial this AM, did
   not maintain volumes, will lower FiO2 and try weaning later in day.
   - DAH: transfusion goals: platelets > 50, HCT > 20, or if HCT drops by
   > 3.
   - GVHD: discuss balance of infection + possible GVHD in lungs w/ BMT.
   Will work on balance of immunosuppression and infection, patient on
   methylprednisone
   - Pneumonia / Bacteremia: possible that bacteria in blood seeded
   lungs-> per lab, same organism: cont vancomycin, cefepime, azithro,
   gancyclovir.
   - cont nebs
   - f/u culture data - sensitivities
   - f/u ID recs
 input appreciated.
   ID: Bacteremia: group B strep in both blood and from BAL. Serveillence
   cultures negative to date. TTE neg for veg, however poor study.  Will
   defer TEE given bleeding risk, platelets.  Will reconsider in future.
   - CMV: viral loads [**Last Name (LF) 1881**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont gancyclovir
   - continue enterocort for gut inflammation
   - Fungal PPx: Cont caspofungin
   Cardiovascular: Hypertension:  Patient hypertensive since yesterday to
   the 180s, already on amlodipine and labetolol. Cant do ace because of

   - started hydralazine 10mg iv q6, still high, increased to 20 mg IV
   ARF: Creat continues to escalate.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1882**], but considering
   Meds vs ATN (muddy brown casts).
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   GVHD: Liver involvement currently, history of skin involvement
   considering obliterative bronchiolitis
   - Cont ursodiol

   - continue solumedrol to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - Check cyclosporine level (8pm level will be true trough, last nights
   dose given 11pm) at 8pm and tomorrow AM.
   Multiple myeloma s/p Cord Transplant: Continue management per BMT team.
   - monitor cell counts
   - continue cellcept, steroids, and cyclosporine
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - check daily cyclosporine levels
   - continue caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis; will follow-up with BMT
   regarding the need to continue this medication

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxia and bacteremia, and is now intubated and ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pneumonia/bacteremia, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has multiple etiologies for hypoxia, including infection (bacterial), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and GVHD with obliterative bronchiolitis. Treatment will be aimed at addressing these possible causes.
2. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient has a history of skin involvement and current liver involvement. Treatment will involve immunosuppression with medications such as methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus.
3. Pneumonia/bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with group B strep in both blood and BAL. Surveillance cultures are negative. Antibiotics will be continued, and further ID recommendations will be followed based on culture data.
4. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Transfusion goals include platelets > 50 and HCT > 20. Close monitoring of blood counts and HCT levels will be done.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels continue to escalate"

","The patient is a 54-year-old male who underwent stem cell transplantation and is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's main complaints are respiratory distress and paradoxical breathing, which has improved with increased PEEP. 

The patient has a history of hypertension and allergies to no known drugs. He has been receiving various antibiotics and antiviral medications since admission. 

On the flow sheet, the patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 182/87 to 199/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and spontaneous ventilation allowed. 

The physical examination reveals intermittent paradoxical breathing, diffuse end expiratory wheezes in the chest, obesity with occasional forced exhalation and abdominal rounding, chronic scarring on the extremities, and the patient being non-responsive to verbal stimuli but minimally responsive to tactile stimulation. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytopenia with a WBC count ranging from 1.9 to 3.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count ranging from 32 to 58 K/uL, elevated serum creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin level, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. 

The patient has positive blood cultures for Group B streptococcus and negative tests for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including Streptococcal pneumonia with bacteremia, developing obliterative bronchiolitis, some alveolar hemorrhage, and immunogenic phenomena. The patient is being continued on mechanical ventilation with efforts to convert to pressure support ventilation. Antibiotics have been started for possible pneumonia, and antiviral medication has been initiated for possible cytomegalovirus infection. 

The patient also has bacteremia with Group B streptococcus, acute renal failure most likely due to acute tubular necrosis, myeloma post-transplant, graft versus host disease, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. ICU care includes boots, proton pump inhibitor, and total parenteral nutrition. 

The patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his complex medical conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with respiratory distress and paradoxical breathing, which has improved with increased PEEP. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities such as hypertension, SSRI use, Vitd, MMF, Solumedrol, and CSA. The patient is receiving several medications including antibiotics (Bactrim, Vancomycin, Cefipime, Caspofungin, Azithromycin, and Gancyclovir), pain management with Fentanyl, sedation with Midazolam, and other ICU medications like Lansoprazole.

Vital signs are within normal limits except for elevated blood pressure readings. Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable cardiac function with a sinus rhythm. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 4,523 mL and output of 3,010 mL, with positive fluid balance of 1,513 mL. Respiratory support includes CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 550 mL, RR set at 20, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, RSBI of 11, PIP of 28 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O. Oxygenation is satisfactory with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 202 and SpO2 of 100%.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with WBC count"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent stem cell transplantation and is now experiencing graft versus host disease (GVHD). He was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The patient has been diagnosed with Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways disease (COPD) with developing obliterative bronchiolitis, and some alveolar hemorrhage. 

The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics for possible pneumonia, prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and antiviral medication for possible Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. 

In addition to respiratory failure, the patient also has bacteremia caused by beta strep, acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), thrombocytopenia, and anemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to bacteremia, further decline in renal function, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and potential nutritional issues due to bowel problems. 

The patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill male with respiratory distress. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CMV mode, set Vt of 550 mL, RR of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an RSBI of 11. The patient has been paradoxically breathing intermittently, which improved with increased PEEP. His blood glucose levels are elevated, and he has a history of hypertension. The patient is not responsive to verbal stimuli but shows minimal response to tactile stimulation. There are diffuse end expiratory wheezes in the chest, obesity with forced exhalation and abdominal rounding, and chronic scarring on the extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high creatinine, and low albumin levels. The patient has a positive culture for group B strep in blood and BAL samples.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular cultures of respiratory secretions should be done to identify any signs of infection.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: The patient's low platelet count and positive blood culture for group B strep suggest a possible nosocomial bloodstream infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated, and further investigations should be done to identify the source of infection"

   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
   most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], the
   findings are similar. The study is suboptimal to evaluate for
   endocarditis. If clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with history of recurrent multiple myeloma now s/p cord
   blood transplant with complicated hospital course was admitted with
   hypoxia and bacteremia, with respiratory failure now intubated and
   vented.
   Hypoxia: Multiple etiologies:  Infection (Most likely Bacterial: strep
   in blood and bal), Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, GVHD (migrated to the
   lung) w/ obliterative bronchiolitis. PCP ruled out.
   Will treat possible etiologies as outlined below.
   - For [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] maintain settings as pt failed PSV trial this AM, did
   not maintain volumes and used abdominal breathing, will lower FiO2 and
   try weaning later in day.
   - DAH: transfusion goals: platelets > 50, HCT > 20, or if HCT drops by
   > 3.
   - GVHD: discuss balance of infection + possible GVHD in lungs w/ BMT.
   Will work on balance of immunosuppression and infection, patient on
   methylprednisone
   - Pneumonia / Bacteremia: possible that bacteria in blood seeded
   lungs-> per lab, same organism: cont vancomycin, cefepime, azithro,
   gancyclovir.
   - cont nebs
   - f/u culture data - sensitivities
   - f/u ID recs
 input appreciated.
   ID: Bacteremia: group B strep in both blood and from BAL. Serveillence
   cultures negative to date. TTE neg for veg, however poor study.  Will
   defer TEE given bleeding risk, platelets.  Will reconsider in future.
   Patient ruled out for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue [**Name9 (PRE) 1886**] and azithromycin (day 1: [**4-29**]) day 4
   - Dose Vanco by level, will check level in AM
   - CMV: viral loads [**Last Name (LF) 1881**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont gancyclovir, will recheck next
   weeek
   - continue enterocort for gut inflammation
   - Fungal PPx: Cont caspofungin
   - Patient on steroids, should be in PCP prophylaxis with dapsone (given
   renal failure, not bactrim), pending G6PD level
   - ID recs appreciated
   Cardiovascular: Hypertension:  Patient hypertensive since yesterday to
   the 180s, already on amlodipine and labetolol. Cant do ace because of
   renal failure
   - amlodipine 10mg daily
   - labetolol 400 TID
   - started hydralazine 10mg iv q6, still high, increased to 20 mg IV
   ARF: Creat continues to escalate.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1882**], but considering
   Meds vs ATN (muddy brown casts).
   - renal recs appreciated: will send SPEP and UPEP, 24hour urine
   protein, minimize cyclosporine
   - renally dose meds
   GVHD: Liver involvement currently, history of skin involvement
   considering obliterative bronchiolitis
   - Cont ursodiol
   - Cont MM.
   - continue solumedrol to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - Check cyclosporine level (8pm level will be true trough, last nights
   dose given 11pm) at 8pm and tomorrow AM.
   Multiple myeloma s/p Cord Transplant: Continue management per BMT team.
   - monitor cell counts
   - continue cellcept, steroids, and cyclosporine
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - check daily cyclosporine levels
   - continue caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis; will follow-up with BMT
   regarding the need to continue this medication
   Duodenitis: Duodenitis seen on EGD.
   - continue PPI
   Diabetes: Hyperglycemic with steroids
   - Continue humalog insulin sliding scale with insulin in TPN
   Chronic Pain: Will hold MS Contin with morphine for prn pain while
   sedated on fentanyl.

The patient's condition is complicated by infection (likely bacterial, specifically group B strep), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's blood culture and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) both showed group B strep infection. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and ganciclovir. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued infection: The patient's blood culture and BAL both indicate a group B strep infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's clinical presentation suggests the possibility of DAH. Close monitoring of respiratory status and hemodynamic stability is necessary. Transfusion goals include platelets > 50 and HCT > 20.
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): GVHD is a common complication after stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. The patient has a history of skin involvement and current liver involvement. Management includes immunosuppression with medications such as methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, and"

   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
   the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
   most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], the
   findings are similar. The study is suboptimal to evaluate for
   endocarditis. If clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who recently underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxia and bacteremia, and is currently intubated and ventilated. The patient has several medical complications including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pneumonia/bacteremia, and acute renal failure. He is being treated for these conditions with various medications and therapies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia due to multiple etiologies such as infection, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and GVHD with obliterative bronchiolitis. It is important to monitor oxygen saturation levels and adjust ventilator settings accordingly.
2. Pneumonia/Bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed bacteremia with group B strep in both blood and BAL cultures. Vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and gancyclovir are being continued for treatment.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels continue to escalate, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function tests including SPEP, UPEP, and 24-hour urine protein should be done. Medications should be dosed based on renal function, and efforts should be made to minimize cyclosporine.
4. GVHD: The patient has liver involvement and a"

   Assessment and Plan
   54M h/o recurrent multiple myeloma s/p cord blood transplant admitted
   with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, now intubated.
   Hypoxia: Multiple etiologies:  Infection (Most likely Bacterial: strep
   in blood and bal), Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, GVHD (migrated to the
   lung) w/ obliterative bronchiolitis. PCP ruled out.
   Will treat possible etiologies as outlined below.
   - For [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] maintain settings as pt failed PSV trial this AM, did
   not maintain volumes and used abdominal breathing, will lower FiO2 and
   try weaning later in day.
   - DAH: transfusion goals: platelets > 50, HCT > 20, or if HCT drops by
   > 3.
   - GVHD: discuss balance of infection + possible GVHD in lungs w/ BMT.
   Will work on balance of immunosuppression and infection, patient on
   methylprednisone
   - Pneumonia / Bacteremia: possible that bacteria in blood seeded
   lungs-> per lab, same organism: cont vancomycin, cefepime, azithro,
   gancyclovir.
   - cont nebs
   - f/u culture data - sensitivities
   - f/u ID recs
 input appreciated.
   ID: Bacteremia: group B strep in both blood and from BAL. Serveillence
   cultures negative to date. TTE neg for veg, however poor study.  Will
   defer TEE given bleeding risk, platelets.  Will reconsider in future.
   Patient ruled out for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue [**Name9 (PRE) 1886**] and azithromycin (day 1: [**4-29**]) day 4
   - Dose Vanco by level, will check level in AM
   - CMV: viral loads [**Last Name (LF) 1881**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont gancyclovir, will recheck next
   weeek
   - continue enterocort for gut inflammation
   - Fungal PPx: Cont caspofungin
   - Patient on steroids, should be in PCP prophylaxis with dapsone (given
   renal failure, not bactrim), pending G6PD level
   - ID recs appreciated
   Cardiovascular: Hypertension:  Patient hypertensive since yesterday to
   the 180s, already on amlodipine and labetolol. Cant do ace because of
   renal failure
   - amlodipine 10mg daily
   - labetolol 400 TID
   - started hydralazine 10mg iv q6, still high, increased to 20 mg IV
   ARF: Creat continues to escalate.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1882**], but considering
   Meds vs ATN (muddy brown casts).
   - renal recs appreciated: will send SPEP and UPEP, 24hour urine
   protein, minimize cyclosporine
   - renally dose meds
   GVHD: Liver involvement currently, history of skin involvement
   considering obliterative bronchiolitis
   - Cont ursodiol
   - Cont MM.
   - continue solumedrol to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - Check cyclosporine level (8pm level will be true trough, last nights
   dose given 11pm) at 8pm and tomorrow AM.
   Multiple myeloma s/p Cord Transplant: Continue management per BMT team.
   - monitor cell counts
   - continue cellcept, steroids, and cyclosporine
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - check daily cyclosporine levels
   - continue caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis; will follow-up with BMT
   regarding the need to continue this medication
   Duodenitis: Duodenitis seen on EGD.
   - continue PPI
   Diabetes: Hyperglycemic with steroids
   - Continue humalog insulin sliding scale with insulin in TPN

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma, post cord blood transplant, admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and intubated.
- Currently on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal PPx, cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia.
- Renal recs ordered, hypertension being managed with hydralazine.
- No known drug allergies.
- Various lab results and imaging pending.
- Assessment and plan include treating possible etiologies of hypoxia, managing GVHD, pneumonia/bacteremia, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which can lead to decreased oxygen supply to vital organs, resulting in organ damage or failure.
2. Infection: The presence of bacteremia and group B strep in the blood and BAL indicates an ongoing infection that could potentially spread and cause sepsis.
3. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): DAH can occur as a complication of multiple myeloma or as a result of GVHD. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
4. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD): The patient's history of recurrent multiple myeloma and cord blood transplant puts him at risk for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and is currently intubated. The patient is being treated with ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis, and a combination of antibiotics for group B strep infection in the BAL/bacteremia.

The patient's vital signs show hypertension, with a blood pressure ranging from 178/92 to 199/97 mmHg. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, and his oxygen saturation is maintained at 99% on ventilator support. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received multiple doses of various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, lansoprazole, and others. His fluid balance shows an intake of 4,168 mL and output of 3,650 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 518 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and there are abnormalities in electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. Imaging and microbiology tests are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
- Hypoxia: The patient likely has a group B strep pulmonary infection with possible DAH and/or obliter"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and intubated. He is receiving treatment for CMV viremia with ganciclovir, fungal prophylaxis with caspofungin, and antibiotics for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has been hypertensive since yesterday. He also has renal failure with worsening creatinine levels. There is evidence of liver involvement in GVHD, and he is being treated with methylprednisolone and cyclosporine. The patient has duodenitis seen on EGD, and he is being managed with PPI. He also has diabetes and chronic pain. His nutritional needs are being met through TPN with lipids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia due to likely group B strep pulmonary infection or obliterative bronchiolitis secondary to lung GVHD.
2. Further deterioration of renal function, possibly progressing to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Development of CMV complications despite ganciclovir therapy.
4. Fungal infection due to fungal prophylaxis failure.
5. Persistent bacteremia despite antibiotic therapy.
6. Progression of GVHD, particularly liver and skin involvement.
7. Complications related to diabetes management while on steroids.
8. Possible duodenitis-related complications.
9. Pain management challenges while sedated on fentanyl.
10. Potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization.
11. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
12. Other opportunistic infections due to immunosuppression."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and is currently intubated. The patient is receiving ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis, and antibiotics for group B strep bacteremia in the blood and BAL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia due to multiple etiologies including infection (most likely bacterial), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with obliterative bronchiolitis.
2. Infection: The patient has bacteremia caused by group B strep, and there is a concern for possible pneumonia as well. The same organism has been cultured from both the blood and BAL, so vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and ganciclovir will be continued.
3. DAH: The patient's platelet count is low, and HCT is below 20. Transfusion goals include platelets > 50 and HCT > 20.
4. GVHD: The patient has liver involvement currently, with a history of skin involvement. Obliterative bronchiolitis may also be a concern.
5. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's creatinine"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who has undergone stem cell transplantation. He is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. The patient's medical history includes graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is making it challenging to manage his immunosuppression. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia. He is being treated with antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. However, only GBS (Gram-negative bacilli) is currently growing, and the plan is to switch to cefepime monotherapy.

The patient also has obstructive airways disease, possibly complicated by developing obliterative bronchiolitis. Additionally, there is some alveolar hemorrhage complicating his other issues.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is being closely monitored, and his fluid balance is being managed carefully. 

The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is on medications for hypertension. He is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, anemia, and requires ongoing monitoring and management of his condition.

The patient's care involves collaboration between the BMT (Bone Marrow Transplant) team and ID (Infectious Diseases) regarding immunosuppression, especially considering his GVHD. The patient is receiving"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent stem cell transplantation. He is currently in the ICU due to complications from graft versus host disease (GVHD). The patient has developed new respiratory failure, which is believed to be caused by Streptococcal pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways disease (COPD), developing obliterative bronchiolitis, and some alveolar hemorrhage. 

The patient is being treated with antibiotics for the pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. He is also receiving ganciclovir for possible cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Clostridium difficile infection is being considered. 

The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and his blood counts indicate anemia and thrombocytopenia. He has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and medication effects. 

The patient's condition is described as critically ill, and he remains on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). His arterial line and tunneled line placements are noted. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and is currently intubated. The patient is being treated with ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis, and cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in the BAL/bacteremia.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia likely due to a group B strep pulmonary infection or obliterative bronchiolitis secondary to lung GVHD. The ventilator settings need to be adjusted to decrease FiO2.
2. DAH (Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage): The patient has DAH, which may be secondary to GVHD or infection. The goals for transfusion include platelets > 50, HCT > 20, or if HCT drops by > 3.
3. Lung GVHD: The patient has stable lung GVHD, and methylprednisolone and cyclosporine have been initiated.
4. Pneumonia/Bacteremia: The patient has group B strep bacteremia, and treatment with cefepime and azithromycin will continue. Vancomycin has been discontinued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma, who underwent cord blood transplant and is currently admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, and on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal post-transplant prophylaxis, and cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep infection in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)/bacteremia. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hypoxia likely due to group B strep pulmonary infection or obliterative bronchiolitis secondary to lung graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), DAH, and potential lung GVHD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which can be life-threatening if not adequately managed. The underlying cause of hypoxia needs to be addressed promptly.
2. Group B strep bacteremia/pulmonary infection: The patient is currently being treated with cefepime and azithromycin for group B strep bacteremia and pneumonia. However, there is a risk of antibiotic resistance or treatment failure, so close monitoring and appropriate adjustments to the antibiotic regimen may be necessary.
3. Obliterative bronchiolitis/lung GVHD: The patient's hypoxia could be attributed to obliterative bronchiolitis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. The patient was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and is currently intubated. The patient is also on ganciclovir for CMV viremia and caspofungin for fungal post-transplant prophylaxis.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has multiple etiologies for hypoxia, with a leaning toward GVHD in the lung with possible BOOP overlay, causing an obstructive process. Another possibility is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The treatment goals include decreasing FiO2, achieving platelets greater than 50, HCT greater than 20, and administering methylprednisolone and cyclosporine for lung GVHD.
2. Infection: The patient has Group B strep bacteremia, which will be treated with cefepime and azithromycin. The patient also has a negative PCP test and needs to be evaluated for steroid use. The patient has CMV viremia and will continue with ganciclovir. Fungal post-transplant prophylaxis will continue with caspofungin.
3. Hypertension: The patient has persistently hypertensive blood pressure readings. Treatment includes increasing labetalol to 600 mg TID, furosemide 60 mg IV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and intubated. He is currently on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis, and cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia. The patient's hypoxia is believed to be caused by multiple etiologies, including GVHD in the lung with possible BOOP overlay, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and CMV pneumonia. The patient's infection and ID plan includes continuing cefepime for group B strep bacteremia, discontinuing azithromycin, and starting dapsone for PCP prophylaxis. The patient's renal function is also being closely monitored, with labetalol increased to 800mg TID to maintain -1L negative and furosemide 60mg IV x1. The patient's liver function tests are increasing, raising concern for reactivation of GVHD, and immunosuppression will be discussed with BMT. The patient's multiple myeloma status is stable, and he will continue management per BMT recommendations. Other ongoing care includes nutrition via TPN, glycemic control with sliding scale insulin, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

   54M h/o recurrent multiple myeloma s/p cord blood transplant admitted
   with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, on ganciclovir
   for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal PPx,
   cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia.
   # Hypoxia
   Multiple etiologies, however we are leaning toward GVHD in lung w/
   possible BOOP overlay, causing obstructive process.  Also on ddx still
   is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and CMV pneumonia.  Although GBS in
   lung, w/ low counts and now w/ adequate treatment unlikely causing this
   level of hypoxemia.
   Will eval level of autopeep today, and if possible match w/ PEEP of 8.
   Per ID, unlikely that CMV is active in lung given relatively low recent
   CMV VL counts.  Will f/u recent VL.
   -          PEEP to 8 for goal today
   -          Discuss GVHD treatment w/ ONC today
   -          GVHD?: Cont Methylprednisolone 30mg [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75mg
   [**Hospital1 **]
   -          Pneumonia / bacteremia: Group B strep in blood, lung:
   Cefepime, azithromycin (d1 = [**4-29**]).  D/c vancomycin.
   -          Supportive care: Nebs, suctioning
   # Infection / ID

   **PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**]
   G6Pd levels wnl previously, start Dapsone 100 mg daily
   **CMV viremia: Continue gancyclovir, recheck viral loads weekly;
   unlikely causing lung / liver findings
   **Fungal PPx: Continue caspofungin
    # RENAL
   **HTNPersistently hypertensive.  Likely volume playing a role in
   refractory HTN.
   - Labetolol increased to 800mg TID; furosemide 60mg IV x1 to maintain
   -1L negative
   - Hydralazine 20 mg IV Q6H, amlodipine 10mg daily
   **ARF: Meds vs ATN (muddy brown casts).
   - SPEP, UPEP pending, 24H urine protein pending
   - Renal following
   - Renally dose meds, minimize cyclosporine
   # GVHD: LIVER
   LFTs, esp T Bili increasing, raising concern for reactivation now w/
   decreased immunosuppression.:
   -          Continue ursodiol, mycophenylate mofetil, solumedrol 30 mg
   [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] (follow cyclosporine levels).
   -          Discuss increase immunosuppression w/ BMT

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent stem cell transplantation and is now experiencing graft versus host disease (GVHD). He has developed respiratory failure due to Streptococcal pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways disease (COPD), alveolar hemorrhage, and possible CMV infection. He is receiving antibiotics for the pneumonia and prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). His condition is complicated by acute renal failure, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. The patient remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD can cause damage to the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Monitoring for signs of GVHD and adjusting immunosuppression accordingly is crucial.
3. Infection: Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient may develop new infections due to his immunocompromised state. Regular surveillance cultures and prompt treatment are essential.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may worsen, requiring ongoing monitoring and adjustment of renal dose medications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet levels and transfusion as needed are important to prevent bleeding complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent stem cell transplantation. He is now experiencing respiratory failure due to Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways disease (COPD), and possible alveolar hemorrhage. The patient is also on prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and cytomegalovirus (CMV).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the pneumonia does not respond to antibiotic therapy or if there is progression of obstructive airways disease.
2. Alveolar Hemorrhage: The presence of alveolar hemorrhage could lead to further respiratory compromise and may require additional interventions such as blood transfusions or specific treatments for the underlying cause.
3. Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD is a potential complication following stem cell transplantation and can cause multiorgan dysfunction. The rising bilirubin levels are concerning for GVHD, which may require adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may be due to acute tubular necrosis or medication-related nephrotoxicity. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal ("

   Respiratory Failure
   -          Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia which we
   are day #4 on ABX
   -          Obstructive Airways: COPD+/- developing obliterative
   bronchiolitis.
   -          some alveolar hemorrhage complicating his other issues.
   o         Cefipime monotherapy for GBS
   o         convert to PCP prophylaxis Dapsone
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]         Ganciclovir for possible CMV- follow up VL today
   o         Has unusual end exp push
 there all the time but worse when
   he takes a large TV on PSV. Is this an effort to autoPEEP himself via
   end exp grunting due to volume overload- trying to diurese. Is this
   related to BO and when large tidal volume perceives flow limited and
   tried to assist exhalation (though not helping as liekly oon fixed
   portion of flow volume curve). Brought RT [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 1911**] and Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 297**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1912**]
   to bedisde for further evaluation and confirmed my findings. At this
   point we will try to treat PNA, diurese, nebs, getting steroids, and
   will work with efforts to get back on PSV.
   Bacteremia (Beta Strep)

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent stem cell transplantation and is now experiencing graft versus host disease (GVHD). He has developed respiratory failure due to Streptococcal pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways disease (COPD), and alveolar hemorrhage. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires intensive care unit (ICU) support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of Streptococcal pneumonia with bacteremia, COPD, and alveolar hemorrhage. This can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis if not promptly managed.
2. Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD is a complication of stem cell transplantation where the donated cells attack the recipient's body. It can affect various organs, including the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Monitoring for signs of GVHD and providing appropriate immunosuppression is crucial in managing this condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or medication effects. Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly are important.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusion may be necessary to maintain a safe"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma and stem cell transplant, now presenting with new respiratory failure.
- He has been diagnosed with Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways (COPD), developing obliterative bronchiolitis, and some alveolar hemorrhage.
- The patient is currently on various antibiotics for pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin, with Ganciclovir for possible CMV infection.
- The patient's end-expiratory pressure has been increased to 11-13 with positive pressure ventilation (PSV), and will be monitored closely.
- The patient also has bacteremia (Beta Strep), which is being treated with antibiotics.
- Other issues include acute renal failure, graft vs. host disease (GVHD), thrombocytopenia, and anemia.
- The patient remains critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the combination of pneumonia, obstructive airways, and alveolar hemorrhage. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Bacterial Infection: The patient has bacteremia caused by Beta Strep, which may lead to sepsis if not effectively treated with antibiotics. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   54M h/o recurrent multiple myeloma s/p cord blood transplant admitted
   with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, on ganciclovir
   for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal PPx,
   cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia.
   Hypoxia
   Multiple etiologies, however we are leaning toward GVHD in lung w/
   possible BOOP overlay, causing obstructive process.  Also on ddx still
   is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and CMV pneumonia.  Although GBS in
   lung, w/ low counts and now w/ adequate treatment unlikely causing this
   level of hypoxemia.  Per ID, unlikely that CMV is active in lung given
   relatively low recent CMV VL counts.
   - Vent goal: patient tolerated PSV 5/5 all day, will likely move up to
   [**11-11**] overnight, and possible SPT tomorrow.
   - will wean sedation
   - GVHD: Increase Methylprednisolone to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pneumonia / bacteremia: Group B strep in blood, lung: continue
   Cefepime day [**8-17**] (d1 = [**4-29**]).  s/p 5 days azithromycin.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suctioning
   Right upper extremity swelling: unclear why, since low platelets and
   liver function, but evaluate for thrombus with UE u/s
   Infection / ID
   **Group B strep bacteremia: TTE negative for vegetations; TEE deferred
   [**3-7**] bleeding risk
   - continue cefepime 7/14 days today
   - s/p azithro
   **PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Dapsone 100 mg daily
   **CMV viremia: Continue gancyclovir, recheck viral loads weekly;
   unlikely causing lung / liver findings
   **Fungal PPx: Continue caspofungin
    # RENAL
   **HTN Persistently hypertensive. Likely volume playing a role in
   refractory HTN.
   - Labetolol 800mg TID; furosemide 60mg IV x1 to maintain -1L negative
   - Hydralazine 20 mg IV Q6H, amlodipine 10mg daily
   **ARF: Meds vs ATN (muddy brown casts).
   - SPEP, UPEP pending, 24H urine protein pending
   - Renal following
   - Renally dose meds, minimize cyclosporine
   **Uremia: unclear etiology. Probably secondary to worsening renal
   function and GI bleeding.
   - platelet transusions
   - consider DDAVP
   # GVHD: LIVER
   LFTs, esp T Bili increasing, raising concern for reactivation now w/
   decreased immunosuppression. Also consider TTP with LDH in the 1000
   this is unlikely all secondary to GVHD, likely mutliple etiologies.
   -          Continue ursodiol, mycophenylate mofetil, solumedrol 30 mg
   [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] (follow cyclosporine levels).
   -          Discuss increase immunosuppression w/ BMT
   - patient not good candidate for plasma exchange right now, already
   prednosone.
   # HEME / ONC
   **Multiple myeloma s/p cord transplant: STABLE.  Continue management
   per BMT recs.
   - Continue mycophenylate mofetil, solumedrol, cyclosporine

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He is currently admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, and receiving treatment for various infections including CMV viremia, fungal pneumonia, and group B strep bacteremia. The patient's condition is complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which has affected his lungs and liver. There are concerns about possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, CMV pneumonia, and thrombotic microangiopathy as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia due to multiple etiologies, including GVHD with an obstructive process, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and CMV pneumonia.
2. GVHD: The patient has developed GVHD, affecting both his lungs and liver. This condition requires increased immunosuppression to manage.
3. Pneumonia/Bacteremia: The patient has group B strep bacteremia and pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy is ongoing, but there is a risk of infection progression or development of antibiotic resistance.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of renal failure, possibly due to medications or acute tubular necrosis. Further evaluation and management are needed.
5. Hypertension: The patient has persistently high blood pressure, likely related to volume overload. Medications have been initiated to control blood pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, and on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal post-transplant prophylaxis, cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in the BAL/bacteremia. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypoxia, infection, renal failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which could be due to GVHD in the lung with possible bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) overlay, causing an obstructive process. Other potential causes include diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and CMV pneumonia. The patient's autopeep level will be evaluated today, and PEEP will be adjusted accordingly. Recent CMV viral load counts will also be followed up.

2. Infection: The patient has group B strep bacteremia and pneumonia, for which he is receiving cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin. He is also being treated for CMV viremia with ganciclovir and fungal infection with caspofungin. The patient's immune system is compromised due to the transplant"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent stem cell transplantation. He is currently experiencing complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), respiratory failure, bacteremia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if his condition worsens. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potentially require mechanical ventilation.

2. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteremia indicates an ongoing infection in the bloodstream. If left untreated or if the infection spreads, it can lead to sepsis and septic shock.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if kidney function does not improve. This could result in further fluid accumulation, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.

4. Thrombocytopenia: With a low platelet count, the patient is at an increased risk of bleeding, particularly if any invasive procedures or surgeries are required.

5. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD is a serious complication after stem cell transplantation where the donated cells recognize the recipient's tissues as foreign and attack them. The patient's rising bilirubin levels are concerning for GVHD, and if not managed appropriately, it can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with multiple myeloma who underwent stem cell transplantation and is now experiencing graft versus host disease (GVHD). He has developed respiratory failure due to Streptococcal pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways disease (COPD), and alveolar hemorrhage. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving supportive care measures such as diuretics, nebulizers, and steroids. Other ongoing concerns include acute renal failure, myeloma post-transplant, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes Streptococcal pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways disease (COPD), and alveolar hemorrhage. The mainstay of treatment includes antibiotics, diuretics, nebulizers, and supportive measures. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, indicated by rising creatinine levels. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or medication effects. Stopping nephrotoxic medications like Bactrim and renal dosing adjustments may be necessary. Further evaluation of renal function is needed.

3. Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD is a common complication"

   Assessment and Plan
   54M h/o recurrent multiple myeloma s/p cord blood transplant admitted
   with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, on ganciclovir
   for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal PPx,
   cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia.
   # Hypoxia
   Multiple etiologies, however we are leaning toward GVHD in lung w/
   possible BOOP overlay, causing obstructive process.  Also on ddx still
   is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and CMV pneumonia.  Although GBS in
   lung, w/ low counts and now w/ adequate treatment unlikely causing this
   level of hypoxemia.  Per ID, unlikely that CMV is active in lung given
   relatively low recent CMV VL counts.
   - Vent goal: patient tolerated PSV 5/5 all day, will likely move up to
   [**11-11**] overnight, and possible SPT tomorrow.
   - will wean sedation
   - GVHD: Increase Methylprednisolone to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pneumonia / bacteremia: Group B strep in blood, lung: continue
   Cefepime day [**8-17**] (d1 = [**4-29**]).  s/p 5 days azithromycin.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suctioning
    # Right upper extremity swelling: unclear why, since low platelets and
   liver function, but evaluate for thrombus with UE u/s
   NEG DVT
   # Infection / ID
   **Group B strep bacteremia: TTE negative for vegetations; TEE deferred
   [**3-7**] bleeding risk
   - continue cefepime 8/14 days today; last day [**5-11**]
   - s/p azithro
    **PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Dapsone 100 mg daily
    **CMV viremia: Continue gancyclovir, recheck viral loads weekly;
   unlikely causing lung / liver findings
    **Fungal PPx: Continue caspofungin
    # RENAL
   **HTN Persistently hypertensive. Likely volume playing a role in
   refractory HTN.
   - Labetolol 800mg TID; furosemide 60mg IV x1 to maintain -1L negative
   - Hydralazine 20 mg IV Q6H, amlodipine 10mg daily
   **ARF: Meds vs ATN (muddy brown casts).
   - SPEP, UPEP pending, 24H urine protein pending
   - Renal following
   - Renally dose meds, minimize cyclosporine
    **Uremia: unclear etiology. Probably secondary to worsening renal
   function and GI bleeding.
   - platelet transusions
   - consider DDAVP
   # GVHD: LIVER
   LFTs, esp T Bili increasing, raising concern for reactivation now w/
   decreased immunosuppression. Also consider TTP with LDH in the 1000
   this is unlikely all secondary to GVHD, likely mutliple etiologies.
   -          Continue ursodiol, mycophenylate mofetil, solumedrol 30 mg
   [**Hospital1 **], cyclosporine 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] (follow cyclosporine levels).
   -          Discuss increase immunosuppression w/ BMT
   - patient not good candidate for plasma exchange right now, already
   prednosone.
   # HEME / ONC
   **Multiple myeloma s/p cord transplant: STABLE.  Continue management

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and is currently intubated. The patient is on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis, and cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia. The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, right upper extremity swelling, infection, renal dysfunction, uremia, and GVHD of the liver. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/70 to 171/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving ventilator support and is weaning off sedation. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging studies reveal pulmonary edema and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's primary concern is hypoxia, which could be due to multiple etiologies such as GVHD in the lung with possible BOOP overlay, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or CM"

   FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**5-4**], the patient has taken
   a much
   poorer inspiration.  The opacifications have increased substantially,
   especially on the right.  Further fullness of the pulmonary vessels on
   the
   left again suggests that this represents primarily pulmonary edema.  Ho
   [**Last Name (un) **],
   the possibility of supervening infection can certainly not be excluded.

   Assessment and Plan
   54M h/o recurrent multiple myeloma s/p cord blood transplant admitted
   with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, on ganciclovir
   for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal PPx,
   cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia.
   # Hypoxia
   Multiple etiologies, however we are leaning toward GVHD in lung w/
   possible bronchiolitis obliterans overlay, causing obstructive
   process.  Also on ddx still is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  CMV
   pneumonia unlikely given stable viral load.  Although GBS in lung, w/
   low counts and now w/ adequate treatment unlikely causing this level of
   hypoxemia.
   Barriers to extubation:
   1) mouth bleeding: ENT packed mouth lesion, transfuse platelets to stop
   bleeding; mouth packing to be removed prior to extubation
   2) Mental status: will decrease sedation.  If not improve, will
   consider other etiologies, aka uremia.
   3) SBT
 to ? eval later today
   - Vent goal: back to [**6-8**].  GOAL: decrease sedation and attempt spon
   breathing trial
   - GVHD: Increased Methylprednisolone to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday;
   cyclosporine d/c

   - Pneumonia / bacteremia: Group B strep in blood, lung: continue
   Cefepime day [**9-17**] (d1 = [**4-29**]).  s/p 5 days azithromycin.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suctioning
    # Right upper extremity swelling
   Ultrasound NEG for DVT.  However, still suspicious for DVT esp given R
   subclav HICKMAN.
   ? bleeding, esp given plts and ecchymoses on RUE posteriorly.  Will ask
   rads to review study for hematoma, and consider further eval for clot,
   compartment syndrome.

    **CMV viremia: Continue gancyclovir, recheck viral loads weekly;
   unlikely causing lung / liver findings
    **Fungal PPx: Continue caspofungin
    # RENAL
   **HTN Persistently hypertensive. Likely volume playing a role in
   refractory HTN.
   - Labetolol 800mg TID; furosemide 60mg IV x1 to maintain -1L negative

   FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**5-5**], allowing for obliquity

   volumes with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, more marked on
    the
   right.  Tubes remain in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   54M h/o recurrent multiple myeloma s/p cord blood transplant admitted
   with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, on ganciclovir
   for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal PPx,
   cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia.
   # Hypoxia
   Multiple etiologies, however we are leaning toward GVHD in lung w/
   possible BOOP overlay, causing obstructive process.  Also on ddx still
   is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and CMV pneumonia.  Although GBS in
   lung, w/ low counts and now w/ adequate treatment unlikely causing this
   level of hypoxemia.  Per ID, unlikely that CMV is active in lung given
   relatively low recent CMV VL counts.
   - Vent goal: patient tolerated PSV 5/5 all day, will likely move up to
   [**11-11**] overnight, and possible SPT tomorrow.
   - will wean sedation
   - GVHD: Methylprednisolone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], MMF 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pneumonia / bacteremia: Group B strep in blood, lung: continue
   Cefepime day [**8-17**] (d1 = [**4-29**]).  s/p 5 days azithromycin.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suctioning
   - Mouth ulcers - packed
   # Right upper extremity swelling: unclear why, since low platelets and
   liver function, but evaluate for thrombus with UE u/s
   # Infection / ID
   **Group B strep bacteremia: TTE negative for vegetations; TEE deferred
   [**3-7**] bleeding risk
   - continue cefepime 9/14 days today, until [**5-13**]
   **PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Dapsone 100 mg daily
   **CMV viremia: Continue gancyclovir, recheck viral loads weekly;
   unlikely causing lung / liver findings
   **Fungal PPx: Continue caspofungin
    # RENAL
   **ARF: Meds vs ATN (muddy brown casts).
   CVVH
   - SPEP, UPEP pending, 24H urine protein pending
   - Renal following
   **HTN Persistently hypertensive. Likely volume playing a role in
   refractory HTN.
   - Labetolol 800mg TID; furosemide 60mg IV x1 to maintain -1L negative
   - Hydralazine 20 mg IV Q6H, amlodipine 10mg daily
   **Uremia: unclear etiology. Probably secondary to worsening renal
   function and GI bleeding.
   - platelet transusions
   - NO  DDAVP per heme
   # GVHD: LIVER
   LFTs, esp T Bili increasing, raising concern for reactivation now w/
   decreased immunosuppression. Also consider TTP with LDH in the 1000
   this is unlikely all secondary to GVHD, likely mutliple etiologies.
   -          Continue ursodiol, mycophenylate mofetil, solumedrol 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **],
   - patient not good candidate for plasma exchange right now, already
   prednosone.
   # HEME / ONC
   ? TTP
   Will resolve post cyclosporine; no need for pheresis
   **Multiple myeloma s/p cord transplant: STABLE.  Continue management
   per BMT recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and intubation. He is currently on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis, and cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia due to multiple etiologies, including GVHD in the lung with possible BOOP overlay, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and CMV pneumonia. There are also concerns about right upper extremity swelling, group B strep bacteremia, CMV viremia, ARF, refractory HTN, uremia, and liver involvement due to GVHD or TTP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and hypoxemia, which can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potentially result in respiratory arrest.
2. GVHD in the lung: GVHD can cause inflammation and damage to the lung tissue, leading to impaired gas exchange and worsening hypoxia.
3. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Bleeding into the alveoli can compromise oxygenation and may progress to respiratory failure.
4. CMV pneumonia: Infection with cytomegalovirus can cause severe pneumonia, leading to hypoxia and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old man with multiple myeloma complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), respiratory failure, renal failure, hemolysis, and continued depressed mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications that require careful management. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is already diagnosed with Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening respiratory symptoms.

2. Obstructive airways disease: The patient has a history of COPD and may be developing obliterative bronchiolitis. This can lead to further respiratory compromise. Monitoring of oxygenation and airway patency is crucial.

3. Alveolar hemorrhage: The patient has some alveolar hemorrhage complicating his other issues. Close monitoring for signs of worsening hemoptysis or respiratory distress is necessary.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to toxic effects of certain medications or ongoing bleeding. Renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures such as dialysis should be initiated as needed.

5. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient is experiencing GVHD, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Collaboration with the bone marrow transplant team is essential to optimize immunosuppression therapy.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. The patient's oral lesion was found by ENT and packed. Renal consult was requested, and sedation was temporarily held but did not result in full wakefulness. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation. No known drug allergies exist. The patient received antibiotics (cefipime and caspofungin) on 05/06 and 05/07. Fentanyl and midazolam infusions were also administered on 05/06. Other ICU medications include steroids and MMF, but no cyclosporine. The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted events.

Physical Examination:
The patient appears well-nourished with normal vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are ongoing. The patient's extremities show mild edema. Neurologic examination reveals responses to noxious stimuli and non-purposeful movement. Crackles and expiratory pushing are observed during chest examination.

Lab Results:
Blood tests indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), creatinine (Cr), liver enzymes (ALT and AST), bilirubin (T Bili), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lipase, amylase, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Electro"

   for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal PPx,
   cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia.
   # Hypoxia
   Multiple etiologies, however we are leaning toward GVHD in lung w/
   possible bronchioltis obliterans overlay, causing obstructive process.
   Also on ddx still is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Although GBS in
   lung, w/ low counts and now w/ adequate treatment unlikely causing this
   level of hypoxemia.  Per ID, unlikely that CMV is active in lung given
   relatively low recent CMV VL counts.
   - Vent goal: patient tolerated PSV 5/5 all day, possible SBT today.
   - sedation off since yesterday afternoon, assess MS ongoing
   - GVHD: Methylprednisolone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], MMF 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pneumonia / bacteremia: Group B strep in blood, lung: continue
   Cefepime day [**10-18**] (d1 = [**4-29**]).  s/p 5 days azithromycin.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suctioning
   - Mouth ulcers
 packed, will have ent remove pre extubation

   # Infection / ID
   **Group B strep bacteremia: TTE negative for vegetations; TEE deferred
   [**3-7**] bleeding risk

   **PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 1569**] dapsone 100 mg daily given relatively low G6PD
   **CMV viremia: Continue gancyclovir, recheck viral loads weekly;
   unlikely causing lung / liver findings
   **Fungal PPx: Continue caspofungin
    # RENAL
   **ARF:
   Unclear etiology.  W/ past hx of ATN from ? tacrolimus, foscarnet.
   Meds vs ATN (muddy brown casts).  Will pursue HD w/ renal w/ placing
   new HD catheter today.  Will infuse DDAVP to help w/ platelet
   dysfunction temporarily.
   - Renal following
   **HTN Persistently hypertensive. Likely volume playing a role in
   refractory HTN.
   - Labetolol 800mg TID; furosemide 60mg IV x1 to maintain -1L negative
   - Hydralazine 20 mg IV Q6H, amlodipine 10mg daily
   **Uremia: unclear etiology. Probably secondary to worsening renal
   function and GI bleeding.
   - platelet transusions
   - NO  DDAVP per heme
   ** I / O goal
   Even.   Will d/c lasix.
   # GVHD: LIVER
   LFTs, esp T Bili increasing, raising concern for reactivation now w/
   decreased immunosuppression. Also consider TTP with LDH in the 1000
   this is unlikely all secondary to GVHD, likely mutliple etiologies.
   - Continue ursodiol, mycophenylate mofetil, solumedrol 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # HEME / ONC
   ? TTP
   Will resolve post cyclosporine d/c; no need for pheresis.

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma post cord blood transplant, admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, intubated, on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal PPx, cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 100% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The ABG results show pH 7.39, PaCO2 47, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 162, indicating respiratory failure with hypoxemia. The patient's blood cultures are positive for group B strep bacteremia. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, renal failure, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Given the patient's low platelet count and ongoing bleeding, there is a risk of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage leading to further respiratory compromise.

2. Bronchiolitis obliterans: This is a potential complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation and can lead to chronic airflow obstruction and hypoxemia.

3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient has a history of GVHD, and there is a concern for acute GVHD involving the lungs, which can cause"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure, bacteremia, and intubation. The patient is currently on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis, and cefepime/azithromycin/vancomycin for group B strep in BAL/bacteremia. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with increased oxygen requirements and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. There are concerns about possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pulmonary embolism (PE), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's initial complaint and ongoing issue is hypoxemia, which requires continuous oxygen supplementation.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has low platelet counts and bleeding at the insertion site, indicating a possible coagulation disorder.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): With worsening respiratory status and evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities, PE should be considered as a potential cause of hypoxia.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening oxygen requirements and presence of fever suggest the possibility of VAP.
5. Acute Respiratory Distress"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old man with multiple myeloma who is now experiencing respiratory failure, renal failure, hemolysis, and a depressed mental status. He has worsened significantly since yesterday.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent alveolar hemorrhage: This is already occurring and could potentially worsen.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): There is a risk of developing new infections while on mechanical ventilation.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's CXR shows increased right-sided opacities, which could indicate a possible PE.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient is already showing signs of renal failure and is on hemodialysis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may not improve appropriately due to ongoing bleeding or sequestered bleeding sites.
7. Graft vs. host disease (GVHD): The patient has GVHD, which is a complication of stem cell transplantation. It can affect various organs and lead to further complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate treatment to manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with multiple myeloma and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), currently experiencing respiratory failure, renal failure, hemolysis, and depressed mental status. He has been worsening since yesterday. The causes of respiratory failure include Streptococcal pneumonia with bacteremia, obstructive airways due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and developing obliterative bronchiolitis, and alveolar hemorrhage. Other potential causes include recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and pulmonary embolism (PE), based on the chest X-ray (CXR). The patient is on various medications, including cefipime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, ganciclovir, and immunosuppressants. He also has acute renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient requires close monitoring and collaboration with the bone marrow transplant (BMT) team and infectious disease (ID) specialists for immunosuppression management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's history of alveolar bleeding increases the risk of recurrent bleeding episodes.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The CXR findings suggest a possible lung clot, which needs further"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He is currently admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, fungal prophylaxis, and bacteremia due to group B strep. He also has renal failure and is on hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD puts him at risk for exacerbations. Deep endotracheal aspirate growing gram-positive cocci suggests a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's FiO2 levels are fluctuating, indicating ongoing respiratory support issues.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient is on hemodialysis, indicating worsening renal function. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of acute renal failure, including possibilities such as nephritis or pulmonary/renal syndrome.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anti-platelet antibodies, HLA-antibody-mediated reaction, or cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (TTP). Fibrinogen levels are decreasing, but other coagulation studies are within normal limits.
4. CMV viremia: The patient has an elevated viral load, indicating active CMV infection. Ganciclovir has been held due to possible toxicity to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent cord blood transplantation. He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, fungal prophylaxis, group B strep in BAL/bacteremia, and renal failure on hemodialysis. The patient has several medical complications and is currently being treated with various medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing and requires mechanical ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH), Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), and Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Further diagnostic tests, such as a bronchoscopy, will help determine the exact cause and guide appropriate treatment.

2. HTN (Hypertension): The patient's blood pressure is elevated. Hydralazine has been administered as needed to control hypertension.

3. ARF with uremia: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, leading to uremia. The cause could be nephritis or pulmonary/renal syndrome. Additional tests, including CANCA, ANNA, anti-GBM, and reviewing renal records, are needed to identify the underlying cause.

4. Petechial/macular rash: The patient has developed a rash that could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or infection. Fibrinogen levels are decreasing, but DIC labs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, and a fungal infection. He is currently intubated and receiving ganciclovir for CMV viremia and caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis. The patient also has bacteremia and is being treated with cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin. He has been experiencing worsening hypoxia, and there is a concern for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Other potential complications include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires ongoing monitoring and management of his medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and worsening hypoxia, there is a risk of developing VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics covering Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) should be considered.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress could be due to a PE. Further evaluation with a V/Q scan or CT angiography may be necessary to rule out this complication.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   54-year-old man with multiple myeloma complicated by GVHD, now with
   respiratory failure, renal failure, hemolyis, and continued depressed
   mental status. He has worsened over the last two days.
   Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial
          Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia which we
   are day #11 on ABX
          Obstructive Airways: COPD+/- developing obliterative
   bronchiolitis.
          Some alveolar hemorrhage complicating his other issues (Hct
   has been stable)
          He remains critically ill.
   o         Differential includes recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, new VAP,
   PE (based on CXR).
   o         CTA has been evaluated.  LENIs are negative. Reassuring that
   the perfusion scan was grossly normal.
   o         Cefipime monotherapy for GBS x 14d, per ID
   o         Cipro for coverage of a broader range of GNR
   o         Vanco to cover MRSA (empiric)
   o         He is on ganciclovir for possible CMV.  Follow weekly
   VL.
   o         Do not see a compelling reason to bronch at this point
   (suctioning at this point only for old blood). Hct has been stable
   Vent management: he will need increased levels of PEEP (given either
   increased fluid: blood vs infection vs fluid, with fluid being most
   likely). He seems to have a PEEP responsive process.
   Goal PaO2 >55. Will try to HD (would like to effect a net neg state
   today, to get at whether his lungs are vol overloaded)
   Bacteremia (Beta Strep)
   -          Cefipime [**12-18**]
   -          Appreciate BMT
s help with titrating immunosuppression
   very challenging give his GVHD
   HTN:
   Hold antihypertensives.
   Acute Renal Failure: concering that he is now anuric ( since [**5-7**]). He
   may need CVHD
          DDx includes TTP (calcineurin-inhibitor-associated) and
   ATN.  Stopped offending meds
          Keep off calcineurin inhibitor
          He has some ongoing bleeding that may be partially a
   consequence of uremia.
          Now on hemodialysis.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to convert to CVVH today.
          Sent ANCA, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM all still pending
   Myeloma s/p transplant
   Graft vs. Host disease: LFTs stable.
   Continue to collaborate with BMT and ID regarding immunosuppression
   Continue steroids and MMF for now
   Thrombocytopenia
   keep > 50 for recent DAH and now oral bleeding. Will transfuse for Plts
   of 28 today.  His Hct seems to have been responding appropriately.
   Concerning for DIC, ? platelet antibody given multiple transfusions.
   Anemia
   Unclear why he did not bump appropriately to transfusions.  Could be
   alveolar hemorrhage; could be a sequestered bleeding site (e.g.
   retroperitoneal).  Will transfuse to HCT 25, Plt 50
   DIC workup (given petechial rash): negative so far.  Will cont to
   follow (coags normal)
   Other issues per ICU resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with multiple myeloma complicated by GVHD, now experiencing respiratory failure, renal failure, hemolysis, and continued depressed mental status. He has worsened over the last two days.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's Hct has been stable, indicating ongoing bleeding in the lungs.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The CXR shows increased hazy opacities throughout the right lung, which could be indicative of a possible PE.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but given the current condition, DKA should still be considered as a potential complication.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is anuric since [**5-7**], indicating a decline in kidney function.
6. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): Stopped offending medications, such as calcineurin inhibitors, should be evaluated for TTP.
7. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, making ATN a concern.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   54-year-old man with multiple myeloma complicated by GVHD which is
   likely progressing and possibly involving the lungs, with respiratory
   failure requiring high levels of mech vent support, renal failure-
   dialysis dependent, transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia (which is
   worse today), hemolyis, and continued depressed mental status. He has
   worsened over the last two days. Worsened opacification right lung.
   Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial
          Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia which we
   are day #11 on ABX
          Obstructive Airways: COPD+/- developing obliterative
   bronchiolitis.
          Some alveolar hemorrhage complicating his other issues (Hct
   has been stable)
          He remains critically ill.
   o         Differential includes recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, new VAP,
   PE (based on CXR).
   o         CTA has been evaluated.  LENIs are negative. Reassuring that
   the perfusion scan was grossly normal.
   o         Cefipime monotherapy for GBS x 14d, per ID
   o         Cipro for coverage of a broader range of GNR
   o         Vanco to cover MRSA (empiric)
   o         He is on ganciclovir for possible CMV.  Follow weekly
   VL.        (discuss with onc)
   o         Regarding consideration of bronch, FiO2 now at 0.8. I think
   the benefit is outweighed by the risk at this point (suctioning at this
   point only for old blood).
   Vent management: he will need increased levels of PEEP (given either
   increased fluid: blood vs infection vs fluid, with fluid being most
   likely). He seems to have a PEEP responsive process.
   Goal PaO2 >55. Will try to HD (would like to effect a net neg state
   today, to get at whether his lungs are vol overloaded)
   Bacteremia (Beta Strep)
   -          Cefipime [**12-18**]
   -          Appreciate BMT
s help with titrating immunosuppression
   very challenging give his GVHD
   HTN:
   Hold antihypertensives.
   Acute Renal Failure: concering that he is now anuric ( since [**5-7**]). He
   may need CVHD
          DDx includes TTP (calcineurin-inhibitor-associated) and
   ATN.  Stopped offending meds
          Keep off calcineurin inhibitor
          He has some ongoing bleeding that may be partially a
   consequence of uremia.
          Now on hemodialysis.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to convert to CVVH today.
          Sent ANCA, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM all still pending
   Myeloma s/p transplant
   Graft vs. Host disease: LFTs stable.
   Continue to collaborate with BMT and ID regarding immunosuppression
   Continue steroids and MMF for now
   Thrombocytopenia
   keep > 50 for recent DAH and now oral bleeding. Will transfuse for Plts
   of 28 today.  His Hct seems to have been responding appropriately.
   Concerning for DIC, ? platelet antibody given multiple transfusions.
   Also consider splenomegaly (sequestration given underlying liver
   failure)
   Anemia
   Unclear why he did not bump appropriately to transfusions.  Could be
   alveolar hemorrhage; could be a sequestered bleeding site (e.g.
   retroperitoneal).  Will transfuse to HCT 25, Plt 50
   DIC workup (given petechial rash): negative so far.  Will cont to
   follow (coags normal)
   Other issues per ICU resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with multiple myeloma who has been diagnosed with graft versus host disease (GVHD) and is experiencing respiratory failure, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and a depressed mental status. The patient's condition has worsened over the past two days.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's Hct (hematocrit) has been stable, but there is a possibility of ongoing bleeding in the lungs.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia.

3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's CXR (chest X-ray) shows increased hazy opacities throughout the right lung, which could indicate a potential PE.

4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has thrombocytopenia and ongoing bleeding, which may be indicative of DIC. Further investigation is needed.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric (not producing urine) since [**5-7**], indicating potential kidney failure. This may require continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH).

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which increase the risk of bleeding. Transfusion of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent cord blood transplant and is currently admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, renal failure on HD, and other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 162/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 14 cmH2O and FiO2 of 60%. The patient has scattered ecchymoses, lesions on the inner thigh transitioning to purple, dark macules, and icteric sclerae. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine level, and lactate dehydrogenase level. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. There are several potential causes for this condition, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), graft versus host disease (GVHD) with obliterative bronchiolitis, and underlying COPD. The patient's deep endotracheal aspirate is growing Gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a bacterial infection. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's underlying lung diseases and ongoing infection.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has renal failure as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and the need for hemodialysis (HD). The cause of ARF could be nephritis, pulmonary/renal syndrome, or uremia from gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigations such as cANCA, pANCA, and anti-GBM antibodies are pending to help determine the underlying cause. Management includes maintaining fluid balance during HD and addressing hypertension.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39 K/uL. The potential causes include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anti-platelet antibodies, HLA-antibody-mediated platelet destruction, or cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient's fibrinogen level is decreasing, but the FDP is negative, and the INR is within normal limits, making DIC less likely. Blood bank consultation for anti-platelet antibodies has been requested, and the patient is being followed by the BMT team.

4. CMV viremia: The patient has CMV viremia, and transition to foscarnet therapy has been planned. The"

   Disposition:icu
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent cord blood transplantation. The patient was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, fungal prophylaxis (caspofungin), group B strep in BAL/bacteremia (cefepime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin), and renal failure on HD.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and the growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the deep endotracheal aspirate indicate a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury. Weaning off FiO2 before PEEP and maintaining adequate oxygenation should be prioritized.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal failure is likely due to uremia from GI bleeding or nephritis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management with hemodialysis (HD) should be continued. Further investigations such as ANCA, pANCA, and anti-GBM antibodies should be considered.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anti-platelet antibodies, HLA-antibodies, or cyclosporine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and consultation with a blood bank is recommended.

4. CMV viremia: Transitioning to foscarnet therapy is appropriate for managing CMV viremia. Regular monitoring of ionized calcium levels post-dose and repletion as needed should be performed.

5. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): Atovaquone is prescribed for PCP prophylaxis. Assessment for other possible PCP medications should also be considered.

6. Hypertension: Hydralazine can be used for blood pressure control on an as-needed basis, especially during hemodialysis.

7. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient's stable condition indicates ongoing management with mycophenylate mofetil and methylprednisolone. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is essential.

8. Anemia: Transfusion should be considered for significant drops in hemoglobin concentration.

9. Fungal prophylaxis: Caspofungin should be continued for fungal prophylaxis.

10. Duodenitis: Lansoprazole can help manage duodenitis. Enterocort should be held due to gut inflammation.

11. Diabetes: Insulin in TPN is necessary for glycemic control.

In summary, the patient's main concerns include hypoxic respiratory failure, ARF, thrombocytopenia, CMV viremia, PCP prophylaxis, hypertension,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, fungal pneumonia, group B strep in BAL/bacteremia, and renal failure on HD. The patient's current condition is stable, but he has several ongoing medical complications that require attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and deep endotracheal aspirate growing GPC pose a risk for further respiratory complications. The differential diagnosis includes drug-induced pneumonitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), graft versus host disease (GVHD) with obliterative bronchiolitis, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).
2. Acute renal failure (ARF) with uremia: The patient's renal failure may be due to various causes such as nephritis, pulmonary/renal syndrome, or uremia from GI bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anti-platelet antibodies, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies, or cyclosporine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
4. CMV viremia: The"

   Microbiology: Endotracheal: 2+ gram pos cocci pairs, chains and

   Assessment and Plan
   54-year-old man with multiple myeloma complicated by GVHD which is
   likely progressing and possibly involving the lungs, with respiratory
   failure requiring high levels of mech vent support, renal failure-
   dialysis dependent, transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia, hemolyis,
   and continued depressed mental status. He is stable but critically ill
   from a ventilatory standpoint. . Worsened opacification right lung
   improved over past 24 hrs with HD.
   Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial
          Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia which we
   are day #12 on ABX
          Obstructive Airways: COPD+/- developing obliterative
   bronchiolitis.
          Some alveolar hemorrhage complicating his other issues (Hct
   has been stable and only old blood from tube)
          He remains critically ill.
   o         Differential includes recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, new VAP,
   PE (based on CXR).
   o         CTA has been evaluated.  LENIs are negative. Reassuring that
   the perfusion scan was grossly normal.
   o         Cefipime monotherapy for GBS x 14d, per ID
   o         Cipro for coverage of a broader range of GNR
   o         Vanco to cover MRSA (empiric)
   o         Changing to foscarnet for possible CMV.  Follow weekly VL.
   (discuss with onc)
   Vent management: he will need increased levels of PEEP (given either
   increased fluid: blood vs infection vs fluid, with fluid being most
   likely and he improved with HD). He seems to have a PEEP responsive
   process.
   Goal PaO2 >55. His CXr seemed to improve with Hd, but his gas exchnage
   remains very impaired. Will trial PEEP of 16 and will check a gas (cant
   place a esoph balloon given plts)
   Bacteremia (Beta Strep)
   -          Cefipime [**1-17**]
   -          Appreciate BMT
s help with titrating immunosuppression
   very challenging give his GVHD
   HTN:
   Restart labetalol today for HTN (goal SBP 140 mm Hg)
   Acute Renal Failure: concering that he is now anuric ( since [**5-7**]). He
   may need CVHD
          DDx includes TTP (calcineurin-inhibitor-associated) and
   ATN.  Stopped offending meds
          Keep off calcineurin inhibitor
          He has some ongoing bleeding that may be partially a
   consequence of uremia (unfortunately bleeding orally again with plts >
   50, may need to repack mouth)
          Now on hemodialysis (tolerated well yesterday)
          Sent ANCA, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM all still pending
   Myeloma s/p transplant
   Graft vs. Host disease: LFTs stable (bili 10.4 today)
   Continue to collaborate with BMT and ID regarding immunosuppression
   Continue steroids and MMF for now
   Thrombocytopenia
   keep > 50 for recent DAH and now oral bleeding. He has been havning
   diminished response to transfusion (? anti platelet antibody,
   sequestering, HLA Abs, TTP, DIC) work up pendiing. Blood bank aware,
   plt Ab pending. Cont to transfuse as he is actively bleeding in the
   mouth.
   Neutropenai: worsened over past few days, unclear etiology. Will
   discuss with BMT (f/u differential)
   Anemia
   Hct bumped appropriately (but was a delayed response).  Will transfuse
   to HCT 25, Plt 50
   DIC workup (given petechial rash): negative so far.  Will cont to
   follow (coags normal)
   Prophylaxis: changed to micafungin for prophylaxis per BMT.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with multiple myeloma who is experiencing several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, which may be due to a combination of factors such as pneumonia, obstructive airways disease (COPD), alveolar hemorrhage, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The differential diagnosis includes recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, new VAP, pulmonary embolism (PE), and COPD exacerbation.

2. Renal failure: The patient is on dialysis due to acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and medication-induced nephrotoxicity.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by a low platelet count. The workup is pending to determine the cause, which may include antiplatelet antibodies, sequestration, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies, TTP, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or other causes.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia requires transfusion to maintain appropriate hemoglobin levels. The cause of anemia is likely related to chronic disease or blood loss.

   Assessment and Plan
   54-year-old man with multiple myeloma complicated by GVHD which is
   likely progressing and possibly involving the lungs, with respiratory
   failure requiring high levels of mech vent support, renal failure-
   dialysis dependent, transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia, hemolyis,
   and continued depressed mental status. He is stable but critically ill
   from a ventilatory standpoint with increasing PEEP. Worsened
   opacification right lung improved over past 24 hrs with HD.
   Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial
          Streptococcal (Group B) pneumonia with bacteremia which we
   are day #12 on ABX
          Obstructive Airways: COPD+/- developing obliterative
   bronchiolitis.
          Some alveolar hemorrhage complicating his other issues (Hct
   has been stable and only old blood from tube)
   o         Differential includes recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, new VAP,
   PE (based on CXR).
   o         CTA has been evaluated.  LENIs are negative. Reassuring that
   the perfusion scan was grossly normal.
   o         Cefipime monotherapy for GBS x 14d, per ID
   o         Cipro for coverage of a broader range of GNR
   o         Vanco to cover MRSA (empiric)
   o         Changing to foscarnet for possible CMV.  Follow weekly VL.
   (discuss with onc)
   Vent management: he will need increased levels of PEEP (given either
   increased fluid: blood vs infection vs fluid, with fluid being most
   likely and he improved with HD). He seems to have a PEEP responsive
   process.
   Goal PaO2 >55. His CXr seemed to improve with Hd, but his gas exchnage
   remains very impaired. Will trial PEEP of 16 and will check a gas (cant
   place a esoph balloon given plts)
   Bacteremia (Beta Strep)
   -          Cefipime [**1-17**]
   -          Appreciate BMT
s help with titrating immunosuppression
   very challenging give his GVHD
   HTN:
   Restart labetalol today for HTN (goal SBP 140 mm Hg)
   Acute Renal Failure: concering that he is now anuric ( since [**5-7**]). He
   may need CVHD
          DDx includes TTP (calcineurin-inhibitor-associated) and
   ATN.  Stopped offending meds
          Keep off calcineurin inhibitor
          He has some ongoing bleeding that may be partially a
   consequence of uremia (unfortunately bleeding orally again with plts >
   50, may need to repack mouth)
          Now on hemodialysis (tolerated well yesterday)
          Sent ANCA, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM all still pending
   Myeloma s/p transplant
   Graft vs. Host disease: LFTs stable (bili 10.4 today)
   Continue to collaborate with BMT and ID regarding immunosuppression
   Continue steroids and MMF for now
   Thrombocytopenia
   keep > 50 for recent DAH and now oral bleeding. He has been havning
   diminished response to transfusion (? anti platelet antibody,
   sequestering, HLA Abs, TTP, DIC) work up pendiing. Blood bank aware,
   plt Ab pending. Cont to transfuse as he is actively bleeding in the
   mouth.
   Neutropenai: worsened over past few days, unclear etiology. Will
   discuss with BMT (f/u differential)
   Anemia
   Hct bumped appropriately (but was a delayed response).  Will transfuse
   to HCT 25, Plt 50
   DIC workup (given petechial rash): negative so far.  Will cont to
   follow (coags normal)
   Prophylaxis: changed to micafungin for prophylaxis per BMT.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with multiple myeloma complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He is currently experiencing respiratory failure requiring high levels of mechanical ventilation support, renal failure requiring dialysis, transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and depressed mental status. The patient also has a history of COPD, obstructive airways, alveolar hemorrhage, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), and septicemia caused by beta streptococcus.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to the progression of GVHD involving the lungs, development of new VAP or PE, recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, and further deterioration in the patient's mental status. There is also a concern for acute renal failure, especially since the patient has been anuric since [**5-7**] and may require continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVHD). The patient's thrombocytopenia is not responding well to transfusions, which could lead to continued bleeding and difficulty in managing his oral bleeding. Additionally, the neutropenia requires further evaluation, and the patient's anemia needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.

The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics (cefipime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin), antivirals (ganciclovir, fosc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and sedatives. Vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, normal heart rate, and respiratory rate. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 16 cmH2O. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,269 mL and output of 538 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid, as well as decreased white blood cell count and hemoglobin. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture results is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or anticoagulant therapy should be considered.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, increasing the risk of infection. Regular assessment and maintenance of line integrity are crucial.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Elevated levels of creatinine and decreased urine"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted with hypoxemia and acute respiratory failure. The patient continues to experience oral bleeding and peri-rectal bleeding, requiring rectal tube placement. His oxygen saturation drops during repositioning. The patient's ventilator settings were adjusted, but there was no significant improvement. The ID team switched the CMV treatment from ganciclovir to foscarnet.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, thrombocytopenia, CMV viremia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hypertension, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the liver, and pancytopenia/anemia/leukopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to various causes such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with obliterative bronchiolitis. Further diagnostic tests are needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to acute renal failure. This may be caused by nephritis, pulmonary/renal syndrome, or uremia from gastrointestinal bleeding."

   as pt is hypotensive)
   # Thrombocytopenia: ? DIC v anti-platelet Ab v HLA-antibody v
   cyclosporine-induced TTP.  Fibrinogen decreasing but FDP negative; INR
   WNL.  Unlikely DIC. Responded to plt tx yesterday with increase from 47
   to 82.  Now back to 58.  Will hold off on transfusing platelets as is
   not actively bleeding.
   - Blood bank consulted for anti plt antibodies.
   - BMT following
   -transfuse platelets as above (<50)
    # CMV viremia
   Transition to foscarnet yesterday with HD
   Will dose 50mg/ kg after HD on HD days only.
   At risk for electrolyte abnormalities (hypocalcemia, hypokalemia,
   hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia), continue to monitor peri-dosing and
   replete PRN.
   # PANCYTOPENIA / Anemia:
   Leukopenia: Likely med related, gancyclovir (has been switched to
   foscarnet), very concerning for sepsis, below baseline of ~3 with 8%
   bands on yesterday

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma (MM) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He has been admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His oxygenation has improved from yesterday's requirement of 100% FiO2 to the current level of 70%. He is also receiving vanc, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and foscarnet.

2. ARF with uremia: The patient has acute renal failure with uremia, which could be due to nephritis, pulmonary/renal syndrome, or gastrointestinal bleeding. His fluid status is positive, and he is on HD. Further evaluation is needed, including tests for anti-GBM antibodies, pANCA, cANCA, and anti-platelet antibodies.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be caused by DIC, anti-platelet antibodies, HLA-antibody, or cyclosporine-induced TTP. He has received platelet transfusion and is being monitored closely.

4. CMV viremia: The patient was transitioned to foscarnet therapy yesterday with HD. He will receive 50mg"

   - PE: Unlikely given negative DVT, V/Q scan, echo.
   - VAP: Cefepime  d13 (group B strep, pseudomonas), ciprofloxacin d5
   (GNR), vancomycin d5(MRSA); cont antibiotics. If no improvement in
   hypoximia by tomorrow, consider repeat bronch.
   - DAH: Transfuse plts<50 or ongoing bleeding, hct<25, will transfuse 1
   unit PRBCs and 1 unit platelets today as pt is actively bleeding from
   perirectal area and OP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He has had a complicated hospital course with hypoxemia, CMV viremia, and transfusion dependence. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 152/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a right toe with eschar and purulent drainage. He is receiving various medications including midazolam, lansoprazole, and others. Laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is being treated for suspected infections such as CMV viremia, fungal infection, and bacterial infection. The patient also has duodenitis and an oropharyngeal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD, deep endotracheal aspirate growing GPC, and lack of improvement on current vent settings indicate a potential complication of hypoxic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma (MM) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He has had a complicated hospital course characterized by hypoxemia, CMV viremia, and transfusion dependence. The patient is currently admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. He also has group B strep bacteremia, which is being treated with cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. The patient is also experiencing renal failure and is on hemodialysis (HD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and deep endotracheal aspirate growing GPC indicate the need for further evaluation and management to improve oxygenation and wean off mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has not shown significant improvement, it is necessary to reassess and consider repeating bronchoscopy.
3. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's active bleeding from the perirectal area and ongoing bleeding in the oral cavity may require platelet transfusion and packed red blood cell transfusion.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's low Hct levels and potential nephritis or pulmonary/renal syndrome need further investigation, including tests such as cANCA, pANCA, and anti-GBM antibodies.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He has been experiencing several complications during his hospital stay, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), hypoxemia, CMV viremia, acute renal failure (ARF), and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current condition is stable, but he is facing multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and deep endotracheal aspirate growing gram-positive cocci in pairs/clusters indicate a risk for pneumonia. This could be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or a different type of infection. Appropriate antibiotics should be continued, and a CT chest may be considered to evaluate for nodules suspicious for aspergillosis.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and the need for dialysis. The cause of ARF could be related to sepsis, nephritis, pulmonary/renal syndrome, or uremia from GI bleeding. Further investigations, such as anti-GBM antibodies and ANCA, should be done to identify the underlying cause.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anti"

   Assessment and Plan
   54M h/o MM s/p cord blood transplant with complicated post transplant
   hospitalization with CMV viremia and GBS bacteremia, hypoxic
   respiratory failure, renal failure, osteomyelitis, transfusion
   dependent.
    # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial. No evidence PE
   from LENIs, Q scan and ECHO.  Probably combination of pulmonary
   edema/fluid overload from renal failure, infection, ARDS, possible DAH
   although a bit far out for GVHD at this point and pt is heavily
   immunosuppressed.  Became more hypoxic after HD yesterday in setting of
   CXR looking less overloaded.
   -Continue respiratory management with current vent settings, can go up
   on Fi02 to 100% if needed, but respiratory measures not indicated.
   -No plan for bronch, too dangerous given coagulopathy
   -Continue antimicrobials: cefepime (completed 14 day course, now
   restarted on [**5-13**]) and cipro for GNR double coverage, vancomycin,
   amphotericin added yesterday for empiric aspergillosis coverage.
   -Continue to dialyze as aggressively as pt tolerates.
   -minimize fluid intake.  Ensure all meds concentrated.
   # ARF :  Pt did not tolerate goal of -4L during HD yesterday, still
   fluid positive.
   -f/u renal recs
   -plan to start CVVH today with aggressive fluid removal
   -d/w renal DDAVP in setting of thrombocytopenia, relative hypotension
   and uremia.
   -renally dose meds
   -d/c anti-htn meds
   # Thrombocytopenia: Responding less to transfusion.   Got 2 units
   yesterday, responded initially, now platelets back to 29.
   -2 units platelets for <50, active bleeding (GI and respiratory tracks)
   -f/u post transfusion CBC.
    # CMV viremia. VL trending down
   -Continue foscarnet (no ganciclovir for leukopenia)
   -monitor electrolytes  (at risk for low K, Mg, phos with foscarnet)
   # PANCYTOPENIA / Anemia:
   Leukopenia: Likely med related, gancyclovir (has been switched to
   foscarnet), very concerning for sepsis, with left shift, concerning as
   pt has active osteomyelitis. (see below)
   -f/u cultures
   -continue antibiotics  (completed cefepime, now on caspo, vanc, cipro)
   -gran count 591, will give GCSF IV x 3 days per BMT recs
   -f/u BMT recs
   Anemia: Transfusion criteria: HCT <25, >5pt drop, active bleeding.
   -1 unit PRBCs today for HCT 23.3, f/u post-tx HCT.
   # Toe infection: on exam had purulent right 4rd toe wound.
   -podiatry c/s appreciated.  Plan to follow from afar, no OR due to
   instability.
   -daily wound dsg per their recs.
   -continue vanc.
   # HTN:  d/c anti-htn regimen for now due to hypotension limiting HD
   fluid removal.
   # GVHD @ liver: LFTs improving slowly.
   -continue to check daily LFTs
   -will decrease steroids today to methlyprednisolone 30 [**Hospital1 **] per BMT
   recs.
   - Ursodiol, mycophenylate mofetil
    #OP bleed: Pt has been having slow bleed in oropharynx likely due to
   trauma s/p intubation.
   -appreciate ENT involvement, f/u recs
   -packing removed today, call if rebleeds
   -hold on mouth care for next few days.
   # MM s/p cord transplant: STABLE.  Mycophenylate mofetil,
   methylprednisolone.
   - BMT following
   - d/w family the overal prognosis, plan for discussion: will not broach
   extubation but will discuss CPR not indicated.  No further escalation
   of care beyond increase Fi02 in terms of respiratory support (no rescue
   measures).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a complicated post-transplant hospital course, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, hypoxic respiratory failure, renal failure, osteomyelitis, and transfusion dependence. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's respiratory status has not improved despite aggressive management, and there is concern for a possible clot in the endotracheal tube. CMV viral load is trending down but remains elevated. Platelet count continues to be low and unresponsive to transfusion.

The patient has anemia and leukopenia, likely due to medication side effects and sepsis. Renal function remains impaired, and the patient is dependent on dialysis. There is also evidence of fluid overload.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, duodenitis, and toe infection. GVHD is affecting the liver, with improving liver function tests. The patient has a history of myeloma and is post-cord blood transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and there is concern for further deterioration. Measures such as increasing FiO2 to 100% and considering continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be necessary.

2. Thrombocytopenia: Despite platelet transfusion, the patient's platelet count remains low"

Aggressive hemodialysis (HD) was performed today, resulting in some hypotension with dialysis, but no improvement in respiratory status. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is anticipated tomorrow. There are concerns about a possible clot in the endotracheal tube (ETT), and the patient's breathing is slightly discordant on the ventilator. The CMV viral load is 707, and the patient's platelet count has dropped to 30, necessitating the administration of two units of platelets.

   54M h/o MM s/p cord blood transplant with complicated post transplant
   hospitalization with CMV viremia and GBS bacteremia, hypoxic
   respiratory failure, renal failure, osteomyelitis, transfusion
   dependent.
    # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial. No evidence PE
   from LENIs, Q scan and ECHO.  Probably combination of pulmonary
   edema/fluid overload from renal failure, infection, ARDS, possible DAH
   although a bit far out for GVHD at this point and pt is heavily
   immunosuppressed.  Became more hypoxic after HD yesterday in setting of
   CXR looking less overloaded.
   -Continue respiratory management with current vent settings, can go up
   on Fi02 to 100% if needed, but respiratory measures not indicated.
   -No plan for bronch, too dangerous given coagulopathy
   -Continue antimicrobials: cefepime (completed 14 day course, now
   restarted on [**5-13**]) and cipro for GNR double coverage, vancomycin,
   amphotericin added yesterday for empiric aspergillosis coverage.
   -Continue to dialyze as aggressively as pt tolerates.
   -minimize fluid intake.  Ensure all meds concentrated.

   # Thrombocytopenia: Responding less to transfusion.   Got 2 units
   yesterday, responded initially, now platelets back to 29.
   -2 units platelets for <50, active bleeding (GI and respiratory tracks)
   -f/u post transfusion CBC.
    # CMV viremia. VL trending down
   -Continue foscarnet (no ganciclovir for leukopenia)
   -monitor electrolytes  (at risk for low K, Mg, phos with foscarnet)
   # PANCYTOPENIA / Anemia:
   Leukopenia: Likely med related, gancyclovir (has been switched to
   foscarnet), very concerning for sepsis, with left shift, concerning as
   pt has active osteomyelitis. (see below)
   -f/u cultures
   -continue antibiotics  (completed cefepime, now on caspo, vanc, cipro)
   -gran count 591, will give GCSF IV x 3 days per BMT recs
   -f/u BMT recs
   Anemia: Transfusion criteria: HCT <25, >5pt drop, active bleeding.
   -1 unit PRBCs today for HCT 23.3, f/u post-tx HCT.
   # Toe infection: on exam had purulent right 4rd toe wound.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and sedatives. The patient's family has decided to make him DNR (Do Not Resuscitate), meaning they do not want any heroic measures or increasing of vent settings. However, they also do not want to pull the vent or stop other therapy options. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has recently started granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). The patient's blood pressure has been dropping, and CVVH has been changed to no fluid off. The patient is afebrile, and all vital signs are stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently in the 60s, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the ventilator settings are not optimized or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungals, suggesting the presence of an ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance or"
