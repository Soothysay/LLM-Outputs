   Assessment and Plan: 30 y/o male with hx of alcohol abuse, without

   withdrawal after ""self-detox.""
   .
   # Alcohol withdrawal with ? seizure - pt presents with tremulousness,
   htn, tachycardia and hx c/w alcohol withdrawal.  Other items on ddx,
   though less likely, include infection, trauma, metabolic derangement,
   and/or other drug overdose. Received 200 mg IV thiamine in ED.  Patient
   also very agitated with 2 code purples called, and ultimately becoming
   violent towards nursing staff (kicking) requiring 4 point restraint.
   Patient demonstrated poor insight and judgement and did not have
   capacity to sign out AMA.  Per psychiatry ok to use haldol prn but
   follow QTc
   - plan to use long acting benzo (valium 5-10 mg IV for CIWAS > 10) to
   tx psychomotor agitation and prevent progression to major withdrawal
   sx.
   - cont thiamine and folate, MVI
   - repeat EKG in AM to monitor QTc
   - social work consult in AM
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes - AST, ALT, T bili slightly elevated but INR
   normal. AST/ALT ratio of 2:1 c/w alcohol. Also on ddx is seroquel-
   induced transaminitis (less likely).
   - RUQ performed to evaluate potential obstructive biliary picture,
   though suspect this is related to #2 above. RUQ neg for acute
   obstruction, fatty liver noted on prelim read.
   - outpt hepatitis serologies
   - will check conjugated and unconjugated fraction. Will trend T bili
   with hydration.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - ddx includes splenic sequestration in this pt with
   alcohol history vs. ITP vs medication induced. Plt noted to be 245 in
   [**2128**] and 127 in [**2130**]. Of note, I have not noted any recent heparin
   administration. No evidence of hemolysis or DIC with normal coag
   profile.  Pt had dark [**Year (4 digits) **]+ stool likely from alcoholic gastritis, Hct
   and hemodynamics stable
   - will continue to monitor, consider abdominal US to eval for
   splenomegaly.
   - Crit stable.

   # HTN - at baseline, and likely contributor is alcohol withdrawal, as
   noted. Will tx underlying cause with benzos, and cont home regimen, as
   tolerated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including tremulousness, hypertension, tachycardia, and a possible seizure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), slightly elevated total bilirubin, and a normal INR. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 40 K/uL. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has been agitated and violent towards nursing staff, requiring restraints. The patient has been started on IV diazepam for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and will receive thiamine and folate supplementation. The patient's QTc interval will be monitored, and he will be evaluated for potential obstructive biliary picture. An abdominal ultrasound may be performed to evaluate for splenomegaly. The patient's blood products and fluid balance are being closely monitored. The patient is currently in the ICU and is expected to be transferred to the floor tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alcohol withdrawal with possible seizures: The patient is at risk of developing severe complications from alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens, hallucinations, fever, and seizures. Close monitoring and administration of benzodiazepines are necessary to manage these symptoms.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could be due to various causes such as splenic sequestration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including tremulousness, hypertension, tachycardia, and a possible seizure. The patient has been agitated and violent, requiring restraints, and demonstrated poor insight and judgment. The patient's platelet count has been declining, and he has experienced dark stools likely due to alcoholic gastritis. Other potential complications include elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and possible infection or trauma. The patient is currently receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal, including benzodiazepines and haloperidol, as well as continued administration of thiamine and folate. Further evaluation and management are planned to address the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, including tremulousness, hypertension, tachycardia, and a possible seizure. It is important to monitor and manage these symptoms to prevent progression to more severe withdrawal symptoms.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been declining, which can be concerning. The cause of thrombocytopenia may include splenic sequestration due to alcohol abuse, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), or medication-induced effects. Close monitoring is necessary to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
3. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including tremulousness, hypertension, tachycardia, and a possible seizure. The patient has been aggressive and violent, requiring restraints, and demonstrates poor insight and judgment. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and potential electrolyte and fluid disorders. The patient is also a smoker and has slightly elevated bilirubin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal with possible progression to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), or hallucinations.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to alcohol abuse increases the risk of infections.
3. Trauma: Aggressive behavior and restraints can lead to physical injuries.
4. Metabolic derangement: Elevated liver enzymes indicate possible liver damage, which may contribute to metabolic disturbances.
5. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: Imbalances in electrolytes and fluids can occur due to alcohol withdrawal and poor nutritional status.
6. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count may indicate potential bleeding complications.
7. Nicotine withdrawal: As the patient is a smoker, abrupt cessation of nicotine can result in withdrawal symptoms.
8. Potential obstructive biliary picture: Elevated liver enzymes and fatty liver noted on imaging raise concerns about potential liver complications.
9. Splenic sequestration: Thrombocytopenia"

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including tremulousness, hypertension, tachycardia, and a seizure. The patient also shows signs of agitation, requiring two code purples and eventually becoming violent towards nursing staff, necessitating four-point restraints.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) with an AST/ALT ratio of 2:1, which is consistent with alcohol-induced liver damage. The patient's INR is normal, ruling out significant liver dysfunction at this time. The patient's platelet count is low, but there are no signs of hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 148/107 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 36.7°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the HEENT, lungs, CV, abdomen, or extremities. However, the patient is described as alert but oriented only to person, not place or time.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink. It is"

   Assessment and Plan
   30 y/o male with hx of alcohol abuse, without prior DTs/seizures, now
   presents with ? seizure in setting of alcohol withdrawal after
   ""self-detox.""
   .
   # Alcohol withdrawal with ? seizure - pt presents with tremulousness,
   htn, tachycardia and hx c/w alcohol withdrawal.  Other items on ddx,
   though less likely, include infection, trauma, metabolic derangement,
   and/or other drug overdose. Received 200 mg IV thiamine in ED.  Patient
   also very agitated with 2 code purples called, and ultimately becoming
   violent towards nursing staff (kicking) requiring 4 point restraint.
   Patient demonstrated poor insight and judgement and did not have
   capacity to sign out AMA.  Per psychiatry ok to use haldol prn but
   follow QTc
   - plan to use long acting benzo (valium 5-10 mg IV for CIWAS > 10) to
   tx psychomotor agitation and prevent progression to major withdrawal
   sx.
   - cont thiamine and folate, MVI
   - repeat EKG to monitor QTc
   - social work consult ordered
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes - AST, ALT, T bili slightly elevated but INR
   normal. AST/ALT ratio of 2:1 c/w alcohol. Also on ddx is seroquel-
   induced transaminitis (less likely).
   - RUQ performed to evaluate potential obstructive biliary picture,
   though suspect this is related to #2 above. RUQ neg for acute
   obstruction, fatty liver noted on prelim read.
   - outpt hepatitis serologies
   - will check conjugated and unconjugated fraction. Will trend T bili
   with hydration.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - ddx includes splenic sequestration in this pt with
   alcohol history vs. ITP vs medication induced vs direct toxic effect of
   EtOH on bone marrow. Plt noted to be 245 in [**2128**] and 127 in [**2130**]. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC with normal coag profile.  Pt had dark
   heme+ stool likely from alcoholic gastritis, Hct and hemodynamics
   stable
   - will continue to monitor
   - Crit stable.
   .
   # HTN - at baseline, and likely contributor is alcohol withdrawal, as
   noted. Will tx underlying cause with benzos, and cont home regimen, as
   tolerated.
   # Cigarette use
   - On nicotine patch.
   - Nicotine gum available.
   # FEN: mIVF @ 100 ml/hr x1000cc, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   when no longer in restraints
   # Code: full

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, including tremulousness, hypertension, tachycardia, and a seizure. The patient has also demonstrated violent behavior towards nursing staff, requiring restraints. The medical team is considering the possibility of other conditions such as infection, trauma, metabolic derangement, or drug overdose.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), slightly elevated total bilirubin, normal INR, and thrombocytopenia. These findings suggest potential liver damage, possibly due to alcohol abuse. The patient's platelet count has been decreasing over time, which could be indicative of various causes including splenic sequestration, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), medication-induced, or direct toxic effect of alcohol on the bone marrow.

The patient's vital signs indicate hypertension and tachycardia, which may be attributed to alcohol withdrawal. Other assessments and plans include the need for social work consult, monitoring of QTc interval, continuation of thiamine and folate supplementation, and consideration for long-acting benzodiazepine (Valium) to manage psychomotor agitation and prevent progression to major withdrawal symptoms.

The patient's nutritional plan includes maintenance intravenous fluids (mIVF) at 100 ml/hr x1000cc, repletion of electrolytes, and a regular diet"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note. The 24-hour events include a Code Purple where the patient attempted to leave and became violent, requiring restraints. The patient also displayed agitation and had to be restrained again. Haldol was recommended for agitation, while reserving Ativan for withdrawal symptoms. The patient was tachycardic with a heart rate in the 160s and labetalol was ordered to be given, which improved the heart rate.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and amoxicillin, both causing rashes. The last dose of antibiotics given was levofloxacin on [**2132-5-16**] at 11:50 PM.

The infusions mentioned are diazepam (Valium) started on [**2132-5-18**] at 10:40 AM and haloperidol (Haldol) started on [**2132-5-19**] at 02:00 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   30 y/o male with hx of alcohol abuse, without prior DTs/seizures, now
   presents with ? seizure in setting of alcohol withdrawal after
   ""self-detox.""
   .
   # Alcohol withdrawal with ? seizure - pt presents with tremulousness,
   htn, tachycardia and hx c/w alcohol withdrawal.  Other items on ddx,
   though less likely, include infection, trauma, metabolic derangement,
   and/or other drug overdose. Received 200 mg IV thiamine in ED.  Patient
   also very agitated with 2 code purples called, and ultimately becoming
   violent towards nursing staff (kicking) requiring 4 point restraint.
   Patient demonstrated poor insight and judgement and did not have
   capacity to sign out AMA.  Per psychiatry ok to use haldol prn but
   follow QTc
   - plan to use long acting benzo (valium 5-10 mg IV for CIWAS > 10) to
   tx psychomotor agitation and prevent progression to major withdrawal
   sx.  Only required 5 mg valium o/n.
   - cont thiamine and folate, MVI
   - repeat EKG to monitor QTc
   - social work consult ordered
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes - AST, ALT, T bili slightly elevated but INR
   normal. AST/ALT ratio of 2:1 c/w alcohol. Also on ddx is seroquel-
   induced transaminitis (less likely).
   - RUQ performed to evaluate potential obstructive biliary picture,
   though suspect this is related to #2 above. RUQ neg for acute
   obstruction, fatty liver noted on prelim read.
   - outpt hepatitis serologies
   - will check conjugated and unconjugated fraction. Will trend T bili
   with hydration.
   - t bili slightly rising; will follow.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 improving.  Ddx includes splenic sequestration in
   this pt with alcohol history vs. ITP vs medication induced vs direct
   toxic effect of EtOH on bone marrow. Plt noted to be 245 in [**2128**] and
   127 in [**2130**]. No evidence of hemolysis or DIC with normal coag profile.
   Pt had dark heme+ stool likely from alcoholic gastritis, Hct and
   hemodynamics stable
   - will continue to monitor
   - Crit stable.
   .
   # HTN - at baseline, and likely contributor is alcohol withdrawal, as
   noted. Will tx underlying cause with benzos, and cont home regimen, as
   tolerated.
   # Cigarette use
   - On nicotine patch.
   - Nicotine gum available.
   # FEN: stop IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet when no longer in
   restraints
   # Code: full

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including tremulousness, hypertension, tachycardia, and a possible seizure. He has been agitated and violent, requiring restraints. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he has received treatment for alcohol withdrawal with Valium. Thiamine and folate supplementation have been initiated, along with monitoring of QTc on EKG. Social work consult has been ordered. 

The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, specifically AST and ALT, with a slightly elevated total bilirubin. This could be indicative of alcoholic liver disease. An RUQ was performed to evaluate for potential obstructive biliary picture, but it was negative. Outpatient hepatitis serologies will be checked, and the conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin will be measured. The trend of total bilirubin will be followed.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is improving. The differential diagnosis includes splenic sequestration, ITP, medication-induced thrombocytopenia, and direct toxic effect of alcohol on the bone marrow. The platelet count has been noted to be 245 in [**2128**] and 127 in [**2130**]. There is no evidence of hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with normal coagulation profile.

The patient has a history of hypertension"
