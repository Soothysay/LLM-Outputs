   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   -
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in placefor medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating but
   bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes. The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening hypoxemia, which necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. This indicates respiratory failure, and continued monitoring of oxygenation and ABG is recommended.

2. Mental Status Changes: The patient exhibits mental status changes, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or active infection. Monitoring in the ICU for airway protection and oxygenation is essential. Treatment includes lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin, and serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs.

3. Liver Failure: The patient's INR is elevated at 2.9, and bilirubin levels are rising, indicating liver failure. Further evaluation of hepatitis serologies, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and continued monitoring of liver labs are necessary.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. Urine sodium is low at 29, indicating possible pre-renal azotemia. IVF boluses and pRBC transfusion have been given with no improvement. The patient is anuric at this time. A renal consult and consideration of dialysis if indicated should be"

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxemia and has been intubated. Close monitoring of ABG values and oxygenation is necessary to ensure adequate respiratory support.

2. Mental Status Changes: The patient is showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which may require continued lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, and rifaximin. Monitoring in the ICU for airway protection and oxygenation is essential.

3. Liver Failure: The patient has an elevated INR and rising bilirubin levels, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. Further evaluation with hepatitis serologies and MELD scoring is recommended. Paracentesis may be necessary if ascites develops.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has hepatorenal syndrome with anuria and a low urine output. Fluid boluses and consideration of dialysis should be discussed with the renal consult team.

5. Anemia: The patient is menstruating, but it is unclear if she has any GI bleeding or esophageal/gastric varices. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and transfusion as needed is important.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   -
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in placefor medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating but
   bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, mental status changes, and worsening renal failure consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She is also anemic and has acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxemia necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. It is important to continue adjusting the AC settings and obtain an arterial blood gas (ABG) to monitor oxygenation.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or an active infection. Monitoring in the ICU for airway protection and oxygenation is crucial. Continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, and rifaximin therapy, as well as serial labs to monitor coagulation and liver function tests.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating impaired liver function. Folate supplementation and vitamin K therapy should be continued, and hepatitis serologies, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and MELD score should be evaluated.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has hepatorenal syndrome. Urine sodium levels are low, indicating renal dysfunction. IV fluid boluses and packed red blood cell transfusion have been administered, but"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Likely due to pulmonary
   edema given chest XR.   Unable to get fluid off.  Will discuss with
   hepatology, but HD probably does not make sense given overall
   prognosis.   Abdomon is not distended or tense, but could consider
   tapping to
   remove fluid
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME.  Poor urine output.  Prognosis likely very
   poor.  Urine Na slightly elevated for HRS.  Will check back in her
   records if
   she got a dye load or something else to explain ARF.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC:  High bili, very poor synthetic
   function.
   Anemia:  Hct stable despite 1U.  Can guaiac stool.
   HTN:  BP stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU due to worsening liver failure and renal failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 80%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, crackles in both lungs, edema in both lower extremities, and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Neurologically, the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds inadequately. Lab results show low hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets, as well as elevated creatinine and liver enzymes. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently being managed for respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and complications related to cirrhosis of the liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema. This condition can worsen if fluid management is not optimal or if there are further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has poor urine output, suggesting acute kidney injury. HRS is a potential complication"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   Likely component due to volume overload (very little UOP and positive
   fluid balance of 3 L yesterday).
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 today is day #2)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   - Check with [**Hospital6 707**] re: any recent dye/contrast
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   today) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute liver failure and mental status changes. She now shows signs of worsening renal failure consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening hypoxemia and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. This may be due to volume overload.

2. Mental Status Changes: The patient is experiencing mental status changes, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or an active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of alcoholism and acute liver failure.

3. Liver Failure: The patient has elevated INR, rising bilirubin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. This indicates ongoing liver dysfunction and potential progression to more severe liver failure.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing hepatorenal syndrome, as evidenced by worsening renal function despite IV fluid boluses and blood transfusion. Anuria (lack of urine production) is also noted.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but the cause is unclear. It could be related to gastrointestinal bleeding or menstruation.

6. Hypertension: Although the patient is currently normotensive, she has a history of hypertension, and it may reoccur.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage these potential complications accordingly."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2147-4-24**] 08:42 PM
   - Renal recs: likely ATN (less likely prerenal/HRS); agree w/albumin;
   no urgent need for RRT but will consider in next 1-2 days (need GOC
   discussion first); give Na bicarb as needed for metabolic acidosis;
   dose vanc by levels.
   - Pt given albumin and bicarb.
   - Received 1 unit pRBC at 10am
   - Plan for dialysis [**4-25**]; temp HD line to be placed by IR [**4-25**] with FFP
   prior (goal INR = 1.5). Call IR at 7:15am for schedule and confirm FFP
   dosing.
   - Liver recs: treat fungal UTI; start prednisone 40 mg (day 1 = [**4-24**]);
   encourage nutrition (low-dose tube feeds); vitamin K X 3 days; albumin
   2X50g/day, octreotide/midodrine NOT necessary.
   - Octreotide/midodrine stopped.
   - Started on prednisone for acute alcoholic hepatitis (discriminant
   function 137!).
   - per ID abx approval fellow, holding off on micafungin/fluconazole for
   now given yeast in urine likely contaminant; will repeat U/A and cx.
   If we do decide to treat her UTI, fluconazole has better GU penetration
   than micafungin and neither has been shown to be less hepatotoxic than
   the other.
   - Poor UOP throughout day
   - Unable to place A-line - aborted further attempts given high INR and
   risk of hematoma(patient received only 1 unit FFP prior to procedure).

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   Likely component due to volume overload (very little UOP and positive
   fluid balance of 3 L yesterday).
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 today is day #2)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   - Check with [**Hospital6 707**] re: any recent dye/contrast
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   today) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, mental status changes, and worsening renal failure consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/50 mmHg to 127/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's neurological status is altered, and she requires airway protection.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening hypoxemia despite being on mechanical ventilation. This could be due to volume overload, as indicated by minimal urine output and a positive fluid balance of 3 L yesterday. Further attempts at placing an arterial line should be made, and ABG should be obtained. The patient may benefit from pressure support ventilation (PSV) when tolerated.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient exhibits mental status changes, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or an active infection. Given the patient's history of alcoholism and acute liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy is a possibility. Prognosis is poor, according to the liver team, considering the trend"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line attempted to be placed yesterday for ABGs; unsuccessful and
   will ask IR to place line today while getting HD line
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - HD likely today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   2. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - hypotension likely will improve with HD as volume overload is treated
   - consider radial a line today
   - start levophed as necessary for MAP >55
   - 100grams albumin today
   .
   3. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by levels; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - Dophoff tube migrated, will need to replace or place OG tube for
   nutrition/meds
   .
   4. Liver Failure: INR is 3.6 after 1 unit FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 [**4-25**] is day #3)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   5. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (received alb on [**3-8**] PM, [**4-25**] AM)
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery. Plan for dialysis today. For access we are
   coordinating with IR and renal, will need FFP to reverse coagulopathy
   prior to placement.
   .
   6. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate increase in Hct;
   transfuse for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   7. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Replace foley with treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, hypotension, and anemia. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has a positive fluid balance of 4 L for the LOS and very little urine output. The laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy with an INR of 3.6. Renal function is impaired, and the patient has a serum creatinine level of 6.2 mg/dL. There are also indications of a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) with yeast in the urine culture. The patient has been started on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible infectious etiology, and prednisone for acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there are concerns about worsening mental status and volume overload. It is important to optimize ventilation settings, manage fluid balance, and consider hemodialysis to improve respiratory status.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, and efforts should be made to maintain an adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) >"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line attempted to be placed yesterday for ABGs; unsuccessful and
   will ask IR to place line today while getting HD line
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - HD likely today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by levels; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 3.6 after 1 unit FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 [**4-25**] is day #3)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery. Plan for dialysis likely today; renal will
   re-eval pt in afternoon after receives temporary HD line by IR. Pt will
   need FFP and ?cryo prior to line placement for INR <1.5.
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate increase in Hct;
   transfuse for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   6. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   .
   7. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, mental status changes, and worsening renal function. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction. She also has anemia, and there is a possibility of a urinary tract infection. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to volume overload and worsening mental status. Intubation and mechanical ventilation have been initiated to support her respiratory function.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of acute liver failure. Close monitoring for airway protection and oxygenation is necessary.
3. Hepatitis: The patient's hepatitis serologies should be followed up, and additional tests such as anti-smooth muscle antibody may be considered to determine the underlying cause of liver failure.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but HRS cannot be completely ruled out. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis, may be required, and the patient's renal function should be closely monitored.
5. Anemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line attempted to be placed yesterday for ABGs; unsuccessful and
   will ask IR to place line today while getting HD line
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - HD likely today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by levels; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 3.6 after 1 unit FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 [**4-25**] is day #3)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (received alb on [**3-8**] PM, [**4-25**] AM)
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery. Plan for dialysis likely today; renal will
   re-eval pt in afternoon after receives temporary HD line (and possibly
   A-line) by IR. Pt will need FFP prior to line placement for INR <1.5.
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate increase in Hct;
   transfuse for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   6. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   .
   7. Hypotension. History of hypertension, but currently hypotensive to
   normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - hypotension likely will improve with HD as volume overload is treated
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, NPO pending clinical resolution

   # Access: R arm power PICC

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, mental status changes, worsening renal failure, and respiratory failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient's condition is complicated by volume overload, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatotoxicity, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and possible urinary tract infection (UTI) with yeast infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to the presence of volume overload and worsening mental status.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient exhibits mental status changes, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. There is a possibility of further deterioration in mental status if the underlying cause is not addressed.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has acute liver failure with elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy. There is a risk of continued liver deterioration and potential progression to fulminant hepatic failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is a risk of further renal deterioration and potential need for dialysis.
5. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which may be due to volume overload and hepatotoxicity. There is a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of ethanol hepatitis and renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been treated with steroids and scheduled to receive a hemodialysis catheter for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient has allergies to Demerol and unknown allergies. She has received antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) within the last 24 hours. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing worsening hypoxemia likely due to fluid overload. She also has poor urine output, indicating worsening renal failure. The patient is being treated for liver failure and encephalopathy with medications such as ceftriaxone, prednisone, lactulose, and rifaximin. She has a yeast infection in her urine, which will be treated with fluconazole. The patient is anemic and will be monitored for signs of bleeding. The patient's overall condition is critical, and she requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by worsening hypoxemia. This can lead to decreased oxygen supply to vital organs and may result in further deterioration of organ function.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake-output balance, indicating fluid overload. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema, cardiac complications, and worsen renal function.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line placed for ABGs- Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - continued CVVH  today to remove volume will likely improve
   respiratory status
   .
   2. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - hypotension likely will improve with HD as volume overload is treated
   - continue levophed for MAP >55; wean as tolerated
   .
   3. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - Dophoff tube migrated, will need to replace or place OG tube for
   nutrition/meds
   .
   4. Liver Failure: INR is improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of
   FFP yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**]
   lab data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   5. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - patient with HD catheter placed by renal service yesterday, now on
   CVVH.
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated.
   .
   6. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   7. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Replace foley with treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute liver failure and mental status changes. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast and is suspected to have a urinary tract infection. She also has renal failure, anemia, and potential complications related to her liver failure, such as hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate due to volume overload and worsening mental status. This could lead to further hypoxia and potential ARDS.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may persist or worsen due to fluid overload and impaired cardiac function secondary to liver failure. This could lead to shock and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. If not properly managed, this condition can progress and lead to increased levels of ammonia in the blood, causing severe brain dysfunction.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's worsening renal function suggests the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome. If left untreated, this condition can progress to end-stage renal disease.
5. Infection: The presence of yeast in the urine and blood culture indicates a possible infection. If not appropriately treated, this infection could wors"

   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - Dophoff tube migrated, will need to replace or place OG tube for
   nutrition/meds
   .
   #. Liver Failure: INR is improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of
   FFP yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Replace foley today

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient also has hypotension, likely due to volume overload and worsening renal failure consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There is a need for ongoing monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin. Monitoring coagulation parameters and liver function tests is essential.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressor support. Blood products may be necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being used to remove volume and improve renal function.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or menstruation. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding is necessary, and transfusion of packed red blood"

   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line placed for ABGs; trend ABGs
   - attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (now at 18;
   will decrease to 15)
   - continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, mental status changes, and worsening renal failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and respiratory failure. She has positive fluid balance, edema, and jaundice. Her lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction. She has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin. The patient's prognosis is poor given the trend in her liver function tests and coagulation profile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires pressor support to maintain MAP >60. There is a risk of ongoing hypotension and potential shock.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. There is a risk of further deterioration in mental status.
4. Liver Failure: The patient has acute liver failure with elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy. There is a risk of continued liver dysfunction and potential hepatic necrosis.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal failure with anuria and elevated creatinine"

   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 12);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - A-line placed for ABGs; trend ABGs
   - attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of FFP [**4-25**].  Bilirubin now
   trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)

   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated

   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture today; if yeast persist, continue tx with
   fluconazole

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute liver failure and mental status changes, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She has a positive fluid balance of 4 L for the length of stay, indicating volume overload. The patient's renal function is also impaired, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). 

The patient has been started on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated due to possible infectious etiology. Prednisone has been started per liver team recommendation. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation profile are being monitored closely, and she has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions to correct coagulopathy. 

Anemia management includes monitoring for signs of bleeding and transfusing packed red blood cells (pRBCs) as needed to maintain a hemoglobin concentration of at least 24 g/dL. 

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected, and treatment with fluconazole has been initiated based on the presence of yeast in the initial urinalysis. 

The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding at 25 mL/hour. Glycemic control is also being maintained.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes.
- She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The cause of respiratory failure is likely volume overload and worsening mental status.
- The patient's blood pressure is managed with levophed and blood products as needed.
- Mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, but other causes such as medication effects or active infection should also be considered.
- The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) rather than hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Urine sodium is 29, and the patient has received IVF boluses and one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) without improvement in renal function.
- Anemia is present, but the cause is unknown. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and transfusing for a goal hematocrit (HCT) > 24 is recommended.
- A possible urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected due to initial urinalysis (U/A) showing yeast and culture growing yeast. Treatment with renally-adjusted fluconazole is initiated.
- Fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance are present, and the patient has been placed on nothing by mouth (NPO) status with an or"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 12);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place)
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - Continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinue propofol today and monitor mental status (restart if
   patient appears uncomfortable)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**]); will discontinue
   today [**4-27**] given no clear infectious source and elevated WBC likely
   secondary to steroids
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes; add on differential to
   morning labs
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of FFP [**4-25**].  Bilirubin now
   trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely due to volume overload and worsening mental status. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being used to remove volume and improve respiratory status.

2. Hypotension: The patient continues to have hypotension, for which levophed is being given for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60. Blood products may be given as needed.

3. Mental Status Changes: These changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, although other causes such as medication effects or active infection should also be considered. Lactulose and rifaximin are being continued, while propofol is being discontinued.

4. Liver Failure: The patient has secondary liver failure due to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR has improved after 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Hepatitis serologies show no acute infection.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection. The patient's current condition is stable, with controlled vital signs and adequate oxygenation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O. The arterial line was temporarily removed due to movement of the patient but was replaced. The patient continues on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Allergies include Demerol (Oral). The patient received antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone and vancomycin, within the last 24 hours. Infusions include norepinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/min and propofol at 10 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission. Review of systems remains unchanged except as noted below.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's temperature (Tmax) is 37.5°C (99.5°F) and the current temperature is also 37.5°C (99.5°F). Heart rate (HR) is 64 beats per minute, with a normal range of 57-72 bpm. Blood pressure (BP) is 109/53 mmHg,"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   - consider possible infection/sepsis given difficulty weaning off
   levophed on CVVH and leukocytosis (though may be secondary to steroids
   as it is temporally related); will obtain blood cultures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets decreased this morning and fibrinogen
   less than detectable and markedly elevated fibrin degradation products.
   Likely represents DIC though difficult to differentiate from alcoholic
   hepatitis while on CVVH.
   - Received cryoprecipitate X2 this morning [**4-28**].
   - Monitor DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]; goal fibrinogen > 100
   - Obtain blood smear
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - All antibiotics discontinued [**4-27**] given no clear infectious source
   (vanco day 1 = [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated, goal TBB today [**4-28**]
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for goal HCT > 24; will get one unit pRBCs this morning
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - received vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   for 5 day course started [**4-25**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, presenting with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and respiratory failure. She has hypotension and is receiving vasopressors. Her platelet count is decreasing, and she has elevated fibrin degradation products, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and possible urinary tract infection (UTI) with yeast growth in urine culture. She has acute renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Her liver function tests (LFTs) are worsening, and she has a high discriminant function score, indicating poor prognosis. She is being treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin. She has a MELD score of 45 and is being considered for liver transplantation. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to volume overload and potential infections.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. There"

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
- She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The respiratory failure is likely caused by volume overload and worsening mental status.
- The patient has hypotension and is on vasopressor support for maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
- She has thrombocytopenia with decreased platelet count and fibrinogen levels, along with elevated fibrin degradation products, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient has mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, but other causes such as medication effects or active infection are also considered.
- She has acute renal failure, possibly acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), with anuria and a urine sodium level of 29.
- The patient has anemia, with no history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and is menstruating minimally.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of ETOH hepatitis and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 107/58 mmHg to 132/83 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is edematous in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 23.1 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, increased creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include altered mental status (not delirium), bradycardia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hepatorenal syndrome, and a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol use. The plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation, managing blood pressure with levophed as needed, monitoring for signs of infection, improving liver function, and addressing other comorbidities such as anemia, UTI, encephalopathy, and CVVH.

   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. This morning getting 2
   units FFP, 2 units cryoprecipitate due to concern for active bleed with
   significant Hematocrit drop.

   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg

   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   - f/u repeat culture from [**4-28**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure and mental status changes. She has worsening renal failure, DIC, and potential sources of infection including respiratory, C. Difficile, and SBP. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She also has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy with increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of infection, including leukocytosis and positive blood cultures. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is concern for sepsis due to the presence of multiple potential sources of infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure. She is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has anuria and worsening renal function, suggesting acute renal failure. She is on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) with a target fluid removal of 100-200 cc/hr.
4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has low platelets, increased fibrinolysis, and decreased fibrinogen, consistent with DIC. She is receiving FFP and cryoprecipitate"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU since April 23rd and has a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcoholic causes. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and organ functions.

24-hour events include blood cultures taken from the HD cath and PICC line, as well as urine culture. The patient's sedation was discontinued, and they became more alert but did not follow commands. Fibrinogen levels were below 100, and high FDP levels were noted without schistocytes, suggesting either disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or severe liver disease. The patient received 1 unit of cryoprecipitate and 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hematocrit (HCT) level below 24. Overnight, the HCT dropped to 14, and the patient's heart rate increased to the 110s. There was no obvious source of bleeding, so the patient is receiving 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2 units of cryoprecipitate, and 0.3 mcg/kg of desmopressin (DDAVP). Hemolysis labs are being checked, and a CT abdomen/pelvis has been ordered.

The patient's WBC count has increased to 33, and stool C. Diff testing has been sent. Bedside abdominal ultrasound (U/S) was performed without accessible ascites to tap. The patient was started on vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl. The ET tube was advanced, and allergies include Demerol (Oral).

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were ceftriaxone on April 26th at 9:00 PM and vancomycin on April 26th at 10:00 PM. The patient is currently on norepinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/min and propofol at 15 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) given at 8:38 PM on April 28th.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/57 to 132/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been intubated, jaundiced, opens eyes spontaneously but does not follow commands, and has significant scleral icterus. The patient's neck is supple with no jugular venous distention (JVD), lungs are clear bilaterally, and the heart has a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 + S2 sounds. The abdomen is soft and distended, and there is 3"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with worsening difficulty weaning
   off levophed, leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.  Potential
   sources of infection include respiratory although stable on ventilator,
   C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   -blood cultures
   -urine culture
   - trend lactate
   - Abdominal U/S to eval for tappable pocket - consider paracentesis to
   evaluate for SBP
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl day 1
   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
   low platelets with increased thrombin generation
   (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated FDP).
   Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. This morning getting 2
   units FFP, 2 units cryoprecipitate due to concern for active bleed with
   significant Hematocrit drop.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100K
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  No obvious source of bleeding clinically.  Currently getting
   2  units for HCT of 14
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -Ct abdomen / pelvis if stable
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, mental status changes, worsening renal failure, and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and respiratory failure. She has a significant positive fluid balance, suggesting volume overload.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelets, elevated fibrin degradation products (FDP), and a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating coagulopathy. The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by anuria and elevated creatinine levels.

The patient's blood cultures have grown yeast, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). She has also been found to have abdominal fluid with brown sediment, which may indicate spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl. She has also received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2 units of cryoprecipitate, and 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

The patient's condition continues to deteriorate, with worsening mental status, hypotension, and multiorgan dysfunction. The patient's prognosis is poor, and the healthcare team is considering a family meeting to discuss goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and liver failure. The patient is sedated and encephalopathic, unable to provide any history. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 115/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been on multiple pressors including norepinephrine, and her blood cultures have been drawn. She has received blood transfusions and cryoprecipitate to address anemia and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's liver failure may progress to hepatorenal syndrome, leading to acute kidney injury.
2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to her compromised immune system, prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, and indwelling lines/catheters.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathic state could worsen, leading to increased confusion, altered mental status, and potential development of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a bleeding risk, especially considering her history of cirrhosis and recent transfusions.
5. Septic Shock: Given the patient's hypotension and elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, currently experiencing hypotension likely due to septic shock, hepatic failure, liver failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a drop in hematocrit. She is sedated and encephalopathic, unable to provide her own medical history. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure and is also experiencing altered mental status, bradycardia, and hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. If not properly managed, there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress, lung infections, or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated. Close monitoring and aggressive management of blood pressure, fluid balance, and infection control are essential.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathic state may be a result of hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver failure. It is crucial to manage the patient's ammonia levels and electrolyte imbalances to prevent further deterioration of mental status.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's low platelet count and elevated D-dimer suggest DIC, a serious condition that can"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint includes respiratory failure, liver failure, and hypotension. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and is currently experiencing altered mental status, bradycardia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hepatorenal syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/63 to 132/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation. The patient is also showing signs of fluid overload, with an edema in both lower extremities.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, high liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The blood cultures have been sent for analysis.

The patient's condition is described as critically ill, with multiple organ dysfunctions. The medical team has initiated appropriate treatments, including antibiotics, blood product transfusion, and hemodialysis. However, the prognosis appears to be poor, and discussions regarding end-of-life decisions are ongoing with the patient's family.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of liver and kidney function, development of septic shock, and progression of DIC. Close monitoring and management of these complications will be necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening, and a large left rectus sheath hematoma. The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate. The patient's family has been informed about their diagnosis and prognosis during a family meeting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe sepsis or septic shock due to C. diff infection.
2. Coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as indicated by elevated PT/PTT/INR levels.
3. Hypotension and shock due to fluid losses and blood product transfusions.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to the severity of the infection and organ damage.
6. Hemodynamic instability and cardiac dysfunction due to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy or pre-existing heart conditions.
7. Abdominal compartment syndrome due to the large rectus sheath hematoma and abdominal distension.
8. Malnutrition and poor nutritional status due to prolonged ICU stay and inability to eat.
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism ("

   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions over
   last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units
   FFP.

   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis

   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, mental status changes, worsening renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, liver failure, acute renal failure, and possible urinary tract infection. She requires critical care in the ICU with multiple interventions and ongoing monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She has a positive fluid balance and volume overload, which may contribute to her respiratory distress. Weaning off the ventilator should be done carefully with close monitoring of ABGs.

2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and decreased fibrinogen, suggestive of DIC. She has received transfusions of pRBCs, cryoprecipitate, platelets, and FFP to manage her coagulopathy. It is important to maintain a platelet count above 50K and fibrinogen above 100 mg/dL.

3. Anemia: The patient has a significant drop in hematocrit from 24% to 14%, which could be due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC. Serial HCT, transfusion for HCT <24, and evaluation for schistocytes are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, hepatic failure, liver failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 134/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 36.7°C.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is not attentive and does not follow simple commands, indicating a cognitive impairment.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is below the normal range, which could be due to medication or an underlying condition.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a new left lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray, indicating a possible infection.

4. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has renal failure in the setting of liver failure, which is known as hepatorenal syndrome.

5. Rectus sheath hematoma: The patient has a large hematoma in the rectus sheath, causing a drop in hemoglobin concentration. This could be due to bleeding within the abdomen or another site.

6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC,"

 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions from
   [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 3 units cryo, 4 units platelets, 7 units
   FFP.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on imaging.
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - blood smear for schistocytes (negative)
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty weaning off
   levophed (not currently on), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.
   Potential sources of infection include respiratory although stable on
   ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout the mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8).
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - PSV as tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]; however
   repeat culture [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She has thrombocytopenia/DIC, anemia, hypotension/possible infection, respiratory failure, liver failure, acute renal failure, and mental status changes. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient's current condition is complicated by several medical complications, including potential infections such as C. diff, SBP, pneumonia, and UTI, as well as DIC, volume overload, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of acute liver failure.
2. Infections: The patient is at risk for various infections, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). These infections can worsen her condition and lead to sepsis.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has low platelets, increased thrombin generation, and elevated FDP levels, suggesting a possible diagnosis of DIC. This condition can lead to bleeding and clotting complications.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has thrombocytopenia/DIC, anemia, hypotension/possible infection, respiratory failure, liver failure secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis, acute renal failure likely ATN or HRS, and mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, levophed, propofol, vitamin K, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10, a blood pressure of 90/47 mmHg, a heart rate of 74 bpm, a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 41, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST 76/126), hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's chest X-ray shows increased heart size, mediastinal caliber, and pulmonary vascular plethora, suggesting the possibility of concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient's abdominal ultrasound reveals diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening concerning for infectious source (C. diff), large left rectus sheath fluid collection appearing to be blood, small bilateral pleural effusions, and diffuse fat stranding throughout the mesentery. The patient has a MELD score of 45 and a discriminant function of 137. The patient's condition is unstable, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment for her multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 BRADYCARDIA
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with worsening difficulty weaning
   off levophed, leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.  Potential
   sources of infection include respiratory although stable on ventilator,
   C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   -blood cultures
   -urine culture
   - trend lactate
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast today
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl day 1
   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP if PICC is a power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions over
   last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units
   FFP.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  Total transfusions over last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units
   cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units FFP. Patient with rectus sheath bleed
   on imaging.
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, presenting with acute liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, renal failure, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. He has received multiple blood transfusions over the past two days. Laboratory findings indicate elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. Imaging studies show diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening concerning for infectious source (C. diff), large left rectus sheath fluid collection appearing to be blood, small bilateral pleural effusions, and diffuse fat stranding throughout the mesentery. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, pantoprazole, and propofol. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension requiring levophed support. Potential medical complications include sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, DIC, thrombocytopenia, anemia, liver failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's prognosis is poor given the trend in liver function tests and coagulation parameters."

   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP if PICC is a power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions over
   last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units
   FFP.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  Total transfusions over last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units
   cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units FFP. Patient with rectus sheath bleed
   on imaging.
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible DIC. The patient has been diagnosed with acute alcoholic hepatitis and is experiencing multi-organ dysfunction, including liver failure, renal failure, and respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Infection: The patient has signs of possible infections such as pneumonia, C. diff colitis, and urinary tract infection. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen as necessary is crucial.

2. Bleeding: The patient has a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, which may indicate active bleeding. Given the history of cirrhosis and potential esophageal or gastric varices, there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding and transfusing as needed is important.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment with lactulose and rifaximin should be continued to manage this condition.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis. CVVH has been initiated, and renal consult recommendations should be appreciated. Monitoring renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, currently in the ICU for septic shock, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, liver failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a large rectus sheath hematoma and is experiencing altered mental status, bradycardia, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. Her blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSI) of 33. She is receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, propofol, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, pantoprazole, and others as per the ICU team's note.

The patient has been diagnosed with hepato-renal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and cirrhosis. She is also experiencing complications such as a large rectus sheath hematoma, respiratory failure, DIC, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her lung function does not improve.

   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**])
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .

   [**2147-5-1**] RUE ultrasound: No evidence for right upper extremity DVT.
   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**])
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, hypotension/possible infection, liver failure, acute renal failure, and mental status changes. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a complication of liver failure characterized by mental status changes, confusion, and altered levels of consciousness.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and worsening mental status may lead to respiratory failure, which is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation.
3. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelet count and evidence of increased thrombin generation, fibrinolysis, and coagulopathy. This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Anemia: The significant drop in hematocrit suggests active bleeding or hemolysis/DIC. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient has difficulty weaning off vasopressor support and shows signs of leukocytosis, indicating a potential infection. Sources of infection include respiratory, Clostr"

   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
   [**2147-5-2**] CXR: Report pending (ETT appears very close to carina,
   worsening left lower opacity)
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**])
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma. She also has leukocytosis, anemia, hypotension, and possible infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The goal is to wean off the ventilator in the near future.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and increased fibrinolysis. This indicates a possible diagnosis of DIC, although it is difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy associated with severe liver disease on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
3. Anemia: The patient has experienced a significant drop in hematocrit from 24% to 14% in the setting of coagulopathy on prednisone, which is concerning for active bleeding versus hemolysis/DIC. No history of gastrointestinal bleeding"

   IMAGES:
   [**2147-5-1**] RUE ultrasound: No evidence for right upper extremity DVT.
   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
   [**2147-5-2**] CXR: Report pending (ETT appears very close to carina,
   worsening left lower opacity)
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient's condition is complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rectus sheath bleed, and possible infections such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and sepsis. She also has leukocytosis, anemia, and acute renal failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The goal is to wean PEEP and eventually extubate the patient in the near future.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and elevated fibrinolysis. There is a concern for DIC, although it may be difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy associated with severe liver disease on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
3. Anemia: There has been a significant drop in hematocrit from 24 to 14, which may be due to active bleeding or hemolysis/DIC. The patient has a history of GI bleeding, but this is unknown for the current case. A rectus sheath bleed has been identified on imaging.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient is afebrile but has difficulty weaning off levophed, leukocytosis, and DIC, which raises concern for sepsis. Potential sources of infection include respiratory, C. diff, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
5. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's MELD score is 45, indicating severe liver disease.
6. Acute Renal Failure: Likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN), less likely hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
7. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though medication effect from ativan or active infection could also be contributing factors. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given the patient's history of alcoholism, acute liver failure, and encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, difficulty weaning off levophed, and DIC raise concern for sepsis. Potential sources of infection include respiratory, C. diff, and SBP.
3. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and there is a concern for ongoing bleeding, as indicated by the significant drop in hematocrit and the identification of a rectus sheath bleed on imaging.
4. Hepatoxicity: The patient may be at risk for hepatotoxicity from medications such as fluconazole and propofol."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. There are multiple medical complications that can arise in this case, including respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, hypotension/possible infection, liver failure, acute renal failure, and mental status changes. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The goal of extubation in the near future has been planned given the patient's improvement in following commands.

2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and increased fibrinolysis. This is likely due to DIC, which is a secondary complication of severe liver disease. The patient has received multiple transfusions, and the platelet count has been stable at >50K, fibrinogen trending down but >100, and INR now 2.2. Monitoring platelet count, fibrinogen levels, and DIC labs will be important in managing this condition.

3. Anemia: The patient has experienced a significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of coagul"

   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose

   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, mental status changes, worsening renal failure, and respiratory failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, hypotension/possible infection, liver failure secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis, acute renal failure (likely ATN or HRS), and mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the patient does not improve or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or tracheal injury.

2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets, increased thrombin generation, and increased fibrinolysis, which indicates DIC. This condition can lead to bleeding complications and requires close monitoring and management.

3. Anemia: The patient has a significant drop in hematocrit, which may be due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC. This can result in symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning off vasopressor support, leuk"

   cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar parenchymal
   opacities and mild retrocardiac opacify are unchanged. Low lung volumes
   are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural
   effusions.
   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course (will confirm with
   liver team)
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient's course has been complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), cryoprecipitate, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia/DIC, anemia, hypotension/possible infection, liver failure, acute renal failure, and mental status changes. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being weaned off the ventilator, and plans include daily wake-ups, weaning PEEP as tolerated, and attempting spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) after the new hemodialysis (HD) line placement. Extubation may be attempted in the near future.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and increased fibrinolysis. DIC likely exists, but it is difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy associated with severe liver disease on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's platelet count is stable at >50K, and fibrinogen is trending down but still >100. INR is now 2.2. Total transfusions since 4/29: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units platelets, and 9 units FFP.
3. Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line removed.

   CXR [**2147-5-2**]: The endotracheal tube now terminates 2 cm above the
   carina. A feeding tube terminates in the proximal stomach. The
   cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar parenchymal
   opacities and mild retrocardiac opacify are unchanged. Low lung volumes
   are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural
   effusions.
   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course (will confirm with
   liver team)
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has experienced multiple complications including thrombocytopenia/DIC, anemia, hypotension/possible infection, liver failure, acute renal failure, and mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. There is a risk of weaning off the ventilator, and extubation may be considered in the near future.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and increased fibrinolysis. There is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead to bleeding complications.
3. Anemia: The patient has a significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14. This could be due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient has difficulty weaning off levophed, leukocytosis, and DIC, which raises concerns for sepsis. Potential sources of infection include respiratory,"

   CXR [**2147-5-2**]: The endotracheal tube now terminates 2 cm above the
   carina. A feeding tube terminates in the proximal stomach. The
   cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar parenchymal
   opacities and mild retrocardiac opacify are unchanged. Low lung volumes
   are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural
   effusions.
   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - check sputum culture
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum culture to
   guide antibiotics)
   - d/c PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2 and d/c c.diff
   precautions
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP but D/C PO vanc and IV flagyl for
   empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal support.

The patient has experienced multiple complications, including thrombocytopenia/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, hypotension/possible infection, and mental status changes. She also has evidence of volume overload, as indicated by the worsening respiratory status and fluid balance.

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, elevated INR, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening concerning for infectious source, large left rectus sheath fluid collection, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ dysfunctions. The treatment plan includes antibiotics for possible sepsis, transfusion for anemia, management of DIC, and supportive care for liver failure, renal failure, and mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to volume overload and the"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C (99.9 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/57 mmHg to 144/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV, tidal volume (Vt) of 526 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 58. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.8-18.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 26.6-28.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 52-68 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) of 1.5-2.6 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 26-29 mmHg, glucose level of 110-169 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.3 mmol/L. The coagulation profile reveals a prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/international normalized ratio (INR) of 20.6/38.8/1.9, and fibrinogen level of 129 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Radiology images show an endotracheal tube terminating 2 cm above the carina, a feeding tube in the proximal stomach, unchanged cardiomediastinal contours, bibasilar parenchymal opacities, mild retrocardiac opacify, and no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusions. 

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. The patient is currently on various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and supportive care. The patient's family has allergies to Demerol (Meperidine Hcl). 

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include but are not limited to:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of multiple lines, tubes, and the fact that he is immunocompromised.
2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged PT/PTT/INR, suggesting a bleeding tendency. Additionally, there was an episode of marked bleeding from the right groin site, which required intervention.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, potentially leading to further respiratory distress.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, which is a complication of liver disease and can lead to acute kidney injury.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
6. Cardiac issues: The patient's bradycardia and fluctuating blood pressure readings indicate a need for cardiac monitoring and potential intervention.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical condition to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   CXR [**2147-5-2**]: The endotracheal tube now terminates 2 cm above the
   carina. A feeding tube terminates in the proximal stomach. The
   cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar parenchymal
   opacities and mild retrocardiac opacify are unchanged. Low lung volumes
   are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural
   effusions.
   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course (will confirm with
   liver team)
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute liver failure and subsequently developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She was intubated and started on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient's course has been complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), cryoprecipitate, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. Weaning of PEEP is planned, and the goal is extubation in the near future after placement of a new hemodialysis (HD) line.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis. There is a concern for DIC, but it is difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been stable at >50K, fibrinogen is trending down but still >100, and INR is now 2.2. Total transfusions since 04/29: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units platelets"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of ETOH hepatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. She experienced bleeding from a line site after its removal yesterday. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to respiratory failure. Her vital signs show hypotension (BP: 117/55 mmHg) and bradycardia (HR: 80 bpm). The patient has edema in both lower extremities and jaundice. Her laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 73/101), hyponatremia (Na+: 26 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (Glucose: 169), and thrombocytopenia (Plt: 57). The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirium. She is also diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening hypoxemia may occur if proper infection control measures and ventilation strategies are not implemented.
2. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, and there is a potential risk of further deterioration in kidney function. Complications like volume overload or electrolyte imbalances can arise if fluid balance and electrolyte management are not carefully monitored.
3. Hemorrhage: Although no further evidence of"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   - Goal net neg 2L today via CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 [**5-4**] level 1.3 (stable)
   - sputum culture
 unclear quality of specimen; no commensals; sparse
   yeast
 consider getting [**Last Name (un) 206**]/spec and restarting antifungals
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics). Will redose vanc today.
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)

   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis if more ascites appreciable
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)

   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new
   temp HD line placed [**5-3**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team

   #. Mental Status Changes: Improving; when Propofol is lightened,
   patient is able to follow commands, nod head to Qs.. Likely due to
   hepatic encephalopathy, though differential also includes medication
   effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is
   likely given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure and now
   encephalopathy. Initial discriminant function 137.  Per liver team,
   prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these
   values appear ~stable or improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - propofol only as needed for comfort
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above

   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload. The patient has a significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14, and there is concern for active bleeding or hemolysis/DIC. She has thrombocytopenia with increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis, suggesting DIC. The patient also has leukocytosis and a positive yeast culture from the urine, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. She is being treated for possible sepsis, including broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's mental status is improving, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, and she is following commands when Propofol is lightened. Her prognosis is poor given the trend in her liver function tests and coagulation profile. She is being treated for liver failure, DIC, and possible infections. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload. Weaning off the ventilator will be attempted, but the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis, suggesting DIC. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   - Goal neg 100cc/h today via CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.

   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics). Will redose vanc today.
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)

   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis if more ascites appreciable
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, presenting with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient's condition is complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rectus sheath bleed, thrombocytopenia, anemia, possible infection, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to volume overload.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and elevated fibrin degradation products. This indicates a possible coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding complications.
3. Anemia: The patient has experienced a significant drop in hematocrit levels, which can be concerning for active bleeding or hemolysis/DIC. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient is leukocytosis and has difficulty weaning off vasopressors. There is a concern for sepsis, possibly due to respiratory, C. difficile-associated disease, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
5. Liver failure: The patient has secondary acute liver failure, likely due to acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 [**5-4**] level 1.3 (stable)
   - sputum culture
 unclear quality of specimen; no commensals; sparse
   yeast
 consider getting [**Last Name (un) 206**]/spec and restarting antifungals
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new
   temp HD line placed [**5-3**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Improving; when Propofol is lightened,
   patient is able to follow commands, nod head to Qs.. Likely due to
   hepatic encephalopathy, though differential also includes medication
   effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is
   likely given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure and now
   encephalopathy. Initial discriminant function 137.  Per liver team,
   prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these
   values appear ~stable or improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - propofol only as needed for comfort
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC increased; C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ?urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP as above but D/C PO vanc and IV
   flagyl for empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and a rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's anemia is significant, with a hematocrit drop from 24 to 14, in the setting of coagulopathy on prednisone, concerning for active bleeding versus hemolysis/DIC. There is no history of gastrointestinal bleeding, but the patient had bleeding from the groin site on day 2 post HD line removal.

The patient has leukocytosis and potential sources of infection include respiratory, C. difficile-associated disease, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's sputum culture is unclear, with no commensals and sparse yeast growth. Blood cultures have been obtained, and the patient is being treated empirically for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's liver failure is secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis, with elevated liver enzymes and a"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - check sputum culture
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum culture to
   guide antibiotics)
   - d/c PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2 and d/c c.diff
   precautions
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP but D/C PO vanc and IV flagyl for
   empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient's course has been complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), cryoprecipitate, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia/DIC, anemia, hypotension/possible infection, liver failure, acute renal failure, and mental status changes. She has undergone several interventions, including CVVH, placement of a dialysis catheter, and the administration of various medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ongoing respiratory failure, further deterioration in renal function, progression of liver failure, development of sepsis, and potential bleeding complications due to DIC. The patient's prognosis is poor given the trend in her liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation parameters.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: Continue weaning PEEP, daily wake-ups, and monitor ABGs. Consider extubation after HD line placement.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: Maintain platelet count > 50"

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 [**5-4**] level 1.3 (stable)
   - sputum culture
 unclear quality of specimen; no commensals; sparse
   yeast
 consider getting [**Last Name (un) 206**]/spec and restarting antifungals
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new
   temp HD line placed [**5-3**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Improving; when Propofol is lightened,
   patient is able to follow commands, nod head to Qs.. Likely due to
   hepatic encephalopathy, though differential also includes medication
   effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is
   likely given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure and now
   encephalopathy. Initial discriminant function 137.  Per liver team,
   prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these
   values appear ~stable or improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - propofol only as needed for comfort
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC increased; C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ?urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP as above but D/C PO vanc and IV
   flagyl for empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and worsening renal failure, mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rectus sheath bleed, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure and is on a 28-day course of prednisone. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including respiratory, renal, and hepatic failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by altered mental status due to liver dysfunction and the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream.

2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): This is a serious disorder characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body, leading to both bleeding and clotting problems.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): This condition is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation and respiratory failure.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, which may progress to acute kidney injury if not managed appropriately.

5. Infections: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, she is at high risk for infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.

6. Bleeding: The patient has experienced"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of ETOH hepatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. She is currently stable in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/81 to 138/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, tidal volume (Vt) of 409 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 75. 

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, right and left lower extremity edema, warm skin, and attentive mental status. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 52 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27.9 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, glucose level of 109 mg/dL, and liver function tests within normal range. 

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. 

The assessment and plan include altered mental status, bradycardia, respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), hepatorenal syndrome, and a history of cirrhosis. The patient's respiratory failure will be evaluated through a repeat spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Fluid overload and renal failure will continue to be managed with fluid removal while maintaining stable blood pressure. ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis are stable with no significant changes. Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam will be continued for a total of 8 days for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition via Nutren 2.0 at 25 mL/hour, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU."
