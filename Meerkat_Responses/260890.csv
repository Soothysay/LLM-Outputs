   Assessment and Plan
   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD presents with progressive DOE in
   setting of large right sided infiltrate continuing to evolve on CXR.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure
   Pt with large right sided infiltrate with progression of opacities to
   include left lung as well on progressive CXRs despite tx with
   ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Ddx includes resistant/not-covered
   organism (MRSA, pseudomonas, nocardia, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 72**]; viral less likely)
   v. slow-responding PNA. No clinical history to suggest a new aspiration
   event. Pt with no unusual exposures but may have some immunosuppression
   [**2-15**] likely multiple myeloma, diabetes. Given the Hct drop would also
   consider pulmonary hemorrhage, especially given finding of ARF with RBC
   casts in U/A today. Other non-infectious possibilities for respiratory
   decompensation including interstitial lung disease acceleration, PE,
   mucous plugging, pulmonary edema (?in setting of blood transfusion
   although time course may be off). Plasmacytoma unlikely. CXR without
   evidence for worsening effusions or pneumothorax.
   - Cont cefepime and vancomycin for expanded coverage and azithro for
   atypical coverage pending further data. Although pt may not be
   immunosuppressed enough to place her at risk for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **], would
   empirically start tx w/ bactrim and steroids
   - Chest CT to further characterize R infiltrate. Pt has known R sided
   pulmonary nodule which was increased in size last chest CT [**2112**]8.
   - Obtain sputum for gram stain and culture
 may need induced specimen,
   repeat blood cultures if febrile
   - Immunoglobulin levels within normal limits therefore IVIG probably
   not helpful.
   - Wean facemask as tolerated
   2. Anemia
   Hct drop overnight might be due to fluid resuscitation. Pt does have
   history of gastritis on [**7-19**] EGD so GIB (or pulmonary, as above)
   possible.  Also concern for pulm hemorrhage as above. However, Hct has
   stayed stable after transfusion. Progressive anemia since the fall may
   be due to progression to multiple myeloma or [**2-15**] renal insufficiency.
   Hemolysis unlikely given nl Tbili. B12 and folate WNL [**10-20**].
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active type and screen, maintain PIV x 2, follow Hct q8, transfuse
   Hb<8
   3. MGUS with ?progression to myeloma
   Heme evaluation had been planned as an outpatient.
   - Followup SPEP and UPEP and consider skeletal survey pending PEPs
   - Consult heme today
   4. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Cr has doubled since [**10-20**]. FENa not specific for pre-renal or
   intrinsic renal etiology. U/A concerning for glomerulonephritis given
   RBC and protein. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to myeloma (light chain dz, amyloid, etc).
   Glomerulonephritis also concerning for vasculitides such as Wegener
   and Goodpasture
s given presence of pulm hemorrhage on differential of
   resp [**Month (only) **]. HTN and DM appear to be well controlled so progressive
   renal disease due to these seems less likely.
   - Renal and Heme consults; may need biopsy
   - F/u SPEP/UPEP; renal U/S; check ANCAs, anti-GBM, hepatitis panel
   - Hold [**Last Name (un) **], renally dose meds prn
   - Follow urine output
   5. DM
   - Following fingersticks QACHS, insulin sliding scale goal <150
   6. CAD
   - Continue ASA, statin
   - Change atenolol to metoprolol given renal insufficiency
   7. HTN
   Currently well controlled.
   - Cont home CCB. Atenolol changed to metoprolol.
   - Holding [**Last Name (un) **] as above
   8. Hypothyroid
   Continuing home dose levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), multiple myeloma (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was found to have a large right-sided infiltrate. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia superimposed on ILD. Other possible causes of respiratory decompensation include interstitial lung disease acceleration, pulmonary embolism, mucous plugging, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened despite antimicrobial therapy, suggesting the possibility of evolving consolidation/atelectasis or multilobar pneumonia, possibly due to resistant bacteria such as MRSA or gram-negative bacteria.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped overnight, which could be due to fluid resuscitation or gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from a history of gastritis. Progressive anemia since the fall may be due to progression of underlying plasma cell disorder or renal insufficiency.
3. MGUS with possible progression to myeloma: The patient has a history of MGUS, and further evaluation is needed to assess for progression to myeloma.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has doubled since the last check, indicating worsening renal function. Further evaluation is needed to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD presents with progressive DOE and
   is found to have a large right sided infiltrate.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure
   Most likely secondary to pneumonia superimposed on interstitial lung
   disease. Progression on CXR despite antimicrobial therapy may represent
   evolving consolidation/atelectasis in setting of multilobar PNA
   (especially pneumococcal given possible myeloma) v. resistant bacteria
   (MRSA, resistant gram negative, pseudomonas) v. viral. No clinical
   history to suggest a new aspiration event. Other non-infectious
   possibilities for respiratory decompensation including interstitial
   lung disease acceleration, PE, mucous plugging, pulmonary edema, which
   are less compelling. CXR without evidence for worsening effusions or
   pneumothorax. Given the Hct drop would also consider pulmonary
   hemorrhage.
   - Cont cefepime and vancomycin for expanded coverage and azithro for
   atypical coverage pending further data.
   - Check urine legionalla antigen, attempt to obtain sputum for gram
   stain and culture, repeat blood cultures if febrile
   - Immunoglobulin levels within normal limits therefore IVIG probably
   not helpful.
   - Wean facemask as tolerated
   - Consider chest CT to further characterize R infiltrate. Pt has known
   R sided pulmonary nodule which was increased in size last chest CT fall
   08.
   2. Anemia
   Hct drop overnight might be due to fluid resuscitation. Pt does have
   history of gastritis on [**7-19**] EGD so GIB (or pulmonary, as above)
   possible. Think hemolysis is less likely. Progressive anemia since the
   fall may be due to progression of underlying plasma cell disorder,
   renal insufficiency. B12 and folate WNL [**10-20**].

","Summary:
- The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD).
- She presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and has been found to have a large right-sided infiltrate.
- The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia superimposed on ILD.
- There is a consideration for other non-infectious possibilities for respiratory decompensation, including interstitial lung disease acceleration, pulmonary embolism (PE), mucous plugging, pulmonary edema, which are less compelling.
- The patient's Hct dropped overnight, which could be due to fluid resuscitation. Other potential causes include gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) or pulmonary hemorrhage.
- The patient has a history of gastritis and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) from 7/19, so GIB is a possibility.
- Progressive anemia since the fall may be due to progression of the underlying plasma cell disorder, renal insufficiency, or hemolysis.
- The patient has MGUS with possible progression to myeloma.
- Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), acute on chronic renal failure, hypertension (HTN), and hypothyroidism.
- The patient is currently receiving treatment for respiratory failure, anemia, MGUS, diabetes"

   79 yo female with baseline impairment in DLCO in the setting of current
   working diagnosis of NSIP who has progression of dyspnea and now with
   evolution of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in right lung with areas of
   consolidation.  She has had progression during admission of hypoxemia.
   This may represent an evolution of further areas of consolidation and
   or atelectasis in the setting of multi-lobar PNA.  Alternatively this
   may represent progression of resistant bacteria or alternatively viral
   PNA (ie. VZV) progressing in the setting of severe multilobar insult.
   Alternatively we must consider possible insult such as accelerated
   process of interstitial lung disease or AIP must be considered.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage can be seen in this setting but again would not
   explain complete picture.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes, MGUS, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presented with progressive dyspnea and was found to have a large right-sided infiltrate. She has been admitted to the ICU and has shown worsening hypoxemia despite antimicrobial therapy. The progression on chest X-ray may represent evolving consolidation/atelectasis in the setting of multi-lobar pneumonia or resistant bacterial infection. Other possible causes for respiratory decompensation include interstitial lung disease acceleration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely secondary to pneumonia superimposed on interstitial lung disease. Progression on CXR despite antimicrobial therapy may represent evolving consolidation/atelectasis in the setting of multilobar PNA (especially pneumococcal given possible myeloma) v. resistant bacteria (MRSA, resistant gram-negative, pseudomonas) v. viral.

   79 yo female with baseline impairment in DLCO in the setting of current
   working diagnosis of NSIP who has progression of dyspnea and now with
   evolution of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in right lung with areas of
   consolidation.  She has had progression during admission of hypoxemia.
   This may represent an evolution of further areas of consolidation and
   or atelectasis in the setting of multi-lobar PNA.  Alternatively this
   may represent progression of resistant bacteria or alternatively viral
   PNA (ie. VZV) progressing in the setting of severe multilobar insult.
   Alternatively we must consider possible insult such as accelerated
   process of interstitial lung disease or AIP must be considered.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage can be seen in this setting but again would not
   explain complete picture.
   1)Acute resp failure
   -Continue with NRB mask and consider high flow oxygen
   -Will need to continue with deep breath/cough/ OOB to maintain aeration
   -Discussed with patient possibility and indeed risk for progression to
   intubation which she would want
   -No evidence of PE or obvious CHF but objectively seems to be improving
   post 1 L negative overnight.
   2)Pneumonia-
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Azithro
   - Will have to consider BAL if intubated but not stable for now
   - Sputum GS C+S if obtained
   - not covering PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7462**] or fungal infection at this time.
   - will consider pulm-renal syndrome, check ANCA and anti-GBM
   - non contrast CT chest today if can lay flat
   3) Acute Renal Failure-
   -neprhotic range proteinuria and rbc casts
   -Urine Lytes
   -renal ultrasound
   -SPEP/UPEP pending. [**Month (only) 51**] need BM bx

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, MGUS, and IPF. She was admitted with fatigue and malaise and diagnosed with pneumonia in her right lung. She required nasal cannula oxygen to maintain saturation levels. Her condition worsened, leading to transfer to the ICU for progressive respiratory distress and increased oxygen requirements. She has been receiving various antibiotics, including cefepime and azithromycin, but her symptoms have not improved. She is now on non-rebreather mask with high-flow oxygen. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Her lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, renal failure with nephrotic-range proteinuria, and impaired lung function. Imaging shows diffuse right-sided infiltrates and increased left lower lobe consolidation. The patient is diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypoxemia, and possible multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and inadequate oxygenation may progress to acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest bacterial pneumonia. If her condition does not improve with current antibiotic therapy, alternative treatments or broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis may be considered"

   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD presents with progressive DOE in
   setting of large right sided infiltrate continuing to evolve on CXR.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure
   Pt with large right sided infiltrate with progression of opacities to
   include left lung as well on progressive CXRs despite tx with
   ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Ddx includes resistant/not-covered
   organism (MRSA, pseudomonas, nocardia, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 72**]; viral less likely)
   v. slow-responding PNA. No clinical history to suggest a new aspiration
   event. Pt with no unusual exposures but may have some immunosuppression
   [**2-15**] likely multiple myeloma, diabetes. Given the Hct drop would also
   consider pulmonary hemorrhage, especially given finding of ARF with RBC
   casts in U/A today. Other non-infectious possibilities for respiratory
   decompensation including interstitial lung disease acceleration, PE,
   mucous plugging, pulmonary edema (?in setting of blood transfusion
   although time course may be off). Plasmacytoma unlikely. CXR without
   evidence for worsening effusions or pneumothorax.
   - Cont cefepime and vancomycin for expanded coverage and azithro for
   atypical coverage pending further data. Although pt may not be
   immunosuppressed enough to place her at risk for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **], would
   empirically start tx w/ bactrim and steroids
   - Chest CT to further characterize R infiltrate. Pt has known R sided
   pulmonary nodule which was increased in size last chest CT [**2112**]8.
   - Obtain sputum for gram stain and culture
 may need induced specimen,
   repeat blood cultures if febrile
   - Immunoglobulin levels within normal limits therefore IVIG probably
   not helpful.
   - Wean facemask as tolerated
   2. Anemia
   Hct drop overnight might be due to fluid resuscitation. Pt does have
   history of gastritis on [**7-19**] EGD so GIB (or pulmonary, as above)
   possible.  Also concern for pulm hemorrhage as above. However, Hct has
   stayed stable after transfusion. Progressive anemia since the fall may
   be due to progression to multiple myeloma or [**2-15**] renal insufficiency.
   Hemolysis unlikely given nl Tbili. B12 and folate WNL [**10-20**].
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active type and screen, maintain PIV x 2, follow Hct q8, transfuse
   Hb<8
   3. MGUS with ?progression to myeloma
   Heme evaluation had been planned as an outpatient.
   - Followup SPEP and UPEP and consider skeletal survey pending PEPs
   - Consult heme today
   4. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Cr has doubled since [**10-20**]. FENa not specific for pre-renal or
   intrinsic renal etiology. U/A concerning for glomerulonephritis given
   RBC and protein. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to myeloma (light chain dz, amyloid, etc).
   Glomerulonephritis also concerning for vasculitides such as Wegener
   and Goodpasture
s given presence of pulm hemorrhage on differential of
   resp [**Month (only) **]. HTN and DM appear to be well controlled so progressive
   renal disease due to these seems less likely.
   - Renal and Heme consults; may need biopsy
   - F/u SPEP/UPEP; renal U/S; check ANCAs, anti-GBM, hepatitis panel
   - Hold [**Last Name (un) **], renally dose meds prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was found to have a large right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP). She is also reported to have anemia, other; renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF); multiple myeloma (cancer, malignant neoplasm); hypertension, benign; diabetes mellitus (DM), type II; and hypothyroidism.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Resistant or atypical organism infection: Given the lack of improvement with initial antibiotics, there is a concern for a resistant or atypical organism causing the pneumonia.

2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The presence of anemia and red blood cell casts in the urinalysis raises the possibility of pulmonary hemorrhage, especially in the context of acute renal failure.

3. Progression of multiple myeloma: The drop in hemoglobin concentration may indicate progression of multiple myeloma, which is a known complication.

4. Acute renal failure: The doubling of creatinine levels suggests acute renal failure, which can be due to various causes such as sepsis, dehydration,"

   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD presents with progressive DOE in
   setting of large right sided infiltrate continuing to evolve on CXR.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  R-sided infiltrate and diffuse
   opacities.  Meets criteria for ARDS.  Differential for etiology
   includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic PNA, diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, infectious cause.  Pulmonary-renal vasculitic
   syndrome is also possible.  TRALI unlikely given time course.  She is
   not on immunosuppressive drugs at home but is likely immunosuppressed
   secondary to her diabetes, MGUS, putting her at risk for fungal
   etiology.   Bronch was insufficient for PCP analysis as well as for
   eosinophil count.
   - broncoscopy vs repeat mini-BAL for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] ? eosinophils, will also
   check for blood for DAH
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin for broad coverage as well as
   azithromycin for atypicals
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u beta glucan/galactomannan
   - after broncoscopy, would consider empiric treatment with Bactrim and
   steroids for possible PCP and to cover for nocardia as well.
   - increase PEEP as needed to improve oxygenation and maintain PaO2 >60%
   - MDI PRN
   - f/u labs for possible pulmonary-renal syndrome, including ANCA,
   anti-GBM
   2. Anemia:  Hct bumped appropriately with transfusion 2 days ago.  B12
   and folate have been recently normal.  Cause is likely [**2-15**] ESRD.
   Hematology following and thinks multiple myeloma is less likely.
   Hemolysis labs have been previously normal.  Also there is some concern
   for pulmonary hemmorhage as above.  She does have a history of
   gastritis but GI bleed is unlikely.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] PPI
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse 1 unit today
   3. MGUS:  Appreciate  hematology input.  Multiple myeloma less likely.
   - will likely need bone marrow biopsy in the future but can not
   tolerate positioning currently, will defer until acute issues are
   resolved
   - f/u SPEP and UPEP
   4. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Nephrotic range proteinuria.
   Differential includes myeloma (light chain deposition or amyloid) or
   pulmonary-vascular vasculitis such as Wegener
s/Goodpastures.
   Hepatitis panel was negative.
   - r/u renal recs
   - r/u SPEP/UPEP
   - f/u ANCA, anti-GBM
   - follow urine output
   - vanc trough after 3^rd dose
   5. DM
   - Following fingersticks QACHS, insulin sliding scale goal <150

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, MGUS, and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which has evolved into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis for the etiology of the ARDS includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, infectious cause, and pulmonary-renal vasculitis syndrome.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 16 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 83.

She has a history of multiple myeloma (cancer), hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and activity intolerance. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 20.0% to 23.8%, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 46 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.4 mg/dL, and elevated platelet count (Plt) of 261 K/uL.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS.
2. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP).
3. Anemia, other (likely due to end-stage renal disease).
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF).
5. Multiple myeloma (cancer, malignant neoplasm).
6. Hypertension, benign.
7. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II.
8. Hypothyroidism.
9. Activity intolerance.

These complications will need to be closely monitored and managed accordingly."

 ACTIVITY INTOLERANCE
   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD presents with progressive DOE in
   setting of large right sided infiltrate continuing to evolve on CXR.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  R-sided infiltrate and diffuse
   opacities.  Meets criteria for ARDS.  Differential for etiology
   includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic PNA, diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, infectious cause.  Pulmonary-renal vasculitic
   syndrome is also possible.  TRALI unlikely given time course.  She is
   not on immunosuppressive drugs at home but is likely immunosuppressed
   secondary to her diabetes, MGUS, putting her at risk for fungal
   etiology.   Bronch was insufficient for PCP analysis as well as for
   eosinophil count.
   - broncoscopy vs repeat mini-BAL for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] ? eosinophils, will also
   check for blood for DAH
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin for broad coverage as well as
   azithromycin for atypicals
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u beta glucan/galactomannan
   - after broncoscopy, would consider empiric treatment with Bactrim and
   steroids for possible PCP and to cover for nocardia as well.
   - increase PEEP as needed to improve oxygenation and maintain PaO2 >60%
   - MDI PRN
   - f/u labs for possible pulmonary-renal syndrome, including ANCA,
   anti-GBM
   2. Anemia
   Hct drop overnight might be due to fluid resuscitation. Pt does have
   history of gastritis on [**7-19**] EGD so GIB (or pulmonary, as above)
   possible.  Also concern for pulm hemorrhage as above. However, Hct has
   stayed stable after transfusion. Progressive anemia since the fall may
   be due to progression to multiple myeloma or [**2-15**] renal insufficiency.
   Hemolysis unlikely given nl Tbili. B12 and folate WNL [**10-20**].
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active type and screen, maintain PIV x 2, follow Hct q8, transfuse
   Hb<8
   3. MGUS with ?progression to myeloma
   Heme evaluation had been planned as an outpatient.
   - Followup SPEP and UPEP and consider skeletal survey pending PEPs
   - Consult heme today
   4. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Cr has doubled since [**10-20**]. FENa not specific for pre-renal or
   intrinsic renal etiology. U/A concerning for glomerulonephritis given
   RBC and protein. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to myeloma (light chain dz, amyloid, etc).
   Glomerulonephritis also concerning for vasculitides such as Wegener
   and Goodpasture
s given presence of pulm hemorrhage on differential of
   resp decomp. HTN and DM appear to be well controlled so progressive
   renal disease due to these seems less likely.
   - Renal and Heme consults; may need biopsy
   - F/u SPEP/UPEP; renal U/S; check ANCAs, anti-GBM, hepatitis panel
   - Hold [**Last Name (un) **], renally dose meds prn

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, MGUS, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and a large right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and has been intubated. Her laboratory results indicate anemia, acute renal failure, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's medical history includes multiple myeloma, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia with diffuse opacities on chest imaging, meeting criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other possible etiologies include worsening underlying ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or an infectious cause. Pulmonary-renal vasculitic syndrome is also a possibility.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been dropping, which may be due to fluid resuscitation, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pulmonary hemorrhage, progression to multiple myeloma, or renal insufficiency.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has doubled since the last measurement, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to acute kidney injury or progression of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is also a concern"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, MGUS, and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and was found to have a large right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. She has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis for the etiology includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, infectious cause, and pulmonary-renal vasculitic syndrome.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 80%. Her oxygen saturation is 93%. She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin), azithromycin for atypical coverage, and fentanyl for pain control.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including anemia, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypothyroidism. She also has a history of gastritis, which may be contributing to gastrointestinal bleeding.

The plan includes further evaluation with bronchoscopy versus repeat mini-balloon alveolar lavage for possible Pneumocystis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and was found to have a large right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus. The differential diagnosis for her respiratory failure includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and infectious causes. Pulmonary-renal vasculitis syndrome is also a possibility. She is not on immunosuppressive drugs at home but is likely immunosuppressed secondary to her diabetes and MGUS, putting her at risk for fungal etiology. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal renal function tests. The patient's current medications include cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, and fentanyl. The plan is to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, perform bronchoscopy to rule out PCP and eosinophils, check blood for DAH, increase PEEP as needed to improve oxygenation, and consider empiric treatment with Bactrim and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), interstitial lung disease (ILD), and multiple myeloma (cancer). She presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, acute renal failure, and hypertension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of underlying ILD: The patient's ILD may progress, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Eosinophilic pneumonia: The presence of eosinophils in the BAL fluid suggests the possibility of eosinophilic pneumonia, which can be associated with asthma, allergies, or other underlying conditions.
3. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: Given the patient's anemia and diffuse alveolar damage seen on imaging, there is a risk of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which can worsen respiratory function.
4. Infectious cause: The patient is at risk for infectious complications due to her immunosuppressed state from diabetes and MGUS.
5. Pulmonary-renal vasculitic syndrome: This syndrome should be considered given the patient's renal failure and pulmonary involvement.
6. TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury): Although less likely in this case, TRALI can occur as a complication of blood transfusions.
7. Fungal etiology:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), ILD (interstitial lung disease), DM (diabetes mellitus), and HTN (hypertension). The patient was admitted with worsening dyspnea, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as well as acute renal failure, which may be related to the pulmonary condition. Other assessments include anemia, multiple myeloma (cancer), benign hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, activity intolerance, and MGUS.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia progression: The patient's respiratory symptoms and diffuse bilateral infiltrates suggest bacterial pneumonia. If not properly treated, the infection may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential sepsis.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low p/f ratio indicates the possibility of ARDS, a severe lung condition characterized by impaired gas exchange. ARDS can lead to multi-organ failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Acute renal failure worsening: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring due to the possibility of acute renal failure. If not treated promptly, renal function may deteriorate further, potentially requiring dialysis or renal replacement"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of MGUS, ILD, DM, and multiple comorbidities. The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and progressive respiratory failure. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of hypoxemia, which may require adjustments in the ventilator settings and oxygen supplementation.

2. Bacterial pneumonia: The presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and the patient's immunocompromised state (from MGUS) raise concerns for bacterial pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have already been initiated, but further investigations such as sputum cultures and blood cultures are pending.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria suggest acute renal failure. This may be due to either intrinsic renal injury or prerenal causes such as sepsis or hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential.

4. Multiple myeloma: The patient's history of MGUS raises the suspicion of multiple myeloma. Further evaluation through SPEP/UPEP is pending, and renal biopsy and bone marrow biopsy may be considered when the patient is stable for procedures.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which should be managed appropriately"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of MGUS, ILD, DM, and HTN. She was admitted with worsening dyspnea and lung infiltrates. The patient's condition has progressed, leading to hypoxemia and respiratory distress, requiring intubation. There are concerns for progressive bacterial pneumonia, viral or PCP infection in an immunosuppressed host, or other possible causes such as resistant bacteria, viral pneumonia, or fungal infection. The patient also has acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, activity intolerance, anemia, and possible pulmonary hemorrhage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Acute respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are essential.
2) Pneumonia/lung infiltrates: The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further investigations are needed to identify the causative organism, including bronchoscopy with BAL, LDH levels, sputum Gram stain and culture, and empirical coverage for PCP.
3) Acute renal failure: Pulmonary-renal syndrome should be considered, and ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies should be checked. Renal biopsy and bone marrow biopsy may be necessary for further evaluation.
4) Anemia: The cause of anemia needs to be determined, and appropriate treatment should be initiated based on the underlying cause"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD), who presented with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also has acute renal failure and multiple myeloma.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypothyroidism. The patient meets criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential for the etiology of the respiratory failure includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, infectious cause, and pulmonary-renal vasculitic syndrome.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels. The respiratory culture is pending, and the fungal culture is negative. The immunofluorescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii is negative.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, azithromycin for atypical coverage, and monitoring for eosinophils in the mini-BAL and blood for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The patient is also being evaluated for pulmonary-renal vasculitic syndrome, and rheumatology consultation has been requested.

The patient's nutritional support includes enteral nutrition with Nutren Renal. The glycemic control is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes, MGUS, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and a large right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for the etiology of the infiltrate includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, infectious cause, and pulmonary-renal vasculitis syndrome. The patient is also at risk for fungal etiology due to her immunosuppressed state. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on imaging, and the absence of left atrial pressure elevation. The differential diagnosis for the etiology of the infiltrate includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, infectious cause, and pulmonary-renal vasculitis syndrome. The patient is also at risk for fungal etiology due to her immunosuppressed state.
2. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, which may be due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hematology input suggests that multiple myeloma is less likely, and the cause of anemia is likely related to ESRD"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of MGUS, ILD (with baseline impairment in DLCO), DM, and other comorbidities. She was admitted with worsening dyspnea, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), anemia of unknown origin, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, benign hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, and activity intolerance. The patient's respiratory picture is concerning for an infectious insult on underlying ILD with poor reserve. Bacterial pneumonia, viral infection, PCP, or fungal infection are on the differential diagnosis given some degree of immunosuppression from MGUS. Alternative possibilities include accelerated process of interstitial lung disease or AIP/AEP. DAH or pulmonary/renal syndrome remains a possibility, although without bloody secretions from the ETT, it appears less likely. The patient is currently improving in terms of oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
2. Pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP): The patient has been diagnosed with a bacterial infection in the lungs, which can worsen her respiratory condition and potentially lead to sepsis if not effectively treated.
3. Anemia:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including MGUS, ILD, DM, and a current working diagnosis of NSIP. She was admitted with worsening dyspnea, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient's respiratory picture is concerning for progressive bacterial pneumonia, although viral, PCP, or fungal infection cannot be ruled out due to her immunosuppressed state. Other possible insults such as accelerated interstitial lung disease or autoimmune processes should also be considered.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 149/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 70%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels at 2.4 mg/dL. Other lab values including electrolytes, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus are within normal range.

Imaging studies show diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and"

   Pt  remains tenuous from resp standpoint.  Have made slow progress in
   terms of oxygenation which is promising though is very peep dependent,
   with desats/decrease in pao2 after movement suggesting sig v/q
   mismatch.  Despite overall increase in pao2 have been limited in
   ability to wean fio2 down below 70%.  Esophageal balloon is now in

   standpoint to tolerate bronch.
   To date there is no clear evidence to support infectious etiology with
   mini BAL results neg/ngtd.  Remains empirically covered with broad spec
   antibx.   No evidence of DAH, although unable to conduct serial BAL, or
   AEP by mini BAL cell ct.
   Given respiratory picture with resp failure/diffuse pulm
   infiltrates/ards and no clear infection concern for AIP remains of high
   concern.  Also remaining in ddx is the possibility of a vasculitis or a
   pulm/renal syndrome given ARF and extremely elevated esr/crp and prelim
   p-anca positivity.  Cr does appears to have stabilized and no RBC casts

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old female with MGUS, ILD, and DM.
- She was admitted with worsening dyspnea, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient's respiratory picture suggests an infectious insult on underlying ILD, with potential bacterial, viral, PCP, or fungal infection.
- Other possible diagnoses include accelerated interstitial lung disease (NSIP), acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP), eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), pulmonary-renal syndrome, multiple myeloma transformation, and vasculitis.
- The patient is critically ill, making slow progress in terms of oxygenation but remains peep-dependent.
- There is no clear evidence of infection based on mini BAL results.
- The patient remains empirically covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further investigations are ongoing.
- Given the respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, AIP remains a concern.
- The patient also has acute renal failure, and the possibility of pulmonary-renal syndrome, amyloidosis, or multiple myeloma transformation should be considered.
- Additional tests and treatments are planned, including imaging, rheumatology consultations, and potential initiation of pulse steroids for possible exacerbation of ILD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's respiratory picture suggests an infectious insult on underlying ILD."

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of MGUS, ILD, DM, admitted with worsening dyspnea, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), anemia other, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma (cancer, malignant neoplasm), hypertension benign, and diabetes mellitus type II. 

The patient's current medical issues include hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, acute renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. 

The plan for the patient includes continuing ventilator support with low tidal volumes, weaning FiO2 for PaO2 >60, repeating mini-BAL to evaluate cell counts for eosinophils, and broad coverage with Vancomycin/Cefepime/Azithromycin. 

Other plans include following up with labs, renal, and rheumatology recommendations. The patient is also being evaluated for potential causes of anemia, acute renal failure, MGUS, diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient's nutrition is being managed with Renal (Full) nutrition at a rate of 30 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being monitored and managed as well. 

Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia, community-acquired (CAP), anemia, renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), multiple myeloma, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing severe respiratory distress, which is likely due to ARDS. The initial differential diagnosis includes worsening of underlying ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and infectious causes. Given the presence of p-ANCA and schistocytes, pulmonary-renal vasculitic syndrome is most likely. Further investigations such as mini-BAL, ANCA testing, and rheumatology recommendations should be pursued. Oxygenation has improved, but the patient remains highly dependent on PEEP and high FiO2. Regular monitoring and adjustments to ventilation support are necessary.

2. New fever: The patient's recent fever may be secondary to an inflammatory/vasculitic process. It is essential to rule out ICU-acquired infections, especially considering the declining WBC count. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and imaging of the sinuses and chest"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including MGUS, ILD, DM, HTN, DM, and Hypothyroidism.
- She was admitted with worsening dyspnea, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation and acute renal failure.
- The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), anemia of other causes, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma (cancer), hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, activity intolerance, and possible interstitial lung disease or autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and an esophageal balloon placed for ARDS support.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated empirically, and further diagnostic tests are pending.
- The patient remains critically ill with ongoing issues including acute respiratory failure, diffuse infiltrates, fevers without leukocytosis, acute renal failure, anemia, hypertension, and possible superinfection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's current condition indicates ongoing respiratory distress with diffuse infiltrates and need for mechanical ventilation. ARDS is a potential complication due to the severity of her lung injury.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a"

   Active issues include:
          Acute resp failure

          Htn
          New fever
   This type of diffuse pulm infiltrate is concerning for accelerated
   process of interstitial lung disease or AIP.  Vasculitis or pulm/renal
   syndrome remains of high concern given concurrent arf, though ? of
   amyloid or light chain disease further complicates this picture.
   Additionally would expect to see continued decline in renal function
   rather than stabilization.  Infectious etiologies now seem less
   likely
at onset did not have leukocytosis or fevers
and cx results/mini
   bal finding have all been negative to date. DAH without bloody
   secretions from ETT also appears far less likely.   New fevers this am
   raise concern for new infection though remains without
   secretions/obvious new infiltrate to suggest vap, or diarrhea, and
   lines are all new.  Fevers could be related to inflammatory process or
   vascultits.
   Agree with plan to continue vent support

   balloon to guide peep, weaning o2 to keep pao2 >60. Continue empiric
   broad spec antibx, f/u pending cx data.  Will recx given temp spike
   with low threshold to add double gram neg coverage and fungal
   coverage.  Given ? p-anca and new information about u/a with ? rbc
   casts
will initiate pulse steroids for presumed vasculitis/steroid
   responsive lung process.  Will scan sinuses to assess for involvement
   and r/o sinusitis as possible cause of temp.  Will repeat chest ct to
   assess for change given small improvement in cxr appearance and
   oxygenation.  Renal and rheum input appreciated.  Will pursue renal bx
   in am.  Await  p-anca confirmation.  Maintain active t and c and
   transfuse for hct > 21.  Add norvasc for improved BP control.  Monitor

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of MGUS, ILD, DM, and multiple myeloma. She was admitted with worsening dyspnea, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 16 cmH2O and FiO2 of 70%. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), anemia, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, activity intolerance, and is suspected to have vasculitis or pulmonary/renal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and worsening dyspnea suggest pneumonia. It is important to continue empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and review chest X-ray data.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates indicate ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation and consideration of lung protective strategies are necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest AKI. Renal function should be closely monitored, and further evaluation with renal biopsy may be required.
4. Vasculitis: Given the patient's p-ANCA positivity, new information"

   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD with renal failure and progressive
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Most likely cause is a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome given p-ANCA presumably positive.   High-dose
   steroids started yesterday given this likelihood.  ABG shows excellent
   oxygenation on current vent settings, so perhaps steroids are already
   having some effect.  Her chest CT looks improved from prior. Low
   suspcion for an infectious etiology (PCP and fungal markers have been
   negative); however, she remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.

   - decrease FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated to maintain PaO2 >60
   - f/u final read chest CT
   - continue methylprednisolone 1 g q24h
   - continue vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime until tomorrow (day
   1=[**5-21**]), which will complete a 7-day course in case infectious etiology
   was at play
   - f/u Rheum recs; may discuss starting cytoxan
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  With nephrotic range proteinuria
   and a urinary protein gap.  However, UPEP without any significant
   Bence-[**Doctor Last Name 720**] protein, so myeloma less likely as a cause.  Vasculitis is
   the most likely cause, possibly related to pulmonary issues above.  As
   above, p-ANCA presumptively positive but pending.  Renal biopsy being
   done this morning will aid with diagnosis.  Meanwhile, for treatment,
   steroids started yesterday.
   - continue 1 g methylprednisolone q24h as above
   - follow urine output
   - f/u renal biopsy
   - renal recs
   - f/u vanc trough and dose by level
   3. Anemia:   B12 and folate have been recently normal.  Cause is likely
   [**2-15**] ESRD.   Hemolysis labs have been previously normal.  Also there is
   some concern for pulmonary hemmorhage as above.  She does have a

She has several medical complications that require ongoing management.

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a pulmonary-renal syndrome, as indicated by presumed positive p-ANCA. High-dose steroids have been started, and the patient's oxygenation on the ventilator is excellent.

   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD with renal failure and progressive
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Most likely cause is a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome given p-ANCA presumably positive.   High-dose
   steroids started yesterday given this likelihood.  ABG shows excellent
   oxygenation on current vent settings, so perhaps steroids are already
   having some effect.  Her chest CT looks improved from prior. Low
   suspcion for an infectious etiology (PCP and fungal markers have been
   negative); however, she remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - f/u culture data: all NGTD
   - f/u final ANCA
   - decrease FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated to maintain PaO2 >60
   - f/u final read chest CT
   - continue methylprednisolone 1 g q24h
   - continue vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime until tomorrow (day
   1=[**5-21**]), which will complete a 7-day course in case infectious etiology
   was at play
   - f/u Rheum recs; may discuss starting cytoxan
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  With nephrotic range proteinuria
   and a urinary protein gap.  However, UPEP without any significant
   Bence-[**Doctor Last Name 720**] protein, so myeloma less likely as a cause.  Vasculitis is
   the most likely cause, possibly related to pulmonary issues above.  As
   above, p-ANCA presumptively positive but pending.  Renal biopsy being
   done this morning will aid with diagnosis.  Meanwhile, for treatment,
   steroids started yesterday.
   - continue 1 g methylprednisolone q24h as above
   - follow urine output
   - f/u renal biopsy
   - renal recs
   - f/u vanc trough and dose by level
   3. Anemia:   Hematocrit bumped appropriately yesterday after two units
   of blood.  B12 and folate have been recently normal.  Cause is likely
   [**2-15**] ESRD.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] PPI
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct<2
   .
   4. Fever: Afebrile after a single T 101.2 yesterday morning.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   secondary to inflammatory/ vasculitic process.  Low suspicion for
   infection, already on broad-spectrum antibacterial coverage.
   - f/u blood cx
   5. MGUS:  Hematology following. SPEP and UPEP not suggestive of
   myeloma.
   .
   5. DM:  added lantus yesterday but hasn
t gotten first dose yet
   - Following fingersticks QACHS, insulin sliding scale goal <150
   6. CAD
   - statin, beta blocker, no [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discuss with renal if can start

   7. HTN:  After increasing metoprolol yesterday and adding Norvasc, BP
   is better controlled but currently mildly bradycardic.
   - decrease metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue nifedipine
   - would consider hydralazine PRN hypertension
   8. Hypothyroid

   Code status:  full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, and inflammatory lung disease who is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing progressive respiratory failure and required intubation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a pulmonary-renal syndrome, as indicated by the presumed positive p-ANCA. High-dose steroids have already been started, and the patient's ABG shows excellent oxygenation on current vent settings, suggesting that steroids may be having some effect. The chest CT also shows improvement from prior scans. Low suspicion for an infectious etiology, but the patient remains on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has nephrotic range proteinuria and a urinary protein gap, indicating acute renal failure. Vasculitis is the most likely cause, possibly related to the pulmonary issues mentioned above. A renal biopsy is being done to aid in diagnosis, and steroids have been started for treatment.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Blood transfusion has already been given, and further management will depend on the hematocrit levels.

4. Fever: The patient had a single episode of fever, which is likely secondary to an inflammatory or vasculitic process. Low suspicion for infection"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presented with progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, renal failure, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's medical complications include hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, acute renal failure, and possible pulmonary-renal vasculitic syndrome. She has been treated with pulse steroids, antibiotics, and other medications to address these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, infection (ICU-acquired), further decline in renal function, complications related to multiple myeloma (such as bone marrow suppression or infections), and cardiovascular events.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, blood counts, and electrolyte levels. Frequent assessments of oxygenation, ventilation, and fluid balance are necessary. The patient should continue to receive appropriate antibiotic therapy, renal supportive measures, and management for her underlying medical conditions.

Regular communication with the multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, hematologists/oncologists, and endocrinologists, is crucial to ensure optimal care and management of the patient's complex medical conditions."

   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD with renal failure and progressive
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Most likely cause is a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome given p-ANCA presumably positive.   High-dose
   steroids started yesterday given this likelihood.  ABG shows excellent
   oxygenation on current vent settings, so perhaps steroids are already
   having some effect.  Her chest CT looks improved from prior. Low
   suspcion for an infectious etiology (PCP and fungal markers have been
   negative); however, she remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - f/u culture data: all NGTD
   - f/u final ANCA
   - decrease FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated to maintain PaO2 >60
   - f/u final read chest CT
   - continue methylprednisolone 1 g q24h
   - continue vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime until tomorrow (day
   1=[**5-21**]), which will complete a 7-day course in case infectious etiology
   was at play
   - f/u Rheum recs; may discuss starting cytoxan
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  With nephrotic range proteinuria
   and a urinary protein gap.  However, UPEP without any significant
   Bence-[**Doctor Last Name 720**] protein, so myeloma less likely as a cause.  Vasculitis is
   the most likely cause, possibly related to pulmonary issues above.  As
   above, p-ANCA presumptively positive but pending.  Renal biopsy being
   done this morning will aid with diagnosis.  Meanwhile, for treatment,
   steroids started yesterday.
   - continue 1 g methylprednisolone q24h as above
   - follow urine output
   - f/u renal biopsy
   - renal recs
   - f/u vanc trough and dose by level
   3. Anemia:   B12 and folate have been recently normal.  Cause is likely
   [**2-15**] ESRD.   Hemolysis labs have been previously normal.  Also there is
   some concern for pulmonary hemmorhage as above.  She does have a
   history of gastritis but GI bleed is unlikely.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] PPI

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, MGUS, and inflammatory lung disease. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's recent history includes a positive ANCA test, indicating possible vasculitis, as well as a negative viral screen.

The patient's current treatment plan includes high-dose steroids for suspected pulmonary-renal syndrome and potential vasculitis, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and continued monitoring of blood cultures. A renal biopsy has been scheduled to aid in the diagnosis of renal failure. The patient's anemia is likely due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and she is being closely monitored for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of ARDS, progression of renal failure, infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections, and complications related to long-term steroid use. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, renal function, and infection parameters will be crucial in managing these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who is currently in the ICU. She has renal failure and is experiencing progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, multiple myeloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, activity intolerance, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, methylprednisolone, vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has hypoxemia, anemia, and fever. The renal biopsy is pending, and the patient's condition is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further, leading to worsening hypoxemia and potential complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may worsen, leading to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
3. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a risk of developing a new infection or the progression of an existing infection, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock.

   This 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and ILD with renal failure and progressive
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Most likely cause is a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome given p-ANCA presumably positive.   High-dose
   steroids started yesterday given this likelihood.  ABG shows excellent
   oxygenation on current vent settings, so perhaps steroids are already
   having some effect.  Her chest CT looks improved from prior. Low
   suspcion for an infectious etiology (PCP and fungal markers have been
   negative); however, she remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - f/u culture data: all NGTD
   - f/u final ANCA
   - decrease FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated to maintain PaO2 >60
   - f/u final read chest CT
   - continue methylprednisolone 1 g q24h
   - continue vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime until tomorrow (day
   1=[**5-21**]), which will complete a 7-day course in case infectious etiology
   was at play
   - f/u Rheum recs; may discuss starting cytoxan
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  With nephrotic range proteinuria
   and a urinary protein gap.  However, UPEP without any significant
   Bence-[**Doctor Last Name 720**] protein, so myeloma less likely as a cause.  Vasculitis is
   the most likely cause, possibly related to pulmonary issues above.  As
   above, p-ANCA presumptively positive but pending.  Renal biopsy being
   done this morning will aid with diagnosis.  Meanwhile, for treatment,
   steroids started yesterday.
   - continue 1 g methylprednisolone q24h as above
   - follow urine output
   - f/u renal biopsy
   - renal recs
   - f/u vanc trough and dose by level
   3. Anemia:   Hematocrit bumped appropriately yesterday after two units
   of blood.  B12 and folate have been recently normal.  Cause is likely
   [**2-15**] ESRD.
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] PPI
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct<2
   .
   4. Fever: Afebrile after a single T 101.2 yesterday morning.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   secondary to inflammatory/ vasculitic process.  Low suspicion for
   infection, already on broad-spectrum antibacterial coverage.
   - f/u blood cx
   5. MGUS:  Hematology following. SPEP and UPEP not suggestive of
   myeloma.
   .
   5. DM:  added lantus yesterday but hasn
t gotten first dose yet
   - Following fingersticks QACHS, insulin sliding scale goal <150
   6. CAD
   - statin, beta blocker, no [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discuss with renal if can start

   - holding [**Last Name (un) **] given ARF
   7. HTN:  After increasing metoprolol yesterday and adding Norvasc, BP
   is better controlled but currently mildly bradycardic.
   - decrease metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue nifedipine
   - would consider hydralazine PRN hypertension
   8. Hypothyroid
   - continue home dose levothyroxine, switched to liquid form

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who has renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. 

The patient is experiencing several medical complications, including:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The most likely cause is a pulmonary-renal syndrome given the presumed positive p-ANCA. High-dose steroids have been started, and the patient's chest CT looks improved from prior.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: With nephrotic range proteinuria and a urinary protein gap. Vasculitis is the most likely cause, possibly related to pulmonary issues above. A renal biopsy is being done to aid with diagnosis, and treatment with steroids has been initiated.
3. Anemia: The cause is likely end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Fever: The patient was febrile but is now afebrile after a single temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday morning. The fever could be secondary to an inflammatory/vasculitic process.
5. MGUS: Hematology follow-up is recommended, as SPEP and UPEP do not suggest myeloma.
6. DM: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored, and insulin sliding scale should be goal-directed to maintain blood glucose levels below 150 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She presented with acute renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be caused by a pulmonary-renal syndrome, indicated by positive p-ANCA/MPO. She has received high-dose steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and is currently on pressure support ventilation. There is a plan to extubate her tomorrow.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to crescentic glomerulonephritis. This is supported by the renal biopsy results and the presence of anti-GBM antibodies. The patient has been treated with methylprednisolone and may receive cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) as well.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could be secondary to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Blood transfusion and erythropoietin stimulating agents may be necessary.
4. Fever: The patient's fever has subsided after completing a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute renal failure. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and activity intolerance. Upon admission, the patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and placed on mechanical ventilation. Renal biopsy was performed, and p-ANCA/MPO was positive. The patient's vital signs show sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 58 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 125/47 mmHg to 170/69 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 95% on 40% FiO2. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,487 mL and output of 720 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and low hemoglobin. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.31, indicating respiratory acidosis. Imaging reveals an endotracheal tube placed 3 cm from the carina. The patient's condition remains stable, but complications such as pneumonia, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure are noted. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and renal nutrition support. Further tests, including renal biopsy results, ASO titer, and mini-BAL culture, are pending. The patient's code status is full code, and the ICU care includes prophylaxis for D"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, MGUS, and interstitial lung disease. She has been admitted to the ICU with renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary-renal syndrome, possibly either Goodpasture's syndrome or Wegener's granulomatosis. She has been started on Cytoxan, steroids, and IVF. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but all other cultures have been negative. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/58mmHg to 137/51mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O. Her ABG results show good oxygenation but a decreased PaO2 on PSV mode. 

Laboratory findings indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and low potassium levels. The patient's kidney function is impaired, and she has acute renal failure. The renal path shows crescentic glomerulonephritis, consistent with anti-"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She has been diagnosed with pulmonary-renal syndrome, likely due to Wegener's disease (positive p-ANCA/MPO). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to worsening hypoxemia and further deterioration in lung function.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to decline, resulting in worsening renal failure and the need for further intervention such as dialysis.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or other underlying causes. Blood transfusions may be required to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and the exact cause is unclear. Monitoring and managing fluid intake will be crucial to prevent further complications related to electroly imbalance.

5. Fever: Although the patient has been afebrile for 48 hours, there is still a low suspicion for infection. Monitoring blood cultures and continuing to evaluate for any signs of infection is important.

6. MGUS: The patient's MGUS should be closely monitored"

   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 7451**] is safely extubated an doing well. She has had issues with
   BP control overnight and an element of  PND. cytoxan has been started
   today and she has benefitted from low dose lasix to help with UO (
   nearly 1.8L)  pANCA positive in keeping with diagnosis of Wegener's..
   She is now on nasal canula O2.
   She does have diffuse exp wheezing. There is minimal ankle edema but
   marked edema in UE's

   BUN of 108. CXR with diffuse bilateral interstitial disease, minimal

   Agree with plan to gently diurese today and continue steroids and
   cytoxan. She will continue with antibiotics for now pending culture
   review. She will need aggressive BP control ( nifedipine vs norvasc)
   and close attention to glycemic issues too. She will likely leave the
   ICU later today if no setback on account of breathing

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress and potential medical complications:

Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to p-ANCA/MPO positive vasculitis. The patient underwent intubation and received high-dose steroids, antibiotics, and plasma exchange. She was successfully extubated and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which is likely due to pulmonary-renal syndrome associated with p-ANCA/MPO positive vasculitis. The patient has shown improvement with the use of high-dose steroids and antibiotics. However, she still requires close monitoring of her oxygenation levels and respiratory status.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal path shows crescentic glomerulonephritis, consistent with p-ANCA/MPO positive vasculitis. This indicates acute renal failure on top of chronic kidney disease. The patient is receiving solu-medrol and cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) for management of this condition. Regular monitoring of urine output and renal function is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). She presented with renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation, secondary to Wegner's granulomatosis (p-ANCA/MPO positive). The patient has been treated with high-dose steroids and a 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. She tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 0/5 well this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The most likely cause is a pulmonary-renal syndrome given p-ANCA/MPO positive. High-dose steroid treatment has been initiated, and the patient's chest CT showed improvement from prior. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been completed, and she is tolerating PSV 0/5 well this AM.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal path showing crescentic glomerulonephritis, consistent with Wegner's granulomatosis as suggested by p-ANCA/MPO positivity. Solumedrol and cytoxan have been prescribed, and follow-up will include monitoring urine output and renal recommendations.

3. Anemia: Hematocrit was bumped appropriately yesterday after two units of blood. B12 and folate levels have been recently normal, suggesting that the cause of anemia is likely end-stage renal disease (ES"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, and inflammatory lung disease. She presented to the ICU with renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with p-ANCA/MPO positive vasculitis.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, hypernatremia, and hypertension. The treatment plan includes high-dose steroids, antibiotics, and continued management of her underlying conditions such as diabetes, multiple myeloma, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of infections due to immunosuppression from steroids, and uncontrolled hypertension.

Overall, the patient is stable but requires close monitoring and continued management of her multiple medical conditions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presented with renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary-renal syndrome associated with Wegener's granulomatosis (p-ANCA/MPO positive) and has completed a course of high-dose steroids. She also had an improved chest CT and finished a 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) well this morning and is being considered for extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The most likely cause is a pulmonary-renal syndrome given the p-ANCA/MPO positive results. The patient's respiratory function needs close monitoring, especially after extubation.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal path showing crescentic glomerulonephritis, consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to manage the renal failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is important to monitor the patient's hematocrit levels and consider blood transfusions if necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The etiology of the patient's hypernatremia is unclear"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who has been admitted to the ICU with renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary renal syndrome, specifically ANCA/MPO positive vasculitis. The patient's conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, hypernatremia, MGUS, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to PANCA/MPO positive vasculitis. There is a potential complication of worsening respiratory failure leading to further hypoxia and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal failure is associated with crescentic glomerulonephritis. There is a potential complication of further deterioration in renal function, leading to the need for dialysis or renal transplantation.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss or decreased production of red blood cells. This could lead to symptomatic anemia and the need for blood transfusions.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen if fluid intake does not match fluid output,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note, but there are several significant events and changes in medication.

The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications, including Cipro, Cardura, Codeine, Bactrim, and Augmentin. The last dose of antibiotics administered was Lasix, hydralazine, and heparin sodium.

The vital signs show a high blood pressure reading of 156/77 mmHg, with fluctuations throughout the day. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is no mention of pulse or respiratory rate. The oxygen saturation level is 93% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,940 mL and output of 3,450 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,510 mL. The urine output is also noted as 3,450 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and blood glucose levels. The creatinine level is elevated, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging shows diffuse basilar opacity on chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia. The assessment and plan include hypoxemia, pneumonia, anemia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, multiple myeloma, hypertension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presented with renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was diagnosed with pulmonary renal syndrome consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis, also known as ANCA-associated vasculitis (PANCA/MPO positive). The patient has been treated with pulse dose methylprednisolone, atovaquone PPX, and cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) with intravenous fluids (IVF). She also has acute on chronic renal failure with crescentic glomerulonephritis, anemia likely due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), MGUS, DM, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of respiratory symptoms if her underlying pulmonary condition is not adequately managed.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with acute exacerbations. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, leading to AKI or progression to ESRD.
3. Infection: Immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and cyclophosphamide increases the risk of infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes, MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), and ILD (interstitial lung disease) who has been admitted to the ICU with renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary renal syndrome consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis (also known as ANCA-associated vasculitis). The patient is currently extubated and doing well on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further, leading to worsening hypoxemia and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to decline, leading to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tissue perfusion.
4. MGUS: Although the patient's SPEP and UPEP do not currently suggest myeloma, long-term steroid use may increase the risk of progression to multiple myeloma.
5. DM (diabetes mellitus): The patient's glycemic control may be challenging due to the use of steroids, which can increase blood glucose levels. This may lead to hyperglycemia and related complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), and interstitial lung disease. She presented with renal failure and progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation, secondary to PANCA/MPO positive vasculitis, also known as Wegener's granulomatosis. The patient is currently extubated and doing well on a nasal cannula. She remains on treatment, awaiting clarification from rheumatology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's short episodes of tachypnea and crackles in the lung fields suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. Diuretics may be necessary to manage fluid accumulation and improve respiratory function.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has crescentic glomerulonephritis consistent with PANCA/MPO positive vasculitis. Close monitoring of renal function and follow-up urine output are essential. Renal biopsies may be considered to assess the severity and guide treatment.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has stabilized post-transfusion. Further evaluation for the cause of anemia is recommended, as it could be related to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Haptoglobin levels should be monitored to rule out hemolysis.
4. MGUS: No changes are noted in the patient's MGUS. Regular monitoring is necessary to detect any progression to multiple my"
