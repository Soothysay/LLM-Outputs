   # Sepsis
 Staph aureus in blood cx bottles from ED. MRI consistent
   with embolic shower.  LP by IR showed WBC of 345.  This likely due to
   septic emboli and likely with embolic infarcts explains seizures.
   - check TEE given fever, and high likelihood of endocarditis given
   embolic shower on MRI.
   - Continue Vanc, Amp
   -  f/u blood cx and sensitivities
   - fluids and pressors to maintain MAP>65

   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.1.
   - Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # Anemia - baseline low 32-33, but trending down to 25.5 this AM in
   setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be concern for
   hemolysis, but no schistocytes on smear and Haptoglobin <20.
   - cycle HCT in AM.
   - guaic stools.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology,
   lactate trending down with IVF, with appropriate respiratory
   compensation.

","Summary:
- Patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis.
- She presented with a febrile seizure and was found to have multiple cortical infarcts on MRI, concerning for emboli.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection during a post-ictal state.
- She has hypotension secondary to sepsis, for which aggressive fluid resuscitation is being continued.
- There are signs of possible hemolysis, but no schistocytes on smear.
- The patient has acute kidney injury with a baseline creatinine of 1.2-1.7 and currently up to 2.1.
- Metabolic acidosis is also present, likely due to septic shock and lactate production.
- The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease with previous aortic valve replacement (AVR) and mitral valve replacement (MVR).
- She is on heparin, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been planned given the high likelihood of endocarditis.
- The patient's blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus, and she is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: Given the history of rheumatic heart disease and the presence of multiple embolic events, endocarditis is a concern. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Seizure - ddx includes infection, toxic/metabolic, intracranial
   process (evidence of prior ischemia on CT HEAD).  given fever,
   leukocytosis, bandemia, an infectious etiology, particularly
   meningitis, seems most likely.  No other foci of infection presently
   (CXR with LLL atelectasis, UA weakly+).  Urine tox screen negative.
   CT HEAD without bleeding or mass, though old evidence of infarcts.
   Would proceed as follows:
   - appreciate neuro recs.
   - dilantin load not completed in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will recheck dilantin level now
   and re-load.
   - continue dilatinin 100mg IV Q8HR (next dose 8 HRS after load), check
   dilantin level prior to next dose (check LFTs, albumin).
   - plan for MRI/MRA in AM, preferably with Gadolinium per NEURO, but if
   not possible, ok to get without.
   - no EEG for now (clear clinical history), will check if evidence of
   ongoing seizure activity.
   - continue acyclovir.
   - start empiric listeria coverage pending culture data.
   - add-on LFTs, check UCx, DFA, trend lactate in AM.
   - stop coumadin, start heparin gtt, anticipate reversing INR with FFP
   for LP in AM (?with IR given anticoagulation issues), however given
   mechanical MVR, will discuss optimal strategy with cardiology in AM
   (courtesy).
   - check CDIFF given ?loose stool (covered in stool)
   - check TTE given fever, prosthetic valves.
   - check CK given seizure and ARF.
   .
   .
   # Hyponatremia - likely dehydrated in setting of fevers, will hydrate
   overnight as above, and follow in AM.
   - check Sosm, Uosm, Ulytes in AM.
   .
   # Hypotension - relative hypotension after getting propofol in ED, now
   with BPs trending down to high 90s after 4-5L IVF.  most likely
   represents septic physiology, though both propofol and dilantin can
   also cause hypotension.
   - continue IVF resuscitation (lactate responded nicely to IVF).
   - place a-line now.
   - if remains borderline hypotensive, will place CVL in AM.
   - continue broad spectrum abx.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis presenting with febrile seizure. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple cortical infarcts in the brain, suspected emboli, and possible chronic hemolysis from a valve. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, hyponatremia, anemia, metabolic acidosis, and rheumatic heart disease with prosthetic valves. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has received blood products, broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and is planned for TEE, MRI/MRA, and other tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, bandemia, and evidence of infection on urine toxic screen suggest an infectious etiology, particularly meningitis. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but further investigation and treatment are necessary.
2. Seizure: The patient's recent febrile seizure and evidence of prior ischemia on CT HEAD indicate a high risk for recurrent seizures. The patient is currently receiving anticonvulsants, but the dosage may need adjustment, and an EEG may be required to monitor ongoing seizure activity.
3. Hemolysis: The patient's decreasing hematocrit levels and absence of schistocytes on smear raise concerns for hemolysis. Further investigation, including urine hemosiderin"

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Sepsis
 Staph aureus in [**4-9**] blood cx bottles from ED [**6-7**]. MRI
   consistent with embolic shower.  LP by IR showed WBC of 345.  This
   likely due to septic emboli and likely embolic infarcts explains
   seizures.
   - check TEE given fever, and high likelihood of endocarditis given
   embolic shower on MRI.
   - Continue Vanc, Amp, CTX, add gent for synergy. D/C acv as low
   likelihood of HSV and poor creatinine clearance
   -  f/u blood cx and sensitivities (MRSA swab from nose positive so
   higher likelihood it will be MRSA)
   - fluids and pressors to maintain MAP>65
   - F/U CSF cultures
   - contact cardiac surgery if not done yet
   # Seizures
 likely explained by septic emboli. LP by IR with elevated
   WBC.
   - appreciate neuro recs.
   - dilantin loaded here and will have level this AM
   - Continue empiric listeria coverage pending culture data.
   - f/u CSF cx.
   - Goal SBP 100-160
   # Hypotension
 Etiology secondary to sepsis. BPs trending down to high
   90s after 4-5L IVF in ED.  CVL was placed and aggressive fluid
   resuscitation was intiated however she required levophed to maintain
   SBP 100-160 per neuro recs.  .
   - CVL and A-line in place.
   - continue pressor support as needed
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   # Respiratory
 Oxygenating well. Will decrease FiO2. Over-breathing
   vent
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.1.
   - Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - monitor UOP and Cr
   - D/C ACV
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   # Anemia - baseline low 32-33, but trending down to 25.5 this AM in
   setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be concern for
   hemolysis, but no schistocytes on smear and Haptoglobin <20.
   - cycle HCT Q8H
   - guaic stools.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology,
   lactate trending down with IVF, with appropriate respiratory
   compensation.
   - repeat CHEM7 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].
   - continue plaquenil.
   .
   # Rheumatic heart disease, s/p AVR, MVR - clinically euvolemic on exam.
   - continue heparin
   - TEE as above
   .
   # HTN - hold coreg, valsartan and lisinopril given hypotension and mild
   ARF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis. She presented with a febrile seizure and was found to have sepsis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. She also has multiple cortical infarcts in the brain, indicating possible embolic shower, which could be related to endocarditis. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. She has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 25.4 g/dL, likely due to hemolysis. Her renal function is compromised with an elevated baseline creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and currently up to 2.1 mg/dL. She also has metabolic acidosis with a lactate level of 17.4 K/uL.

The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ampicillin, and gentamicin. She is also receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressor support to maintain her mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis-related organ failure syndrome (SOFS) - due to the ongoing sepsis, the patient is at risk of developing further organ dysfunction.
2. Endocarditis - given the presence of multiple embolic showers on MRI, there is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis presenting with febrile seizure. She has multiple cortical infarcts on MRI, suggesting embolic shower, likely due to septic emboli. The patient is currently in the ICU with the following medical complications:

1. Sepsis: Staphylococcus aureus detected in blood culture bottles, indicating a bacterial infection that could have caused the febrile seizure and subsequent embolic infarcts.

2. Seizures: Explained by septic emboli, likely due to the underlying infection.

3. Hypotension: Caused by sepsis, with blood pressures trending down despite aggressive fluid resuscitation.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): Baseline creatinine levels ranging from 1.2-1.7 mg/dL, currently up to 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's low hemoglobin levels may be indicative of hemolysis, but no schistocytes observed on smear.

5. Anemia: Trending down to 25.5% this morning, which could be related to aggressive fluid resuscitation or ongoing hemolysis.

6. Metabolic acidosis: Likely due to lactic acidosis and infectious etiology, with appropriate respiratory compensation.

7. Rheumatic heart disease: The patient had previous aortic valve"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis presenting with febrile seizure. She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. 

The patient has multiple cortical infarcts on MRI, concerning for emboli. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to assess for endocarditis given the high likelihood of this diagnosis due to the embolic shower seen on MRI.

The patient received four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and underwent an interventional radiology (IR)-guided lumbar puncture (LP). The LP results showed an elevated white blood cell count of 345, which is consistent with septic emboli. 

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and ampicillin. The antibiotics will continue to be administered.

The patient's blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. 

The patient is also being treated for seizures, likely explained by the septic emboli. Dilantin has been loaded, and the level will be checked in the morning. Acyclovir will also be continued.

The patient's blood pressure has been trending down, possibly due to septic physiology, but also potentially related to propofol and dilantin. Intravenous fluids (IVF) will be continued, and a central venous line (CVL) may be placed"

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Sepsis
 Staph aureus in blood cx bottles from ED. MRI consistent
   with embolic shower.  LP by IR showed WBC of 345.  This likely due to
   septic emboli and likely with embolic infarcts explains seizures.
   - check TEE given fever, and high likelihood of endocarditis given
   embolic shower on MRI.
   - Continue Vanc, Amp
   -  f/u blood cx and sensitivities
   - fluids and pressors to maintain MAP>65
   .
   # Seizures
 likely explained by septic emboli. LP by IR with elevated
   WBC.
   - appreciate neuro recs.
   - dilantin loaded hear and will have level this AM
   - continue acyclovir.
   - Continue empiric listeria coverage pending culture data.
   - f/u CSF cx.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Etiology secondary to sepsis. BPs trending down to high
   90s after 4-5L IVF in ED.  CVL was placed and aggressive fluid
   resuscitation was intiated.  .
   - CVL and A-line in place.
   - continue IVF resuscitation (lactate responded nicely to IVF).
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   .
   # Respiratory
 intubated for airway protection during post-ictal
   state.
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   .
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.1.
   - Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # Anemia - baseline low 32-33, but trending down to 25.5 this AM in
   setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be concern for
   hemolysis, but no schistocytes on smear and Haptoglobin <20.
   - cycle HCT in AM.
   - guaic stools.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology,
   lactate trending down with IVF, with appropriate respiratory
   compensation.
   - repeat CHEM7 in AM.
   - repeat ABG in AM.
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].

   prosthesis leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet
   mitral valve prosthesis is present. The motion of the mitral valve
   prosthetic leaflets appears normal. A paravalvular mitral prosthesis
   leak is present. There is an approximately 2 cm x 0.4 cm mobile
   vegetation attached to the anterior aspect of the suture ring of the
   mitral valve (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A tricuspid valve
   annuloplasty ring is present. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
   is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the
   body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size
   is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
   normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the
   incisors. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension in
   the setting of intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis. She was admitted to the ICU with febrile seizures, and subsequent tests revealed positive blood cultures for MRSA. She has a bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with a vegetation on it, causing mild mitral regurgitation. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, gentamicin, and ceftriaxone for bacterial endocarditis. Her condition is complicated by septic shock, seizures, acute renal failure, anemia, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infective endocarditis: The patient's positive blood cultures and vegetation on the prosthetic mitral valve indicate an ongoing infection. This can lead to further complications such as embolic strokes or systemic spread of the infection.
2. Septic shock: The patient's requirement for pressors and unstable blood pressure suggest septic shock. This condition can progress to organ failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output indicate renal impairment. If left untreated, it can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels may be due to hemolysis or blood loss. It is important to monitor and treat this condition to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate levels and high lactate levels suggest metabolic acidosis. This condition needs to be corrected to prevent organ dysfunction.
6. Seizures: The patient's seizures may be due to septic emboli or other underlying causes. Monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further seizures and potential brain damage.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's over-breathing on the ventilator may lead to respiratory alkalosis or fatigue. Adjustments to the ventilator settings and close monitoring are needed to ensure adequate gas exchange.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications and improve her chances of recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, chronic anemia, and fever of unknown origin. She is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, and status epilepticus. The patient has a bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with an adjacent vegetation, well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, and tricuspid annuloplasty ring. She is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 128/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The presence of vegetation on the mitral valve prosthesis increases the risk of bacterial endocarditis. The patient's positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA suggest a potential infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures indicate the possibility of sepsis. The presence of multiple comorbidities, such as chronic renal failure and anemia, can worsen the prognosis.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): While the patient's respiratory"

   fentanyl bolus PRNinstead today
   - Will check ABG this am->adjust settings appropriately
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need trach soon. Will cls thoracics in next few days.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Unclear etiology for increased bicarb given net
   pos.
   - Check urine anion gap->likely secondary to fluid resusitation
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.2. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   prerenal as pt mildly tachycardic and with large amt of insensible
   losses

   - Monitor vanc/gent levels
   - Monitor UOP, Cr, CVP
   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline low 32-33, trended down to 25 on [**6-8**] in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation but stable around 25 since. Concern for
   hemolysis given haptoglobin <20, but no schistocytes on smear. Of note,
   question of hemolysis has come up in past for haptoglobin <20; may have
   shearing by mechanical valves although urine hemosiderin neg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis. She presented with febrile seizures and was diagnosed with infective endocarditis, confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The patient has prosthetic mitral valve with resultant mitral regurgitation (MR). She is currently on antibiotics (vancomycin and gentamicin) and will have blood cultures and sensitivities followed up. Rifampin will be added today.

The patient is also experiencing septic shock, which has responded well to fluid resuscitation. Pressor requirements have been discontinued. Her blood pressure (BP) and central venous pressure (CVP) are stable. The goal BP range is 100-160 mmHg per neuro recommendations.

The patient had seizures likely explained by septic emboli. Lumbar puncture (LP) was performed with elevated white blood cells (WBC). The patient is on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and CSF cultures will be followed up.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient was over-breathing on the ventilator yesterday. Propofol with fentanyl bolus will be given PRN instead today. ABG will be checked, and settings will be adjusted accordingly. A tracheostomy is needed soon, and thoracics will be closed in the next few days.

The patient has metabolic alkal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
- She has been diagnosed with infective endocarditis, confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showing vegetations on a prosthetic mitral valve and resulting mitral regurgitation.
- The patient is currently in septic shock, requiring pressor support, and is being treated with vancomycin and gentamicin.
- She also has seizures, likely explained by septic emboli, and is on antiepileptic drugs.
- The patient has respiratory issues, with over-breathing on the ventilator, and requires adjustments in settings based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results.
- She is experiencing metabolic alkalosis with an unclear etiology, and her kidney function is compromised, possibly due to acute renal failure.
- The patient has anemia, which may be related to hemolysis, and requires monitoring and further evaluation.
- She also has metabolic acidosis, likely caused by lactate and infectious etiology.
- The patient's SLE with lupus nephritis is not actively flaring at the moment.
- ICU care includes nutrition through tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued septic shock: The patient's pressor requirements are decreasing, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her blood pressure.
2. Endocarditis complications: The presence of vegetations on the prosthetic mitral valve increases the risk of further embolic events, heart failure, or other complications related to infective endocarditis.
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient's seizures may recur, and it is important to monitor her neurological status and adjust antiepileptic drug dosages as necessary.
4. Respiratory complications: Over-breathing on the ventilator may lead to respiratory alkalosis or muscle fatigue. Adjustments in the ventilator settings should be made based on ABG results.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's metabolic alkalosis and to guide appropriate treatment.
6. Acute renal failure: Close monitoring of renal function, fluid balance, and medication levels is essential to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.
7. Anemia and possible hemolysis: The cause of the patient's anemia needs to be investigated further, and appropriate management should be implemented.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The underlying cause of the patient's metabolic acidosis should be identified and managed appropriately.
9. SLE flare: Although not actively flaring at the moment, the patient's SLE with lupus nephritis should be closely monitored for any signs of exacerbation.

The patient's condition is complex"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by endocarditis, septic shock, seizures, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), anemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Infective endocarditis: The patient has confirmed vegetations on her prosthetic mitral valve, leading to mitral regurgitation. This increases the risk of embolic events and further complications such as stroke or organ damage.

2. Septic shock: The patient is still requiring vasopressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. There is a risk of recurrent septic shock if the infection is not adequately controlled.

3. Seizures: The patient experienced a febrile seizure, and ongoing seizure activity may continue due to septic emboli or other causes. Antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin or levetiracetam should be continued, and close monitoring for seizure recurrence is necessary.

4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory distress. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to underlying lung pathology and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has an elevated baseline"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of unknown origin fever, chronic renal failure, seizure with status epilepticus, metabolic acidosis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction and has a history of chronic anemia and fever of unknown origin. 

The patient's 24-hour events include the recommendation to start rifampin in a few days, checking gentamicin and vancomycin levels daily due to increasing GFR, discontinuing plaquenil as advised by the rheumatologist, receiving 1500 mL of NS total and BPs up, CVL at 12, and I/O at ~1.5 at 9 pm. The EEG showed no seizure activity but indicated slowing consistent with encephalopathy. The gentamicin dosage was increased to Q12H due to a level of 0.8 (goal 1-7). Pm lytes were worsening, and bicarb was being checked. The patient went back on fentanyl gtt because of HTN/tachy.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were acyclovir on 03/06/2023 at 08:30 AM, ampicillin on 03/06/2023 at 05:38 AM, vancomycin on 03/06/2023 at 08:37 AM, ceftriaxone on 03/06/2023 at 08:38 AM, and gentamicin on 03/06/2023 at 05:12 PM.

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium at a rate of 1400 units/hour and other ICU medications including fentanyl. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data as of 03/11/2023 06:07 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, low total CO2 levels, high glucose levels, and abnormal liver function test results. Other lab results include elevated PT/PTT/INR, elevated CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, slightly elevated ALT/AST, low alk phos/T bilirubin, low amylase/lipase, normal lactic acid levels, low albumin levels, high LDH levels, normal calcium/magnesium/phosphate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, chronic anemia, fever of unknown origin, seizure with status epilepticus, metabolic acidosis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and lines management. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending."

   # Asystolic pause: Patient had 15 s pause without BP which
   spontaneously converted back to sinus afterward.  Pacer pads were
   placed.   EP consulted to place temp pacing wire this AM, but family
   was consulted and decided against this invasive procedure
   - family mtg to discuss goals of care.
   # Endocarditis: TEE with confirmed veg on prosthetic MV and resultant
   MR. [**First Name (Titles) 9238**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9239**] in [**4-9**] blood cx bottles from ED [**6-7**]. MRI consistent
   with embolic shower.  Currently not candidate for ct surgery but
   possibly after 6 weeks abx.
   - Continue vanc, gent and rifampin .
   - F/u CSF cultures
   - Daily EKG showed further prolongation of PR today.  15 s pause as
   above.
   - Appreciate ID input.
   # Seizures: likely explained by septic emboli. LP showed meningitis.
   - Appreciate neuro input; f/u recs
   - Continue Dilantin; follow levels and adjust dose as indicated
   - F/u CSF cx; abx as above
   - Goal SBP 100-160
   # Respiratory: Over-breathing vent yesterday. Will try propofol with
   fentanyl bolus PRN instead today
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need trach soon pending family mtg for goals of care.
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently stable at 2.1. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   prerenal as pt mildly tachycardic and with large amt of insensible
   losses
   - Monitor vanc/gent levels
   - Monitor UOP, Cr, CVP
   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline low 32-33, trended down to 25 on [**6-8**] in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation but stable around 25 since. Concern for
   hemolysis given haptoglobin <20, but no schistocytes on smear. Of note,
   question of hemolysis has come up in past for haptoglobin <20; may have
   shearing by mechanical valves although urine hemosiderin neg.
   - Cycle HCT daily
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - Not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by nephritis. She presents with febrile seizure, fever of 101.5°F, and evidence of endocarditis on a prosthetic mitral valve with resultant mitral regurgitation. The patient has chronic renal failure and chronic anemia. She also has respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including vancomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin for the suspected endocarditis. She continues to have fever and her daily EKG shows further prolongation of the PR interval. The patient's seizure is likely due to septic emboli, and her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows meningitis.

The patient's renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. She has anemia with a baseline low hemoglobin level of 32-33, which has trended down to 25. There is concern for hemolysis given the low haptoglobin level, but no schistocytes on smear. 

The patient's nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding, and she is receiving prophylactic medications"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, anemia, and seizure disorder. On admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 101.5°F. EKGs showed PR prolongation, and the patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation with a 15-second asystolic pause. The patient was converted to sinus rhythm and pacer pads were placed. The patient also made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

24-hour events include the addition of rifampin, which did not alleviate the fever. The patient experienced an episode of ventricular tachycardia, resulting in cardiac arrest, and was successfully resuscitated. The patient's blood pressure remains unstable, requiring vasopressor support. The patient continues to have persistent fever and is now on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 40%. ABG results show a mixed acid-base disorder.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,132 mL and output of 1,755 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 377 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's CVP is 10 mmHg, and peripheral pulses are not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been febrile since [**2203-6-11**] and has developed a first-degree AV block. The patient also has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic anemia, and seizure with status epilepticus. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a respiratory support system. The patient's physical examination reveals sclera anicteric, clear lung sounds, and 1+ faint pulses with dopplerable PT pulses. Neurological examination shows a sluggish right pupil, withdrawal to pain in the lower extremities, upward-going toes bilaterally on Babinski sign, and minimal arousal to sternal rub.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizure recurrence due to the patient's history of seizure with status epilepticus.
2. Worsening of the first-degree AV block, which could lead to complete heart block and bradycardia.
3. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's respiratory failure.
4. Progression of chronic renal failure, which may"

   with embolic shower.  Currently not candidate for ct surgery but
   possibly after 6 weeks abx.
   - Continue vanc, gent; monitor levels. D/c ampicillin; also d/c ctx as
   no gram negs
   - Add rifampin today
   - F/u blood cx and sensitivities (MRSA swab from nose positive so
   higher likelihood it will be MRSA).
   - F/u CSF cultures
   - Daily EKG showed prolonged PR today->cls cards for PR prolongation
   and ?temp ppm wire
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Appreciate ID input; Will check vanc peak and trough per their recs.
   # Asystolic pause: Patient had 15 s pause without BP which
   spontaneously converted back to sinus afterward.
   - Pacer pads in place
   - EP to place temp pacing wire this AM
   # Seizures: likely explained by septic emboli. LP showed meningitis.
   - Appreciate neuro input; f/u recs
   - Continue Dilantin; follow levels and adjust dose as indicated
   - F/u CSF cx; abx as above
   - Goal SBP 100-160

   fentanyl bolus PRNinstead today
   - Will check ABG this am->adjust settings appropriately
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need trach soon. Will cls thoracics in next few days.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Unclear etiology for increased bicarb given net

   # Anemia: Baseline low 32-33, trended down to 25 on [**6-8**] in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation but stable around 25 since. Concern for
   hemolysis given haptoglobin <20, but no schistocytes on smear. Of note,
   question of hemolysis has come up in past for haptoglobin <20; may have
   shearing by mechanical valves although urine hemosiderin neg.
   - Cycle HCT daily

   1)ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL-_Careful discussions as to what is medically
   possible and appropriate in this setting of severe valvular compromise,
   mult-focal endocarditis, significant and extensive embolic phenomona
   within the CNS and now with significant impairment in the conduction
   system integrity.  Surgery has not been offered as reasonable in this
   setting and we have medical management with incomplete response and
   even worsening of consequences of the infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with MRSA endocarditis, mechanical valves, and bioprosthesis. She has experienced complications related to the endocarditis, including fevers, worsening conduction delay, and intermittent asystole. Surgery has not been deemed appropriate due to severe valvular compromise, mult-focal endocarditis, extensive embolic phenomena in the CNS, and impairment in the conduction system. The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin and rifampin. She also has respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorders, sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, chronic anemia, fever of unknown origin, status epilepticus, metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis complications: The patient's endocarditis is causing ongoing complications, including fevers, worsening conduction delay, and intermittent asystole. These complications can lead to further deterioration in heart function and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which may require continued mechanical ventilation support. Failure to improve respiratory function could result in prolonged ventilation dependence or even death.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which can affect various organ functions and overall health. If not managed"
