   Assessment and Plan
   78yo female with history of multiple medical problems including type 2
   diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea s/p trach
   placement, and breast cancer was admitted with leukocytosis most likely
   related to C. diff and acute renal failure.
   .
   1. Leukocytosis/c diff +: Pt found to be c diff positive. Given her
   multiple recent hospitalizations and her multiple comorbidities, she is
   certainly at risk for many infections, including pulmonary, GU, or
   bloodstream infections. Plan is the following:
   - continue to treat her C. diff with IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin
   for 14 day course
   - follow-up blood and urine culture
   - follow-up final read of CT Abd/Pelvis and CXR
   .
   2. Concern for sepsis:  Pt dropped SBP to high 70s responding to
   repeated fluid bolus.  Her baseline BPs 110-130s.  Borderline needing
   pressor but no current central access.
   -give FFP (INR 2.4) and then place PICC line vs IJ. Prefer PICC line
   given PEEP and risk for PTX.
   -f/u blood cx
   -maintain Map>60
   -consider A line placement
   .
   3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Could be secondary to mental
   status.  Also pt has obesity and OSA.
   -pt placed back on ventilator, get afternoon ABG
   -increasing PEEP given obesity
   -follow daily CXR
   -change PO meds to IV
   .
   4. AMS: Worse this AM likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Pt more responsive to family than physicians and thus it is difficult
   to access her mental status.  Monitor today.  If worsens would consider
   LP but afebrile now and no meningeal signs.
   .
   5. Acute Renal Failure
   Patient is in renal failure with creatinine elevated to 2.2 from 1.1 on
   admission and is down to 2 today. Etiology is unclear but is concerning
   for ATN in the setting of hypotension given marked elevation in
   creatinine over 24 hours and given BUN/Creatinine ratio of [**10-7**]:1.
   Prerenal etiology related to dehydration is also possible. No
   additional history to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   - check urine lytes
   - fluid resuscitate to maintain UOP
    .
   5. Hypernatremia: Resolved overnight with D5W
   .
   6. H/o Breast Cancer: Did not get arimidex given pt now on vent and not
   taking POs
   7. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Patient has a history of T2DM and was only
   on insulin sliding scale.
   - continue humalog sliding scale, consider insulin gtt if sugar is not
   well controlled
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI
   .
   9. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - continue simvastatin
   10. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. She was recently
   restarted on coumadin after her recent admission for GI bleed.
   -d/c coumadin for today given pt needs central access, reverse INR with
   FFP today but would not given vit K
   .
   FEN: replete K+ and Mg and get PM lytes
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   78yo female with history of multiple medical problems including type 2
   diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea s/p trach
   placement, and breast cancer was admitted with leukocytosis most likely
   related to C. diff and acute renal failure.
   .
   1. Leukocytosis:
   Etiology of her leukocytosis is most likely related to C. diff
   infection as per [**Hospital 12**] Rehab report. Given her multiple recent
   hospitalizations and her multiple comorbidities, she is certainly at
   risk for many infections, including pulmonary, GU, or bloodstream
   infections. Plan is the following:
   - continue to treat her C. diff with IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin
   - follow-up blood and urine culture
   - follow-up final read of CT Abd/Pelvis and CXR
   - will broaden antibiotics if additional symptoms
   C. diff, ? PNA, ? UTI
   - continue vanc and flagyl
   - follow-up UA / culture
   - follow-up blood culture
   - follow-up final read of CT Abd/Pelvis and CXR
   - if blood cultures are positive, will need to pull PICC line
   2. Acute Renal Failure
   Patient is in renal failure with creatinine elevated to 2.2 from 1.1.
   Etiology is unclear but is concerning for ATN in the setting of
   hypotension given marked elevation in creatinine over 24 hours and
   given BUN/Creatinine ratio of [**10-7**]:1. Prerenal etiology related to
   dehydration is also possible. No additional history to suggest
   post-renal obstruction.
   - check urine lytes
   - fluid resuscitate
   3. C. diff
   Patient was reportedly found to have C. diff per [**Hospital 12**] Rehab records,
   likely explaining her marked leukocytosis and abdominal pain.
   - treat C. diff as above with vanc / flagyl
   4. Hypernatremia
   Patient has hypernatremia likely related to dehydration in the setting
   of diarrhea, infection, and increased insensible losses. Patient
   appears hypovolemic and hypernatremic. Plan is the following:
   - will fluid resuscitate with normal saline to aim for MAP > 55
   - will aim to correct hypernatremia with D5W as well
   5. h/o Breast Cancer
   Stable
   - continue arimidex
   6. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   Patient has a history of T2DM and was only on insulin sliding scale.
   - continue humalog sliding scale
   7. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI
   .
   8. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - continue simvastatin
   9. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. She was recently
   restarted on coumadin after her recent admission for GI bleed.
   - continue coumadin

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of multiple medical problems including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, breast cancer, and recent tracheostomy placement. She was admitted with leukocytosis most likely related to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and acute renal failure. The patient has been treated with IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin for C. diff, and her blood and urine cultures are pending. Her acute renal failure is of unclear etiology but may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or prerenal dehydration. She also has hypernatremia, likely related to dehydration, and her other medical conditions such as breast cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, GERD, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation are stable and being managed accordingly. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and prophylactic measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to her recent hospitalizations, tracheostomy placement, and compromised immune system.
2. Bloodstream infection: With a central line in place, there is a risk of bloodstream infection if proper precautions are not taken.
3. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary catheter increases the risk of urinary tract infection.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given her recent respiratory issues and possible"

   [**4-17**] C Diff - Negative
   Assessment and Plan
   78yo female with history of multiple medical problems including type 2
   diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea s/p trach
   placement, and breast cancer was admitted with leukocytosis most likely
   related to C. diff and acute renal failure.
   .
   1. Leukocytosis/c diff +: Pt found to be c diff positive. Given her
   multiple recent hospitalizations and her multiple comorbidities, she is
   certainly at risk for many infections, including pulmonary, GU, or
   bloodstream infections. Plan is the following:
   - continue to treat her C. diff with IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin
   for 14 day course
   - follow-up blood and urine culture
   - follow-up final read of CT Abd/Pelvis and CXR
   .
   2. Concern for sepsis:  Pt dropped SBP to high 70s responding to
   repeated fluid bolus.  Her baseline BPs 110-130s.  Borderline needing
   pressor but no current central access.
   -give FFP (INR 2.4) and then place PICC line vs IJ. Prefer PICC line
   given PEEP and risk for PTX.
   -f/u blood cx
   -maintain Map>60
   -consider A line placement
   .
   3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Could be secondary to mental
   status.  Also pt has obesity and OSA.
   -pt placed back on ventilator, get afternoon ABG
   -increasing PEEP given obesity
   -follow daily CXR
   -change PO meds to IV
   .
   4. AMS: Worse this AM likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Pt more responsive to family than physicians and thus it is difficult
   to access her mental status.  Monitor today.  If worsens would consider
   LP but afebrile now and no meningeal signs.
   .
   5. Acute Renal Failure
   Patient is in renal failure with creatinine elevated to 2.2 from 1.1 on
   admission and is down to 2 today. Etiology is unclear but is concerning
   for ATN in the setting of hypotension given marked elevation in
   creatinine over 24 hours and given BUN/Creatinine ratio of [**10-7**]:1.
   Prerenal etiology related to dehydration is also possible. No
   additional history to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   - check urine lytes
   - fluid resuscitate to maintain UOP
    .
   5. Hypernatremia: Resolved overnight with D5W
   .
   6. H/o Breast Cancer: Did not get arimidex given pt now on vent and not
   taking POs
   7. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Patient has a history of T2DM and was only
   on insulin sliding scale.
   - continue humalog sliding scale, consider insulin gtt if sugar is not
   well controlled
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI
   .
   9. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - continue simvastatin
   10. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. She was recently
   restarted on coumadin after her recent admission for GI bleed.
   -d/c coumadin for today given pt needs central access, reverse INR with
   FFP today but would not given vit K

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea post tracheostomy placement, and breast cancer. She was admitted with leukocytosis most likely related to C. diff and acute renal failure.

1. Leukocytosis/C. diff positive: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff and is at risk for various infections, including pulmonary, GU, or bloodstream infections. The plan includes continuing IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin for a 14-day course, following-up with blood and urine cultures, and reviewing imaging results.

2. Concern for sepsis: The patient's blood pressure dropped to the high 70s, responding to repeated fluid boluses. She is borderline needing pressor support but does not have central access yet. The plan is to give fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and place a PICC line instead of an internal jugular line due to the risk of pneumothorax. Follow-up blood cultures, maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and consider arterial line placement.

3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient may have hypercarbic respiratory failure due to mental status changes, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. The plan is to place her back on the ventilator, get an afternoon arterial blood gas (ABG), increase positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) given obesity,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, tracheostomy placement, and breast cancer. She was admitted with leukocytosis most likely related to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and acute renal failure.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has failed pressure support wean. Her urine output has improved from 20-30cc/hr. The urine culture grew Klebsiella, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient received a dose of ceftriaxone on 04/18/2017 at 08:15 PM.

Her electrolyte levels are as follows:
- Sodium: 140 mg/dL
- Potassium: 3.5 mEq/L
- Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 2.7 mg/dL

Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell (WBC) count of 28.4 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 26.3%, and platelet (Plt) count of 150 thousand/mm3.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 47 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 260 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff infection: The patient was found to be positive for C. diff and is currently being treated with IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin for a 14-day course. It is important to monitor for any worsening of symptoms and follow-up with blood and urine cultures.
2. Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture grew Klebsiella, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. She should continue receiving ceftriaxone as prescribed.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient may have hypercarbic respiratory failure due to mental status changes, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. Pressure support should be continued, and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) should be attempted when tolerated.
4. Acute mental status changes (AMS): The patient's mental status is improving but it is unclear what her baseline mental status is. She is more responsive to family than physicians, making it difficult to assess her mental status accurately. Monitoring is recommended.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are decreasing, indicating improvement in renal function. Urine output has also improved. However, there is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal recommendations should be followed up.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were previously elevated but have resolved with free water boluses via orogastric tube. Daily monitoring is recommended.
7. History of breast cancer: The patient's use of aromatase inhibitor (arimidex) should be held while she is on mechanical ventilation and not taking oral medications.
8. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient was only on insulin sliding scale before admission. Humalog sliding scale should be continued, and consideration should be given to starting insulin gtt if blood sugar is not well controlled.
9. GERD: The patient's GERD is stable, and she should continue taking proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipid"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with obesity and a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who has undergone a tracheostomy for treatment. She was admitted previously for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and was treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has been dependent on pressure support ventilation (PSV) since admission and has worsening renal function.

The patient's current assessment includes several conditions:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has a history of OSA but has the chronic capacity to ventilate independently at baseline. She is tolerating PSV well and will be moved to tracheostomy. Initially, she was primarily hypercarbic failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, likely due to the treatment of underlying infection and possible hypovolemia.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is no further information provided regarding the specific location or severity of the skin integrity impairment.
4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension.
5. C. difficile Infection (C diff colitis, Clostridium difficile): The patient has been treated for C. diff infection previously and currently has an ongoing infection.
6. Renal Failure, Acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's renal function is deteriorating,"

   5. Acute Renal Failure:  Improving, Cr trendign downward.  Urine
   negative for casts, will need to follow up final nephrology read.
   Patient has been urinating 15-30cc/hr.  Concern for ATN.
   - f/u Renal recommendations
   5. Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water boluses via OG tube.
   - monitor daily
   6. H/o Breast Cancer: Holding arimidex given pt now on vent and not
   taking POs
   7. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  Patient has a history of T2DM and was only
   on insulin sliding scale.
   - continue humalog sliding scale
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI
   9. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - continue simvastatin
   10. Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in A-Fib. She was recently restarted
   on coumadin after her recent admission for GI bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, breast cancer, and tracheostomy placement. She was admitted with leukocytosis, most likely related to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and acute renal failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status (AMS), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff infection: The patient is already being treated with IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin for a 14-day course. It is important to monitor for any worsening symptoms or signs of infection.
2. Klebsiella UTI: The patient is sensitive to ceftriaxone, so the treatment plan includes a 7-day course of CTX. Regular urine cultures should be done to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This could be secondary to mental status changes or obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Continuing pressure support and conducting a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today is recommended.
4. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's mental status is improving, but it is difficult to assess her baseline due to responsiveness differences towards family and physicians. Monitoring and"

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with chronic tracheostomy admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and acute renal failure. The patient has had persistent compromise in effective ventilation and has shown excellent tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV) support overnight with stabilization of PaCO2 at 15/5.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure - Acute and Chronic: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to chronic tracheostomy and acute respiratory failure. The patient will continue nocturnal ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Long-term settings for ventilation support will be determined.

2. C. Diff Colitis: The patient is being treated for C. diff colitis with oral vancomycin. Improvement in white blood cell count indicates a positive response to treatment.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal in origin. With adequate control of colitis and effective volume support, the patient's creatinine levels have improved towards baseline. Continued monitoring of input/output (I/O) will be maintained.

Other potential complications mentioned in the note include impaired skin integrity, hypotension (not shock), and C. difficile infection. The patient's condition will be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions will be implemented to address these complications and improve her overall health status."
