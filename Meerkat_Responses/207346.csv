","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely trigger for his condition is inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Measures should be taken to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and ensuring proper hand hygiene.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis measures, such as pneumatic boots, should be implemented to prevent DVT formation.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis should be initiated to prevent gastric ulcers.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which indicates a coagulopathy. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate reversal with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K should be considered. Reinitiation of anticoagulation therapy, such as heparin, should be done cautiously after ensuring adequate reversal of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely trigger for his condition is an inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank. Other possible causes include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the inhalation injury and his underlying lung disease.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a bleeding risk. He is currently being reversed with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.
3. Sedation: The patient requires propofol, versed, and fentanyl to maintain synchrony and oxygenation. The goal is to wean off propofol while increasing versed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to decreased preload caused by applied PEEP via mechanical ventilation. He has been on dopamine and now levophed for improved ionotropy.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, with a total input of 7,441 mL and output of 2,900 mL. His urine output is adequate at 2,900 mL.

Plan:
- Continue aggressive albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
- Maintain oxygenation and ventilation on APR"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: the patient had been
   hypoxic for some time; likely it was his profound hypercarbia that
   precipitated failure. The most likely trigger for his demise is
   inhalation injury from the exploding oxygen tank, which would support
   the appearance of his sputum which seems to be less frank hemoptysis
   and more pink tinged, more suggestive of the presence of hyaline
   membrane formation in the setting of [**Doctor Last Name 2**]. Other possibilities on the
   differential include CAP, but WBC wnl and no history of fevers or
   precipitating illness. Areas of ground glass on CT are suggestive more
   of blood rather than consolidative process. Likely there is a COPD
   exacerbation precipitated by inhalation injury resulting in cough which
   could easily bleed, made worse by his extreme coagulopathy. Concerning
   with this patient is his bullous emphysema, his history of spontaneous
   PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall mass, is the ability to
   ventilate adequately with accurate knowledge of transpulmonary pressure
   and alveolar pressure.
   -oxygenating and ventilating well on APRV.  Have decreased FIO2
   requirements to 0.5
   - if oxygenating well but remaining hypercarbic, can increase T-low.
   Attempt ARDsnet ventilation given suspicion for [**Doctor Last Name 2**] (PaO2/FiO2 ratio is
   143 in ARDS range at this time).
   - esophageal balloon to titrate peep effectively
   -continue deep suction
   -methylprednisolone 60 IV Q6h
   -aggressive albuterol and ipratropium MDI's
   -will cover for now empirically for CAP, however, low suspicion, with
   CTX, azithro and vanco. Holding on levoflox for double coverage given
   very high INR.
   -hold coumadin, reverse with ffp and vitamin K 10 IV x 1.
   -aline, CVL in place
   .
   # Sedation  - patient requiring propofol at 90, versed at 12 and
   fentanyl at 200 to maintain synchrony and oxygenation. Would like to
   come down off propofol, while going up preferentially on versed.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Currently the hypotension is in the setting
   of decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation. Was on
   dopamine via peripheral access. Now to levophed for improved ionotropy
   with attempt to wean overnight.
   .
   # Coagulopathy - unclear why INR is so high on admission; it could be
   that patient is not taking his medication correctly. Currently
   reversed. Caution with restarting coumadin - if still in ICU, should
   restart heparin gtt.
   -monitor coags
   -active type and screen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely trigger for his condition is an inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank. The patient's sputum appears to be pink tinged, suggesting hyaline membrane formation due to [Doctor Last Name 2]. Other possible causes include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is hypoxic and hypercarbic, likely due to the inhalation injury. He is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on airway pressure release ventilation (APRV). FiO2 requirements have been decreased to 0.5, and T-low can be increased if oxygenation is good but carbon dioxide elimination is inadequate.
2. Sedation: The patient requires propofol at 90, versed at 12, and fentanyl at 200 to maintain synchrony and oxygenation. It is planned to decrease propofol while increasing versed as needed.
3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, possibly due to decreased preload caused by applied PEEP via mechanical ventilation. Dopamine was initially used for peripheral access, and now levophed is being used for improved inotropy. An attempt will"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: the patient had been
   hypoxic for some time; likely it was his profound hypercarbia that
   precipitated failure. The most likely trigger for his demise is
   inhalation injury from the exploding oxygen tank, which would support
   the appearance of his sputum which seems to be less frank hemoptysis
   and more pink tinged, more suggestive of the presence of hyaline
   membrane formation in the setting of [**Doctor Last Name 2**]. Other possibilities on the
   differential include CAP, but WBC wnl and no history of fevers or
   precipitating illness. Areas of ground glass on CT are suggestive more
   of blood rather than consolidative process. Likely there is a COPD
   exacerbation precipitated by inhalation injury resulting in cough which
   could easily bleed, made worse by his extreme coagulopathy. Concerning
   with this patient is his bullous emphysema, his history of spontaneous
   PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall mass, is the ability to
   ventilate adequately with accurate knowledge of transpulmonary pressure
   and alveolar pressure.
   -oxygenating and ventilating well on APRV.  Have decreased FIO2
   requirements to 0.5
   - will drop T low in an attempt to begin weaning off of ventilator.

   -will d/c abx
   -hold coumadin, reverse with ffp and vitamin K 10 IV x 1.
   -aline, CVL in place
   .
   # Sedation  - patient requiring propofol at 90, versed at 12 and
   fentanyl at 200 to maintain synchrony and oxygenation. Would like to
   come down off propofol, while going up preferentially on versed.
   Continue to wean sedation.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Currently the hypotension is in the setting
   of decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation. Was on
   dopamine via peripheral access. Then to levophed for improved ionotropy
   with attempt to wean overnight.  Pt is now off levophed.
   .
   # Coagulopathy - unclear why INR is so high on admission; it could be
   that patient is not taking his medication correctly. Currently
   reversed. Caution with restarting coumadin.
   -restart anticoagulation - will give pt heparin IV
   -monitor coags

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely trigger for his respiratory failure is an inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank. Other possibilities include COPD exacerbation or pneumonia, but these are less likely given the patient's presentation and test results.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 96/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 50% FiO2. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, pCO2 of 54 mmHg, pO2 of 123 mmHg, HCO3 of 36 mEq/L, and base excess of 9 mEq/L.

The patient has a history of severe COPD, bullous emphysema, spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass. His current medications include dopamine, levophed, midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, methylprednisolone, albuterol, ipratropium, and heparin.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: the patient had been
   hypoxic for some time; likely it was his profound hypercarbia that
   precipitated failure. The most likely trigger for his demise is
   inhalation injury from the exploding oxygen tank, which would support
   the appearance of his sputum which seems to be less frank hemoptysis
   and more pink tinged, more suggestive of the presence of hyaline
   membrane formation in the setting of [**Doctor Last Name 2**]. Other possibilities on the
   differential include CAP, but WBC wnl and no history of fevers or
   precipitating illness. Areas of ground glass on CT are suggestive more
   of blood rather than consolidative process. Likely there is a COPD
   exacerbation precipitated by inhalation injury resulting in cough which
   could easily bleed, made worse by his extreme coagulopathy. Concerning
   with this patient is his bullous emphysema, his history of spontaneous
   PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall mass, is the ability to
   ventilate adequately with accurate knowledge of transpulmonary pressure
   and alveolar pressure.
   -oxygenating and ventilating well on APRV.  Have decreased FIO2

   .
   # Sedation - patient requiring propofol at 40, versed at 12 and
   fentanyl at 200 to maintain synchrony and oxygenation. Would like to
   come down off propofol, while going up preferentially on versed.
   Continue to wean sedation.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Currently the hypotension is in the setting
   of decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation. Was on
   dopamine via peripheral access. Then to levophed for improved ionotropy
   with attempt to wean overnight.  Pt is now off levophed with MAP > 60.
   # Hypernatremia
 will start free water 250 mg q 4 hours

   # Coagulopathy - unclear why INR is so high on admission; it could be
   that patient is not taking his medication correctly. Currently

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely trigger for his respiratory failure is an inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank. Other possibilities include COPD exacerbation or pneumonia, but these are less likely. The patient's bullous emphysema, history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass make ventilating adequately a concern.

The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and started on dopamine for hypotension. He required high doses of propofol for sedation to maintain adequate oxygenation. He transitioned from dopamine to levophed and received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for an elevated INR. The viral DFA was negative. He is currently on midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol, but off levo. His mean arterial pressure (MAP) is in the low 60s. The team is trying to wean propofol and accept higher midazolam/fentanyl as needed. His oxygenation and ventilation have improved on airway pressure release ventilation (APRV).

The patient has a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has bullous emphysema, a history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   1.       Profound Hypoxemic Resp Failure: DDx is broad with primary
   COPD exacerbation in setting on inhalational injury, pulmonary
   hemorrhage in setting of hypercoag state, PNA, PE excluded with PE.
   Presently on AC but with persistent profound hypercarbia- we have
   maximally will try to increase PEEP, place eso. balloon
 may try APRV.
   Has hx of spontaneous PTX with blebs in past so careful with
   overdistension.
   Will Rx with MDI and high dose steroids,
   Will cover for severe CAP- Vanco, CTX, Azithro
   Droplet precautions
 check DFA
   2.       Hypotension: DDx very low pre load given high PEEPS, massive
   sedation or evolving early sepsis. Check CVP on new CVL- though he has
   likely pHTN
   3.       Sedation: Pt requires massive sedation to maintain passive
   ventilation. Currently on very high dose propafol and transitioning
   over to versed and fentanyl.
   4.       Free Water deficit: start free water bolus
   5.       antiCoag: for DVT- reversed yesterday
 start heparin

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is respiratory distress, and the patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs indicate hypothermia, hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels, including low potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels. The patient also has elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate acid levels.

The patient's condition is complicated by profound hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may be due to COPD exacerbation, inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, possibly due to low preload, massive sedation, or evolving early sepsis. The patient requires massive sedation to maintain passive ventilation and is currently on high doses of propofol and transitioning to versed and fentanyl.

Other issues include free water deficit, coagulopathy (previously had deep vein thrombosis), altered mental status, and hypothermia. The patient is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stress ulcers.

In summary, the potential medical complications for this patient include respiratory failure, hypotension, coagulopathy, altered mental status, hypothermia, free water deficit, and stress ulcers."

   respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: the patient had been
   hypoxic for some time; likely it was his profound hypercarbia that
   precipitated failure. The most likely trigger for his demise is
   inhalation injury from the exploding oxygen tank, which would support
   the appearance of his sputum which seems to be less frank hemoptysis
   and more pink tinged, more suggestive of the presence of hyaline
   membrane formation in the setting of [**Doctor Last Name 2**]. Other possibilities on the
   differential include CAP, but WBC wnl and no history of fevers or
   precipitating illness. Areas of ground glass on CT are suggestive more
   of blood rather than consolidative process. Likely there is a COPD
   exacerbation precipitated by inhalation injury resulting in cough which
   could easily bleed, made worse by his extreme coagulopathy. Concerning
   with this patient is his bullous emphysema, his history of spontaneous
   PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall mass, is the ability to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely trigger for his condition is an inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank. The patient's sputum appears to be less frank hemoptysis and more pink tinged, suggesting the presence of hyaline membrane formation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of his severe lung disease and inhalation injury. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's bullous emphysema, history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass increase the risk of COPD exacerbation. This can result in worsening cough and increased difficulty in breathing.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a potential coagulation disorder. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia when lying flat, which may be related to temperature/hypothermia or other underlying conditions.
5. Hypotension: The patient had episodes of hypotension, particularly in the setting of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation. This can lead to decreased tissue perf"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient had been hypoxic for some time and likely experienced a respiratory collapse due to inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank. This injury may have caused hyaline membrane formation and led to his respiratory failure.

The patient also has a history of spontaneous pneumothorax, bullous emphysema, and large abdominal and chest wall mass, which makes ventilating him adequately a concern. His ability to ventilate effectively is crucial in determining his prognosis.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate in the 50s, blood pressure around 114/65 mmHg, respiratory rate in the 20s, and oxygen saturation in the high 90s when sitting up. His temperature is normal.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose, and an increased INR. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with APRV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and sedated with versed and fentanyl. His peep settings are being titrated using an esophageal balloon. He is also receiving methylprednisolone, albuterol, ipratropium, and deep suctioning."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely trigger for his respiratory failure is an inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank. Other possible causes include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately ventilated or if there are further complications such as pneumonia or COPD exacerbation.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a coagulation disorder. This increases the risk of bleeding or clot formation.
3. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia when lying flat, which could be related to temperature/hypothermia or other underlying conditions.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, requiring dopamine and norepinephrine infusions for hemodynamic support. This may indicate poor cardiac output or fluid responsiveness.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which need to be corrected with free water administration.
6. Esophageal Balloon Malposition: There is concern about the proper positioning of the esophageal balloon used to titrate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) effectively.
7. Infection: The patient may be"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease who presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely trigger for his respiratory failure is an inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank, which is supported by the appearance of his sputum. Other possible causes include COPD exacerbation precipitated by inhalation injury.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, bradycardia, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, hypotension, altered mental status, and altered electrolytes.

The patient is currently being treated with mechanical ventilation using APRV mode, with decreased FiO2 requirements to 0.5. He is also receiving medications such as methylprednisolone, albuterol, ipratropium, propofol, versed, and fentanyl to maintain synchrony and oxygenation.

The patient's sedation is being weaned off, and efforts are being made to decrease the use of propofol while increasing the use of versed. The patient is also off levophed with a MAP > 60, and his coagulopathy is being reversed with FFP and vitamin K.

The patient's hypernatremia is being addressed by starting free water administration. The patient's coagulation status will be monitored, and anticoagulation with heparin will be restarted with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-inch-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation with APRV mode. There are multiple medical complications that have been identified:

1. Profound Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe respiratory failure, with a possible differential diagnosis including COPD exacerbation, inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumonia (PNA), and others. The patient is responding well to current ventilation settings but may require higher tidal volumes if necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low preload possibly due to high PEEP levels, massive sedation, or evolving early sepsis. The patient has been on off Levoiphed and is being weaned off it today.

3. Sedation: The patient requires massive sedation to maintain passive ventilation. Currently, the patient is off propofol and transitioning to versed and fentanyl.

4. Free Water Deficit: The patient has a free water deficit, and a free water bolus should be started.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation problem, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Heparin should be started for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated"

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/67 mmHg to 138/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,043 mL and output of 2,807 mL over the past 24 hours.

Respiratory support includes being on APRV mode with a respiratory rate of 2, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 28 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 97%. ABG results show pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 65 mmHg, PaO2 of 102 mmHg, HCO3- of 33 mEq/L, and BE of -6 mEq/L. Ve is set at 14.1 L/min. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 204.

Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Lab results show a WBC count of 7.0 K/uL, Hct of 28.8%, Plt of 181 K/uL, Cr of 0.7 mg/dL, TCO2 of 36-38, Glucose of 117 mg/dL, and other labs within normal range.

Assessment and Plan include respiratory failure, hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and neurological complications.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, which can result in inadequate cardiac output and reduced tissue perfusion.
4. Hypothermia: The patient has a low body temperature, which can increase the risk of complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and organ dysfunction.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: ddx includes
   inhalational injury on top of severe COPD, diffuse pulm hemorrhage [**3-9**]
   elevated INR, and/or pneumonia.  Pna unlikely given normal temp curve
   and normal WBC. Concerning with this patient is his bullous emphysema,
   his history of spontaneous PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall
   mass, is the ability to ventilate adequately with accurate knowledge of
   transpulmonary pressure and alveolar pressure.
   - oxygenating/ventilating well on APRV.
   - off empiric Abx
   - esophageal balloon to titrate peep effectively
   -continue deep suction
   -methylprednisolone 60 IV Q6h to be weaned today
   -aggressive albuterol and ipratropium MDI's
   -a line, CVL in place
   # Sedation - patient off propofol, versed at 13 and fentanyl at 210 to
   maintain synchrony and oxygenation. Continue to wean sedation as
   tolerated.
   # Bradycardia
 seems positional, but no events overnight.
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Currently the hypotension is in the setting
   of decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation vs high
   sedation. Was on dopamine via peripheral access. Then to levophed for
   improved ionotropy with attempt to wean overnight.  Pt is now off
   levophed with MAP > 60.
   # Hypernatremia
 on free water 200 mg q 6 hours.  Can increase free
   water boluses now pt is on TF.
   # Decreased Urine output
 currently making 40 ml/hr UOP on lasix gtt
   at 1.  Will follow closely.
   .
   # Coagulopathy - unclear why INR is so high on admission; it could be
   that patient is not taking his medication correctly. Currently
   reversed. Caution with restarting coumadin.
   -restart anticoagulation
 on heparin IV  without bolus and goal PTT
   60-80, monitor closely
   -monitor coags

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications, including severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, potential inhalational injury, elevated INR, pneumonia, decreased urine output, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and bradycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is a serious condition where the patient's lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen to the body. It can be caused by severe COPD, inhalational injury, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, or pneumonia.

2. Inhalational injury: The patient's history of bullous emphysema, spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass increases the risk of inhalational injury, which can further compromise lung function.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a potential bleeding risk. This needs to be monitored closely, especially with plans to restart anticoagulation.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not managed properly.

5. Decreased urine output: The patient is currently making 40 ml/hr of urine output, which is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes inhalational injury, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, and/or pneumonia. The patient's history of bullous emphysema, spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass make ventilation a concern. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation using APRV mode. Sedation has been restarted due to a drop in oxygen saturation when attempting to wean it down. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate above 70 and blood pressure above 100, with increased urine output. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,996 mL and output of 857 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,139 mL. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient is being treated with aggressive albuterol and ipratropium MDIs, methylprednisolone, and antibiotics. Esophageal balloon is used to titrate PEEP effectively, and deep suction is continued. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and bullous emphysema make him susceptible to respiratory failure. Close"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to inhalational injury, severe COPD, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, pneumonia, or other factors. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Ventilatory support: The patient has bullous emphysema, a history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass, which can make it challenging to ventilate adequately. Accurate knowledge of transpulmonary pressure and alveolar pressure is crucial.
3. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia, which appears to be positional. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, likely related to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) initially in the emergency department, and during mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is necessary.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires careful management with free water administration. Gradual correction of serum sodium levels is important to prevent complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes inhalational injury, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, pneumonia, and bullous emphysema. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition may worsen if oxygenation and ventilation are not maintained adequately.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which could be due to medication non-compliance or other underlying causes. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced bradycardia, which may be positional or related to high levels of sedation.
4. Hypotension: The patient has shown episodes of hypotension, possibly due to decreased preload from applied PEEP during mechanical ventilation or high sedation.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected with careful fluid management.
6. Decreased urine output: The patient's urine output is low, indicating the need for close monitoring and appropriate management.
7. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers are being administered to prevent potential complications.
8. Potential reintubation or extubation complications: The patient's ability to breathe independently after weaning from mechanical ventilation needs to be closely monitored.
9. Pneumonia: Although less likely given normal temperature curve and white blood cell count, the patient is still at risk for developing pneumonia due to being intubated and in the ICU setting."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation in APRV mode with a FiO2 of 40% to maintain oxygenation. The ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 255, which indicates severe hypoxemia. This suggests the patient has acute respiratory failure.

2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The serum sodium level is elevated at 149 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia. This can be due to dehydration or excessive sodium intake.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently below the normal range of 70-100 beats per minute, with a lowest recorded value of 56 bpm. This indicates bradycardia.

4. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is 36.1°C, which is below the normal body temperature range of 36.5-37.5°C. This suggests hypothermia.

5. ICU Care: The patient is receiving various ICU interventions, including mechanical ventilation, arterial and multi-lumen lines, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

6. Lab Results: The complete blood count (CBC) shows leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.1 K/uL. The"

 HYPOTHERMIA
   51 yo M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: the patient had been
   hypoxic for some time; likely it was his profound hypercarbia that
   precipitated failure. The most likely trigger for his demise is
   inhalation injury from the exploding oxygen tank, which would support
   the appearance of his sputum which seems to be less frank hemoptysis
   and more pink tinged, more suggestive of the presence of hyaline
   membrane formation in the setting of [**Doctor Last Name 2**]. Other possibilities on the
   differential include CAP, but WBC wnl and no history of fevers or
   precipitating illness. Areas of ground glass on CT are suggestive more
   of blood rather than consolidative process. Likely there is a COPD
   exacerbation precipitated by inhalation injury resulting in cough which
   could easily bleed, made worse by his extreme coagulopathy. Concerning
   with this patient is his bullous emphysema, his history of spontaneous
   PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall mass, is the ability to
   ventilate adequately with accurate knowledge of transpulmonary pressure
   and alveolar pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient had been hypoxic for some time and likely experienced inhalation injury from an exploding oxygen tank, leading to his respiratory failure. Other possibilities include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation with APRV and has shown improvement in oxygenation requirements.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels and is being corrected with free water administration.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate decreases when lying flat but is currently stable without symptoms.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to decreased preload caused by positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation. He has been on dopamine and levophed for improved ionotropy and is currently weaned off levophed.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is high, indicating a coagulation disorder. This has been reversed, and caution is advised when restarting anticoagulation.
6. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's urine output is low, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring and consideration for diuresis will be done.
7. Sedation: The patient requires massive sedation to maintain passive ventilation. He is currently on versed and fentanyl.
8. Free Water Deficit: The patient has a free water deficit and will receive free water boluses.
9. Anticoagulation: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and will start heparin for anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Profound Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to COPD exacerbation, inhalation injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to low preload, massive sedation, or evolving sepsis. Inotropic support may be required.
3. Sedation: The patient requires massive sedation to maintain passive ventilation. Careful titration and monitoring of sedation levels are essential.
4. Free Water Deficit: The patient has a free water deficit that needs to be corrected to prevent hypernatremia.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation disorder needs to be managed carefully to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's low urine output may indicate ATN. Close monitoring and consideration for diuresis are necessary.

The patient's medical history, current condition, and potential complications indicate the need for careful management and monitoring in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with respiratory failure, hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. He was admitted with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to a primary COPD exacerbation or other causes such as inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumonia, or sepsis. The patient has been sedated and mechanically ventilated but is responding well to APRV mode. 

The patient's hypotension is a concern, and potential causes include low preload, massive sedation, or early sepsis. Levophed has been weaned off, and the CVP remains stable. 

The patient requires further evaluation and management for free water deficit, anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and other remaining issues as per the house staff. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed promptly.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as seizures or neurological damage.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate should be monitored closely, as it may indicate an underlying cardiac condition or medication side effect.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature should be corrected to maintain normal physiological functions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with respiratory failure due to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. The primary cause is suspected to be a COPD exacerbation, possibly complicated by inhalational injury, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation with APRV mode, showing good response. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/62 mmHg to 137/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has edema in the extremities, sedation, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension could be due to low preload, massive sedation, or early sepsis. Monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status closely is essential to detect any further cardiovascular complications.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of hypercoagulability, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Anticoagulation therapy may be required.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch tall adult admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. They have a history of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, they are at an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current renal function is compromised, and further deterioration in renal function could lead to AKI.
5. Sepsis: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of multiple comorbidities and potential infections.
6. Nosocomial infections: The prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.
7. Arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia and pre-existing coronary artery disease make them susceptible to arrhythmias.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and possible inhalational injury on top of severe COPD. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 104/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds and the presence of an endotracheal tube. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal coagulation profile with prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio. The patient's sedation has been adjusted with midazolam and fentanyl, and he is currently off pressors with a maintained mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. The plan includes weaning sedation as tolerated, aggressive albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, methylprednisolone, and close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes. Potential complications include severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, bullous emphysema, spontaneous pneumothorax, and coagulopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Inhalational injury on top of severe COPD: The patient's history of severe obstructive and restrictive lung disease makes him more susceptible to complications from inhalational injury.

2. Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage: The presence of hemoptysis indicates possible diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, which can further compromise the patient's respiratory status.

3. Pneumonia: Despite having a normal temperature curve and white blood cell count, the patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to being intubated and sedated.

4. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch: The patient's bullous emphysema, history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass may lead to difficulties in accurately assessing transpulmonary pressure and alveolar pressure, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

5. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently low, indicating bradycardia. This could be due to various factors, including sedation or an underlying cardiac condition.

6. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which could be related to decreased preload caused by positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation or high levels of"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: ddx includes
   inhalational injury on top of severe COPD, diffuse pulm hemorrhage [**3-9**]
   elevated INR, and/or pneumonia.  Pna unlikely given normal temp curve
   and normal WBC. Concerning with this patient is his bullous emphysema,
   his history of spontaneous PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall
   mass, is the ability to ventilate adequately with accurate knowledge of
   transpulmonary pressure and alveolar pressure.
   - oxygenating/ventilating well on APRV.  Will try to decrease P high to
   25 in an attempt to wean from vent, check ABG.
   - off empiric Abx
   - esophageal balloon to titrate peep effectively
   -continue deep suction
   -methylprednisolone 60 IV Q6h.  Will titrate down in next 24-48 hrs.
   -aggressive albuterol and ipratropium MDI's
   -a line, CVL in place
   # Sedation - patient off propofol, versed at 13 and fentanyl at 210 to
   maintain synchrony and oxygenation. Continue to wean sedation as
   tolerated.
   # Bradycardia
 seems positional, but no events overnight.
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Currently the hypotension is in the setting
   of decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation vs high
   sedation. Was on dopamine via peripheral access. Then to levophed for
   improved ionotropy with attempt to wean overnight.  Pt is now off
   levophed with MAP > 60.
   # Hypernatremia
 on free water 200 mg q 6 hours.  Will inc free water
   boluses to 300 mg q6.
   # Decreased Urine output
 currently making 40 ml/hr UOP on lasix gtt
   at 1.  Will follow closely.
   .
   # Coagulopathy - unclear why INR is so high on admission; it could be
   that patient is not taking his medication correctly. Currently
   reversed. Caution with restarting coumadin.
   -restart anticoagulation
 on heparin IV  without bolus and goal PTT
   60-80, monitor closely
   -monitor coags
   -active type and screen
   # Anemia
 Hb with slight drop from 9.3 to 8.4.  Closely monitor, can
   repeat Hct, guiac all stools.
   # FEN: On TF at 30 ml/hr, replete electrolytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 104/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, and/or pneumonia pose a significant risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-induced lung injury: The patient's bullous emphysema, history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass make it challenging to accurately assess transpulmonary pressure and alveolar pressure during ventilation. This increases the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, which could be positional or related to high sedation levels.
4. Hypotension: The patient has shown episodes of hypotension, which may be due to decreased preload from applied PEEP during mechanical ventilation or high sedation levels.

   #  Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: ddx includes
   inhalational injury on top of severe COPD, diffuse pulm hemorrhage [**3-9**]
   elevated INR, and/or pneumonia.  Pna unlikely given normal temp curve
   and normal WBC. Concerning with this patient is his bullous emphysema,
   his history of spontaneous PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall
   mass, is the ability to ventilate adequately with accurate knowledge of
   transpulmonary pressure and alveolar pressure.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease.
- He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and a history of spontaneous pneumothorax.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 104/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.
- The patient is mechanically ventilated using APRV mode with a set respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O.
- His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal coagulation profile with an INR of 1.4.
- The patient has a history of bullous emphysema, large abdominal and chest wall mass, and previous spontaneous pneumothorax, which increases the risk of ventilatory complications.
- The patient's current medications include furosemide, heparin, midazolam, fentanyl, methylprednisolone, albuterol, ipratropium, and Lasix.
- The patient is being closely monitored for potential complications such as severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, coagulopathy, anemia, hypernatremia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The potential medical complications include inhalational injury on top of severe COPD, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, pneumonia, bullous emphysema, spontaneous pneumothorax, large abdominal and chest wall mass, difficulty ventilating adequately, and hypernatremia.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure may be due to inhalational injury, severe COPD, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, and/or pneumonia. The concern is the patient's bullous emphysema, history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass, which may affect ventilation. The patient is off empiric antibiotics and receiving methylprednisolone, aggressive albuterol and ipratropium MDI's, and sedation with versed and fentanyl. Bradycardia seems positional and stable overnight, hypotension is likely related to applied PEEP, and hypernatremia is being treated with free water. Decreased urine output is being closely monitored, coagulopathy is being reversed, anemia is stable, and anticoagulation is planned with heparin. Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots and heparin for DVT,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes inhalational injury on top of severe COPD, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, and/or pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 112/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with an APV mode, set respiratory rate of 25, tidal volume of 461 mL, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an ABG showing pH 7.35, PaCO2 42 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 260.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 5.9-7.2 thousand/mm3, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 0.7-0.9 mg/dL, and hypernatremia with a sodium level of 146 mEq/L. Coagulopathy is present with an elevated INR of 16.3/49.4/1.4, and the patient is currently on heparin gtt at 150 units/hour with a goal PTT of 60-80 seconds.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral pulses assessed, normal skin, and no neurologic assessment performed. The patient is receiving several medications including furosemide, fentanyl, midazolam, and methylprednisolone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe and requires close monitoring. Potential complications include further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, development of respiratory acidosis, and the need for increased levels of ventilatory support.

2. Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage: The presence of hemoptysis suggests the possibility of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. Complications may include worsening hypoxia, respiratory distress, and potential need for interventions such as bronchoscopy or blood transfusions.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate adjustment of anticoagulant therapy are essential to prevent complications such as bleeding or thrombosis.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium level indicates hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration, increased serum osmolality, and potential neurological complications. Management involves free water administration and careful monitoring of sodium levels.

5. Decreased urine output: The patient's decreased urine output"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and a history of diabetes. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has had multiple blood cultures drawn due to suspected infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/57 to 114/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 1,742 mL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there are any complications with the mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure progresses.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may lead to neurological complications such as seizures or altered mental status if not managed properly.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's low heart rate may result in decreased cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion.
4. Hypothermia: If the patient's core temperature continues to drop, it can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction or even cardiac arrest.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and could potentially progress to shock.

   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: ddx includes
   inhalational injury on top of severe COPD, diffuse pulm hemorrhage [**3-9**]
   elevated INR, and/or pneumonia.  Pna unlikely given normal temp curve
   and normal WBC. Concerning with this patient is his bullous emphysema,
   his history of spontaneous PTX, and large abdominal and chest wall
   mass, is the ability to ventilate adequately with accurate knowledge of
   transpulmonary pressure and alveolar pressure.
   - tried to decrease P high to 25 but had to restart at 27 given the

   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Currently the hypotension is in the setting
   of decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation vs high
   sedation. Was on dopamine via peripheral access. Then to levophed for
   improved ionotropy with attempt to wean overnight.  Pt is now off
   levophed with MAP > 60.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes inhalational injury, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, and/or pneumonia. The patient's bullous emphysema, history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and large abdominal and chest wall mass make it difficult to ventilate adequately. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: This can lead to tissue hypoxia and subsequent organ damage, including brain damage due to hypoxia.
2. Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage: This can cause acute respiratory distress and can be life-threatening.
3. Elevated INR: This indicates a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Pneumonia: This can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of sepsis and multi-organ failure.
5. Inhalational injury: This can cause acute lung injury and contribute to respiratory failure.
6. Large abdominal and chest wall mass: This can compress the lungs and further compromise ventilation.
7. Spontaneous pneumothorax: This can occur due to bullous emphysema and can lead to respiratory distress.
8. Bradycardia: This can be caused by medications or positioning and may indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction.

 pt has had h/o bradycardia when he is moved.
   Overnight, pt
s HR seems to have been stable with lowest Hr at 52.
   - will continue to monitor HR trends.
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Then, the hypotension was in the setting of
   decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation vs high
   sedation.
   - pt has been off of pressors for some time.  MAP ranged 59 to 72
   overnight.
   - continue to monitor BP
s and use pressors to keep MAP > 60.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, presenting with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 112/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and assisted ventilation mode (APRV). The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and slightly elevated potassium levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates an elevated INR. The patient's sedation has been adjusted with midazolam and fentanyl to maintain synchrony and oxygenation. The patient has been weaned off antibiotics but remains on methylprednisolone, albuterol, ipratropium, and Lasix for diuresis. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1.7 liters over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood and urine cultures were sent due to a recent fever. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and adjustments to medications and treatments are being made as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: This condition requires close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues including severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, difficulty weaning off ventilator support, subcutaneous emphysema, bacteremia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypernatremia, decreased urine output, coagulopathy, anemia, and potential pneumomediastinum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination. This can result in further respiratory distress and organ dysfunction.
2. Difficulty weaning off ventilator support: The patient has been unable to be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation, which may indicate a poor prognosis for extubation and increased risk of ventilator-associated complications.
3. Subcutaneous emphysema: The presence of air in the subcutaneous tissue suggests pneumomediastinum, a potentially life-threatening condition where air accumulates in the mediastinum, causing lung collapse and compression of major blood vessels.
4. Bacteremia: The positive blood cultures indicate an infection in the bloodstream, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: ddx includes
   inhalational injury on top of severe COPD, diffuse pulm hemorrhage [**3-9**]
   elevated INR, and/or pneumonia.
   - weaning down pt
s steroid - currently receiving methylprednisolone 60
   IV once daily.  Change to prednisone today.
   - continue with albuterol and ipratropium
   - difficulty weaning pt off of APRV yesterday.  After trying different
   settings, the patient is back on APRV on his original settings.
   - additionally, the pt developed subcutaneous emphysema yesterday
   afternoon
 STAT CXR report said that they findings were concerning for
   pneumomediastinum, also with air tracking up along the great vessels
   will review with team today
   # Alkalemia
   - pt
s serum bicarb continuously rising
 now up to 46
   - possibly due to hyperventilation, but pt
s pCO2 is in the 70
s, so
   that seems unlikely
   # Bacteremia
   - pt did spike a fever on Saturday.  Blood and urine cultures were
   sent.  GPC in clusters in 2 tubes.
   - pt started on vancomycin
   - awaiting further culture results
   # Sedation
 patient off Propofol.  Pt receiving versed at 6 and
   fentanyl at 120 to maintain synchrony and oxygenation.
   - continue to attempt wean sedation while maintaining synchrony and
   oxygenation.
   # Bradycardia
 pt has had h/o bradycardia when he is moved.
   Overnight, pt
s HR seems to have been stable with lowest Hr at 52.
   - will continue to monitor HR trends.
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Then, the hypotension was in the setting of
   decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation vs high
   sedation.
   - pt has been off of pressors for some time.  MAP ranged 59 to 72
   overnight.
   - continue to monitor BP
s and use pressors to keep MAP > 60.
   - hopefully, pt will be able to remain off of pressors
   # Hypernatremia
 currently, 146
   - will continue to trend sodium levels
   - will continue free water 300 mg q 6 hours.
   # Decreased Urine output
   - UOP has been 100-360mL/hr over past 24 hrs.  I/O net negative 1.7 L
   yesterday.
   - pt on Lasix gtt at 7 currently
   - goal I/O is -1 to -1.5 L today
   .
   # Coagulopathy - unclear why INR is so high on admission; it could be
   that patient is not taking his medication correctly. Currently
   reversed. Caution with restarting coumadin.
   - pt currently on heparin gtt at 150.  Goal PTT is 60-80.
   - most recent PTT was 49.4.  Ordered a new set of coag
s for this
   morning and will f/u.  Suspect will need to titrate up heparin gtt
   today.
   - continue to monitor coags
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # FEN: On TF at 85 ml/hr, replete electrolytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was intubated in the emergency department. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with APRV mode and has been experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator. He also developed subcutaneous emphysema, which was concerning for pneumomediastinum. Blood cultures showed growth of GPC in clusters in two bottles, and the patient was started on vancomycin. Other medical complications include bradycardia, hypotension, hypernatremia, decreased urine output, coagulopathy, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and there is a need to address the underlying cause, which could be inhalational injury, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, pneumonia, or a combination of these factors.
2. Alkalemia: The patient's serum bicarb is continuously rising, possibly due to hyperventilation. However, this seems unlikely given the patient's pCO2 levels in the 70s. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the alkalemia.
3. Bacteremia: The patient had a fever on Saturday, and blood and urine cultures were sent. GPC in clusters were found"

   - pt
s HR ranged 57-83 overnight
   - will continue to monitor HR trends.
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Then, the hypotension was in the setting of
   decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation vs high
   sedation.
   - pt still of off pressors, with MAP ranging 61-80
   - continue to monitor BP
s and use pressors to keep MAP > 60.
   - note that pt has not required pressors for some time
   # Hypernatremia

   - current sodium level is 144
   - will continue to trend sodium levels
   # Decreased Urine output
   - Net UOP yesterday was 4.5 L; however, I/O net negative only 141 mL.
   - pt still on Lasix gtt
   - would like I/O to be -1 to -1.5 L today

   # Coagulopathy - unclear why INR is so high on admission; it could be
   that patient is not taking his medication correctly. Currently
   reversed. Caution with restarting coumadin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes inhalational injury on top of severe COPD, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, elevated INR, and/or pneumonia.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and attempts to wean him off have failed. He developed subcutaneous emphysema, and a chest X-ray revealed pneumomediastinum with air tracking up along the great vessels. He also has bacteremia with GPC in clusters in two blood culture bottles, and he has been started on vancomycin.

The patient's sedation has been adjusted to maintain synchrony and oxygenation. He has had a history of bradycardia when moved, and his heart rate has ranged from 57-83 overnight. The patient's blood pressure is stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ranging from 61-80 without the need for pressors. However, he has hypernatremia, decreased urine output, coagulopathy with an elevated INR, anemia, and is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   # Bradycardia
 pt has had h/o bradycardia when he is moved.
   - pt
s HR ranged 57-83 overnight
   - will continue to monitor HR trends.
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Then, the hypotension was in the setting of
   decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation vs high
   sedation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease who presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Severe hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD exacerbation may progress, leading to further respiratory distress and potential ARDS.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for GPC clusters, indicating a bacterial infection in the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated.

3. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has developed subcutaneous emphysema and STAT CXR findings are concerning for pneumomediastinum. This condition involves air leakage into the mediastinum and can potentially lead to more severe complications such as tension pneumomediastinum or pneumopericardium.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, which could be due to medication noncompliance or an underlying bleeding disorder. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia and continues to have a low heart rate range (57-83 bpm). This could be a result of medications or the underlying disease state.

6. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotension, likely due to decreased"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-inch-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has emphysema and has been intubated and placed on assisted ventilation due to the failure to wean from mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 116/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,339 mL and output of 2,023 mL, with a negative balance of 141 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and furosemide. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 76 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 303. Physical examination reveals squamous auricles over the neck and chest, no wheezing, and no pneumothorax but pneumomediastinum on chest X-ray. Laboratory results indicate hypernatremia, leukocytosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver enzymes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of emphysema and has been unresponsive to attempts to wean from mechanical ventilation.
- The patient is currently on APRV (Airway Pressure Release Ventilation) and is receiving blood cultures from arterial lines.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/61 to 118/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg and fluid balance with total intake of 4,339 mL and total output of 4,480 mL.
- Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, APRV mode on the ventilator, tidal volume (Vt) of 477-863 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cmH2O.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hematocrit (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and abnormal electrolyte levels including high sodium (Na+), low potassium (K+), and low magnesium (Mg++).
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates normal pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 303 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg.
- Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to breathe independently could lead to further deterioration of respiratory function, potentially resulting in hypoxemia or respiratory arrest.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The presence of pneumomediastinum may increase the risk of barotrauma and compromise respiratory function.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as internal hemorrhage or bruising.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature increases the risk of complications related to decreased metabolic function, including cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, potentially causing neurological symptoms or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate may indicate reduced cardiac output, increasing the risk of hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-inch tall male with a history of subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on CPAP 5 PS / 8 PEEP with elevated CO2 levels. They have been switched to pressure support with Pinsp of 20, PEEP 5, f 25, Tinsp 0.8, which has resulted in a slight reduction in CO2 levels. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci, with no known drug allergies. The patient is receiving multiple infusions including furosemide, heparin sodium, fentanyl, and midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if the respiratory support is inadequate.
2. Sepsis: The presence of bacteremia and positive blood cultures indicates a potential risk for sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated PTT and low platelet count, suggesting a possible coagulopathy that could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels) which may require careful management to prevent complications such as dehydration or neurological disturbances.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate"

   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   1.       Hypoxic respiratory failure: try to drop pressures due to
   pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax; need to minimize all barotrauma.
   Thoracics following; no acute intervention at this time as there is no
   definitive ptx.  Changed from PSV to PS 10/5.  Will repeat ABG.  Will
   accept hypercarbia as long as PH above 7.2  Likely will need trach in
   long term.  Can taper prednisone today.  Cont MDI
   2.       Pneumomediastinum / pneumothorax
 following clinically, lower
   all pressure settings, serial CXR, Thoracics following.  Will need to
   closely follow for mediastinitis.
   3.       Bacteremia
 spiked overnight, repeat cultures sent, currently
   on vanco.  Micro data from a-line showing gpc in clusters 2/2 bottles.
   Will resite a-line.
   4.       Hypotension: resolved, off pressors and tolerating low dose
   lasix drip
   5.       Coagulopathy
 on heparin with goal PTT 60-80.
   6.       Hypernatremia
 resolved, on free water boluses.
   7.       Anemia
 stable, follow Hct
   8.       FEN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is currently on CPAP mode with an FiO2 of 60%. He has subcutaneous emphysema over his neck and chest, as well as a moderate left pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 92 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 182, and an RSBI deferred due to PEEP > 10.

The patient's laboratory values indicate elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct, and elevated TCO2. The blood cultures are positive for GPCs, with negative results from the arterial line. The micro data from the a-line shows GPC clusters in two bottles, suggesting a possible bacterial infection.

The patient's current medications include furosemide, heparin"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Hypox resp failure: now need to drop pressures due to

   to 25, then 23, and allow PCO2 to rise so long as ph above 7.[**6-6**]
   even be able to get over to PSV if we sedated. Likely will need trach
   but need to get to a place where he can even get trach re SC air and
   exclusing airway spillage

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress:

- The patient has an expanding pneumomediastinum and a pneumothorax (ptx) on CT scan. The thoracic team consulted and suggested against placing a chest tube at this time but mentioned they would be available if the patient's condition worsens and a chest tube is necessary.
- The patient is on CPAP 5 PS / 8 PEEP but had elevated CO2 levels. The ventilator settings were adjusted to pressure support with Pinsp of 20, PEEP 5, f 25, Tinsp 0.8, resulting in a slight reduction in CO2 levels.
- The patient has subcutaneous emphysema progressing and dissecting down the arm and face.
- The patient has positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci (GPCs), which indicates a potential bacterial infection.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient has a sinus rhythm and an elevated central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,920 mL and output of 4"

   # Bacteremia
   - pt did spike a fever on Saturday.  Blood and urine cultures were
   sent.  GPC in clusters in 2 tubes.
   - pt started on vancomycin
   - awaiting further culture results
   - will repeat blood cultures
   # Sedation
 patient off Propofol.  Pt receiving versed at 4 and
   fentanyl at 80 to maintain synchrony and oxygenation.
   - continue to attempt wean sedation while maintaining synchrony and
   oxygenation.
   # Bradycardia
 pt has had h/o bradycardia when he is moved.
   - pt
s HR ranged 57-83 overnight
   - will continue to monitor HR trends.
   # Hypotension - likely in the setting of peep initially in the ED with
   BiPap, and peri-intubation. Then, the hypotension was in the setting of
   decreased preload of applied peep via mechanical ventilation vs high
   sedation.
   - pt still of off pressors, with MAP ranging 61-80
   - continue to monitor BP
s and use pressors to keep MAP > 60.
   - note that pt has not required pressors for some time
   # Hypernatremia

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has developed pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, bacteremia, hypotension, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, and decreased urine output. The patient's current condition is stable, and he is being closely monitored for any potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen levels require close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings to ensure adequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax: The presence of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax increases the risk of further barotrauma and potential complications such as worsening respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax.
3. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures have shown GPCs, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion, potentially leading to organ dysfunction.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR suggests a bleeding risk, which should be closely monitored, especially if anticoagulant therapy is restarted.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with subcutaneous emphysema over the neck and chest. A chest X-ray reveals moderate left pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia may worsen due to pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, which can compromise oxygenation.
2. Pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax: The presence of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax increases the risk of further barotrauma and potential tension pneumothorax.
3. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia needs to be closely monitored and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumomediastinum and possible pneumothorax. There are signs of subcutaneous emphysema progressing and dissecting down the arm and face. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. 

The patient has been placed on various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and vancomycin. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal electrolyte levels such as low potassium and magnesium. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP mode with a pressure support of 20, PEEP of 5, and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of further pneumothorax, progression of subcutaneous"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing an expanding pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, bacteremia, hypotension, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, anemia, and is on mechanical ventilation support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's condition can worsen if oxygenation does not improve.
2. Pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax: Further complications can arise if the pneumothorax progresses or if the pneumomediastinum spreads to other areas.
3. Bacteremia: There is a risk of developing sepsis or other systemic infections if the bacteremia is not effectively treated.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's blood clotting ability may be impaired, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hypotension: If the patient's blood pressure drops significantly, it can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels can result in inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, leading to fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can cause neurological complications if not corrected promptly.

The patient's current condition includes pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, bacteremia, hypotension, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, anemia, and feeds through a tube feeding (TF) at 85 ml/hr.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia may worsen due to the presence of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory support is necessary.
2. Pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax: There is a risk of further development or worsening of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, which can compromise respiratory function. Serial chest X-rays and close monitoring by thoracic consultants are required.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has shown signs of bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed. Continued surveillance and administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may fluctuate, and careful monitoring of hemodynamic status is needed. Adjustments in fluid management and vasopressor support may be necessary.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status should be closely monitored due to the use of he"

The patient is a 74-inch tall individual with a weight of 160 pounds. They were admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, hypernatremia (high sodium), bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension (not shock), altered mental status (not delirium), and coagulopathy. The patient has been receiving various treatments including CPAP, pressure support ventilation, furosemide, heparin sodium, and midazolam. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating a negative balance of 720 mL since 12 AM. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal blood gases. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 91 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 182, and a respiratory system compliance index deferred due to PEEP being greater than 10. The patient's physical examination findings are largely incomplete due to limitations in assessing peripheral"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The patient has respiratory failure, evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of extensive subcutaneous emphysema. The patient also has bacteremia, which is an infection in the bloodstream. Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and potential issues with sodium levels related to a specific doctor mentioned in the note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition suggests acute respiratory failure, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs. This can result in further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status and potentially lead to complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream indicates a systemic infection. If left untreated, bacteremia can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can cause dehydration and neurological complications, including seizures or altered mental status.

4. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient's slow heart rate may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as reduced cardiac output and hypotension.

5. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature can impair various organ functions and may indicate inadequate thermoregulation, possibly due to a systemic response"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The chief complaint is respiratory failure, and the patient also has subcutaneous emphysema. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and pan culture, with a fever recorded at 101.6°F. The CT scan shows extensive subcutaneous emphysema, no tracheal injury, and air in the pleural space. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 106/57mmHg to 172/82mmHg, heart rate between 71-107 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with square aur over the neck and chest. 

Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 8.6 g/dL, leukocyte count at 144 K/uL, sodium level at 110 mg/dL, potassium level at 0.6 mg/dL, creatinine level at 1.3 mg/dL, and blood glucose level at 102 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include bacteremia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension (not in shock), coagulopathy, and altered mental status (not delirium). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, pneumothorax, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and barotrauma due to the high airway pressures. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory status, electrolyte imbalances, and coagulopathy."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. They have respiratory failure, severe scapular emphysema, and bacteremia. The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, altered mental status, and coagulopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require mechanical ventilation support. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient is receiving multiple medications and treatments to manage their conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation support for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - the patient is at risk for blood clots due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Stress ulcers - the patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness and prolonged bed rest.
4. Delirium - the patient has altered mental status, which can progress to delirium in a critical care setting.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - indicated by abnormal kidney function tests.
6. Coagulopathy - the patient has a prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and low international normalized ratio, indicating impaired blood clotting.
7. Sepsis - bacteremia and"

   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   - weaning down pt
s steroids
 patient has been getting prednisone 40
   mg daily for the past 2 days
 wean down to 30 mg tomorrow
   - continue with albuterol and ipratropium
   - pt is on PSV with a PEEP of 5, PS of 10
 will wean to a PS of 8 and
   then get an ABG to see if tolerated
   - bicarb is 49 this morning, which is where it has been running
   - will obtain another ABG and will continue to allow for permissive
   hypercapnia as long as pt
s pH remains stable
   # Subcutaneous Emphysema with Pneumomediastinum
   - thoracics was consulted and reported there was no pneumothordax and
   therefore nothing to drain
   - will follow-up thoracics recommendations for abx prophylaxis
   - continue to closely monitor hemodynamic stability
   # Bacteremia
   - One set of blood cx showed GPC (coag negative) in clusters in 2
   tubes.
   - no other blood cultures have grown anything at this time
 will d/c
   vano and will follow-up further culture results (blood and urine
   cultures)
   - will also resite a-line
   - sputum cx

   - pt
s HR ranged 66-95 overnight
   - will continue to monitor HR trends.
   # Hypotension
 no acute issues
   - pt off of pressors for a while, with MAP ranging 68-96
   - continue to monitor BP
s and use pressors to keep MAP > 60.
   # Hypernatremia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving steroids, albuterol, ipratropium, and prophylactic antibiotics for suspected pneumomediastinum. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 145/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels in his blood. Continued monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Subcutaneous Emphysema with Pneumomediastinum: The patient has subcutaneous emphysema, which is the presence of air in the subcutaneous tissue, and pneumomediastinum, which is the presence of air in the mediastinum. This may require further investigation and treatment, such as antibiotic prophylaxis.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. Additional blood cultures are pending, and the patient's antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has subcutaneous emphysema with pneumomediastinum, bacteremia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypernatremia, decreased urine output, coagulopathy, anemia, and is receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has subcutaneous emphysema with pneumomediastinum, which can lead to further complications such as mediastinitis or tension pneumothorax if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates compromised lung function. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if ventilatory support is inadequate or if underlying lung disease progresses.
3. Bacteremia: The presence of budding yeast and GPC in clusters on sputum culture suggests a bacterial infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, bacteremia can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates a coagulation disorder. Poorly controlled coagulopathy can result in excessive bleeding or clotting complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's low"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 145/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 561 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which indicates inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. The respiratory support provided through mechanical ventilation is crucial in managing this condition. However, the presence of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax may further compromise respiratory function, necessitating careful monitoring and potential intervention.

2. Pneumomediastinum/Pneumothorax: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, which can lead to respiratory distress and failure if not appropriately managed. Serial chest X-rays and close clinical monitoring are necessary to assess the progression of these conditions. Thoracic drainage may be required if there is significant pneum"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a thoracic surgery due to suspected pneumothorax but no clear pneumothorax was found. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 145/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 561 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. Immediate intervention is required to minimize barotrauma.
2. Pneumomediastinum / pneumothorax: The patient's pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax need to be closely monitored with serial chest X-rays. Thoracic surgery may be necessary.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has developed bacteremia, which is indicated by a spike in white blood cell count overnight. Cultures have been sent, and the patient is currently on vancomycin.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and sedated, and there is persistent subcutaneous emphysema. The patient has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has shown some improvement, but still requires assistance with breathing. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has a history of allergies, but no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure. The goal is to wean the patient off the ventilator and monitor for any signs of supraglottic airway obstruction.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has developed pneumomediastinum, which is the presence of air in the mediastinum. This condition needs to be closely monitored, and pressure settings should be reduced. Serial chest X-rays and consultation with a thoracic surgeon may be necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient initially had hypotension but has since resolved and is now tolerating a low-dose lasix drip.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV (continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation). The patient has persistent subcutaneous emphysema. 

The vital signs show a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 mmHg to 145/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.6°C. 

The patient's weight has decreased from 163.3 kg at admission to 150 kg currently. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,343 mL and output of 3,895 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 448 mL. 

The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, PaO2 of 206 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28 mEq/L. The respiratory support settings include a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has persistent subcutaneous emphysema and remains on pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius (99.7%), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 mmHg to 145/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus bradycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,343 mL and output of 3,895 mL, with a positive balance of 448 mL. The patient's weight is currently 150 kg, down from 163.3 kg on admission.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume of 458 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's respiratory system compliance is deferred due to hemodynamic instability.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and sedated, with increased air over the neck and chest. There are no wheezes, but there is mention of ""bases"" in June"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. They have a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and have developed pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 to 100/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with intermittent waking. They have a CVP of 3 mmHg, fluid balance of 448 mL positive, and urine output of 3,870 mL.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 144 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 121 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypernatremia (high sodium), bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension (not in shock), altered mental status, and coagulopathy. The plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation, managing pneumomediastinum, addressing hypotension, and monitoring for fevers.

   respiratory failure.
   1.       Hypoxic respiratory failure: able to wean to PSV 5/5 overnight
   and able to decrease sedation to 3 versed/50 fentanyl.  Will bronch
   this AM and assess possible edema adjacent to airway, possible cuff
   leak, and safety of extubation.  Appreciate thoracics recs and input.
   Goal would be to decrease pos pressure ventilation ASAP to resolve
   pneumomediastinum and [**Month (only) 202**] risk of ptx.  If unable to wean from vent,
   consider trach placement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be good candidate for precedex.  Weaning
   steroids, cont MDI.  Allowing permissive hypercapnia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. He has shown some improvement in his condition, but still requires assistance with breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently weaned down to pressure support (PS) 5 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5. The plan is to assess the possibility of edema adjacent to the airway, possible cuff leak, and safety of extubation. If unable to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy placement may be considered.
2. Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema: The patient has developed pneumomediastinum, which is the presence of air in the mediastinum. This condition needs to be closely monitored with serial chest X-rays. Pressure settings will be lowered to minimize further damage.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, but it has resolved and he is now tolerating a low-dose Lasix drip. The goal is to diuresis well and achieve a negative fluid balance.
4. Fevers: The patient had a fever, which has resolved. The source of infection is still being investigated, including"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments during his stay.

1. The patient has shown improvement in his respiratory status, as he was able to wean to pressure support ventilation (PSV) 5/5 overnight and decrease sedation to 3 mg/hour of versed and 75 mcg/hour of fentanyl. The plan is to bronchoscopically assess possible edema adjacent to the airway, possible cuff leak, and evaluate the safety of extubation. The goal is to decrease positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation as soon as possible to resolve pneumomediastinum and reduce the risk of pneumothorax.

2. The patient has pneumomediastinum/emphysema, which will be followed clinically and with serial chest X-rays. All pressure settings will be lowered, following the recommendations of Thoracic Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 6986]. Antibiotics do not appear to play a role in this severe pneumomediastinum. Vancomycin will be discontinued.

3. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he is off pressors, tolerating a low-dose lasix drip. He is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90s to 102/52mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's recent events include being weaned off some sedation, experiencing discomfort and receiving bolus sedation, having an increase in urine output with the administration of IV Lasix but subsequent drop in blood pressure, and being restarted on the Lasix drip.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and positive cultures, indicating a possible bacterial infection in the bloodstream.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial admission to the ICU was due to acute respiratory failure, and he remains on mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, indicating a potential issue with heart function or medication side effects.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is below normal, which may be due to the ICU environment or underlying medical conditions.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypox respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been stable with improvements seen over the past 24 hours. The patient was weaned off some sedation and is now able to wake up more frequently. 

The patient received a bolus sedation twice during periods of discomfort. There was a significant increase in urine output after administering IV Lasix, but the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 90s. Therefore, the Lasix drip was stopped, and the patient was restarted on a gentler Lasix infusion. 

The patient has not had a bowel movement yet but is passing gas. Thoracic plans to bronchoscopically evaluate the patient today. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 82 bpm with a range of 58-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/52 mmHg to 147/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 13-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and his weight is currently 150 kg with an admission weight of 163.3 kg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch tall, 150 kg male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The arterial line was started on 08/05/2178 at 1:00 PM and stopped at 2:30 PM. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 82 bpm, blood pressure 96/49 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, total intake of 3,635 mL, total output of 5,320 mL, and a fluid balance of -1,685 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 539 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 65. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 82, PaO2 of 170, and a base excess (BE) of -26. The patient's laboratory values include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.3 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 28.6%, platelet (Plt) count of 140 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 101 mg/dL, and sodium level of 140 mEq/L. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypernatremia (high sodium), bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension (not in shock), coagulopathy, altered mental status (not delirium), pneumomediastinum, and possible pneumonia. The patient's current issues include weaning from mechanical ventilation, managing pneumomediastinum, controlling blood pressure, addressing fever, and considering antibiotic therapy. The patient's nutritional status is being evaluated, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being implemented."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and elevated levels of potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema. The treatment plan includes weaning the patient off sedation, assessing possible edema adjacent to the airway, evaluating the safety of extubation, decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation to resolve pneumomediastinum and reduce the risk of pneumothorax, and considering tracheostomy if unable to wean from the ventilator. The patient's condition is being closely monitored with serial chest X-rays, and no role for antibiotics in the severe pneumomediastinum has been identified.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   - on PSV 5/5; sedation: versed at 5 and fentanyl at 75
   - having trouble weaning down pt
s sedation
 whenever his sedation is
   decreased, he becomes Tachypneic
 pt would possibly be a candidate for
   precedex
   - goal is to get patient off of positive pressure ventilation in order
   to decrease risk of worsening his subcutaneous emphysema and
   pneumomediastinum
   - currently on prednisone taper
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - down 3.3 L yesterday
 goal is -2L today
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
   - continue to follow CXR
   - minimize positive pressure if possible
   - Thoracics (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6986**] following)
   # Fevers
   - one set of blood cx positive for coag- staph
 repeat blood cx
   PENDING
   - a-line resited
 tip of previous a-line positive for coag- staph
   - pt febrile to 100.9 with WBC elevation to 12.7
   - nursing reports that pt has had increased secretions as well
   - will cover pt for VAP with vanc/zosyn
 will also send sputum for
   culture
   # Hypotension
   - no acute issues
 off pressors
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
   - on heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80 (Current PTT 56.4)
 need to up

   # Hypernatremia
   - resolved with free water flushes.
   - no acute issues
   # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, lactulose, soap suds enema, and oral naloxone.
   - no bowel movement yet
   - will obtain KUB
   - will also consider methylnaltrexone if pt continues without bowl

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/59 to 125/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's physical examination reveals subcutaneous emphysema across both chest walls, radiating down the arms and up the cheeks. Faint heart sounds were heard over the ventilator, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Clear breath sounds were auscultated anteriorly, and hypoactive bowel sounds were present in the abdomen. Some edema was noted in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 201 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 97 mg/dL, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and magnesium level of 2.6 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   able to wean to PSV 5/5 but sedation up to 5 versed/75 fentanyl.
   Appreciate thoracics recs and input.  Goal would be to decrease pos
   pressure ventilation ASAP to resolve pneumomediastinum and [**Month (only) 202**] risk of
   ptx.  If unable to wean from vent, consider trach placement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   good candidate for precedex.  Weaning steroids, cont MDI.  Allowing
   permissive hypercapnia.  Will see if we can decrease sedation, assess

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was intubated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 90/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on the ventilator.

The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation, but recently became more agitated and dys-synchronous on the ventilator, so the sedation level was increased. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated potassium levels, and other lab values within normal range.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum, hypotension, fevers, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, and constipation. The treatment plan includes weaning the patient off sedation, assessing for cuff leak, and performing a spontaneous breathing trial this weekend. The patient's ICU care includes repletion of fiber, electrolytes, and glycemic control. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic and hypercar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, pneumomediastinum, acute respiratory failure, hypernatremia, bradycardia, hypotension, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has developed pneumomediastinum, which is the presence of air in the mediastinum. This can lead to complications such as pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax if not managed appropriately.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of chronic deep vein thrombosis and ongoing heparin therapy puts him at risk for bleeding complications due to coagulopathy.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, potentially causing neurological symptoms or complications.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate can be a sign of underlying cardiac issues or medication effects, and may require further evaluation and management.
6. Hypotension: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation with versed and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/59 mmHg to 125/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 150 kg, and he is receiving fluids and blood products.

The patient is receiving several medications including heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam (versed), and prednisone. He is also receiving albuterol and ipratroprium for respiratory support, and lasix drip has been considered for adjustment.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and needs to be weaned off sedation for a spontaneous breathing trial. The goal is to get the patient off positive pressure ventilation to decrease the risk of worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. The patient is currently on a prednisone taper, and respiratory support medications are being continued.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV mode with an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate between 82-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/59-125/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient has been receiving sedation with midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl, but the sedation level needs to be weaned to allow for a spontaneous breathing trial. The goal is to remove the patient from positive pressure ventilation to decrease the risk of worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. The patient is also on a prednisone taper, albuterol, and ipratropium.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit, platelet count within normal range, and normal kidney function. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated sodium levels. Other lab results include normal amylase and lipase, as well as normal liver function tests.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on positive pressure ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is a condition where there is inadequate oxygenation of the blood due to impaired gas exchange in the lungs. This can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema: The patient has shown signs of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, where air has leaked into the mediastinum and surrounding tissues. This can cause further lung damage and complications.
3. Fevers and suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's blood cultures have shown positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci, indicating a possible infection. Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a risk of developing HAP.
4. Chronic DVT and anticoagulation: The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on heparin to prevent further clot formation. Monitoring of the patient's PTT levels is important to ensure appropriate anticoagulation.
5. Hypernatremia:"

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which requires ongoing mechanical ventilation support. The goal is to wean him off positive pressure ventilation to reduce the risk of worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. Sedation will be increased to decrease the patient's respiratory rate.
2. Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema: The patient has signs of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Close monitoring of chest X-rays is necessary to assess improvement. Minimizing positive pressure ventilation is recommended.
3. Fevers: The patient has had fevers, and blood cultures have shown"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on heparin therapy. His current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema, fevers, hypotension, hypernatremia, and constipation. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his labs are within normal limits. He is being treated with various medications and interventions to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if he does not respond to the current treatment and weaning off mechanical ventilation becomes difficult.
2. Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema: There is a risk of worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum if positive pressure ventilation continues, which can lead to further complications.
3. Fevers and infection: The presence of fevers and positive cultures for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus suggests a possible infection. If the infection progresses, it may lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Hypotension: If the patient's blood pressure drops significantly, it can lead to inadequate organ perfusion"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been on positive pressure ventilation and sedation due to respiratory failure. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/61 to 124/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has shown improvement in his subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum, as evidenced by a repeat chest X-ray that does not show evidence of free air under the diaphragm. However, he remains at risk for worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum, and efforts are being made to minimize positive pressure ventilation.

The patient has developed fevers, with one set of blood cultures positive for coagulation-negative staphylococci. The tip of the previous arterial line was also positive for the same organism, and the patient is febrile with a WBC elevation. This suggests a possible central line-associated bloodstream infection, and the patient is being covered for ventilator-associated pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's chronic history of deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, fevers, hypotension, history of chronic DVT, hypernatremia, and constipation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation with AC 500 x 20, PEEP 5, and FIO2 40%. Increased sedation has been given to decrease autoPEEP. The goal is to wean off positive pressure ventilation to decrease the risk of worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. The patient may be a candidate for precedex and tracheostomy.

2. Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema: The patient's subcutaneous emphysema has shown improvement on an upright chest X-ray. It is important to minimize positive pressure if possible and continue to follow chest X-rays. Thoracics have been ordered.

3. Fevers: The patient had one set of blood cultures positive for coag- negative staph, which may be transient or contaminant. Sputum cultures show 2+ GPC pairs and clusters, and 2+ GPR. The patient"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 59-year-old male with significant medical history including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital with acute onset of abdominal pain and was found to have a large amount of stool backup in the right colon on abdominal CT scan. The patient was started on IV fluids and antibiotics for suspected bowel ischemia or infarction. Despite medical management, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to the decision for emergent exploratory laparotomy and resection of the necrotic bowel segment. Postoperatively, the patient developed respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also developed a coagulopathy, altered mental status, and constipation. The patient is currently being managed in the ICU with appropriate supportive care measures including fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood product transfusions, and nutritional support. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have persistent respiratory failure and remains sedated on mechanical ventilation. Further diagnostic workup including arterial blood gas analysis and cultures is pending. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and code status has been discussed."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, constipation, pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema, fever, hypotension, history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypernatremia, and potential electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. He is on assisted ventilation with AC 500, PEEP 5, and FiO2 40%. There is an ongoing effort to decrease autoPEEP by increasing sedation. The goal is to wean the patient off positive pressure ventilation to reduce the risk of worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-neg staph, but this is likely transient or a contaminant. He is on heparin gtt for chronic DVT management, and the goal PTT is 60-80 (current PTT is 77). Heparin drip will continue, and the patient will transition to coumadin after determining whether a tracheostomy is needed.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is sedated and responds only to voice commands. The cause of altered mental status is not specified in the progress note.

4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing obstipation and has been given various medications including senna, colase, lactulose, soap suds enema, and methylnaltrexone. A CT scan of the abdomen showed stool backed up to the right colon, and a consultation with the GI department has been requested.

5. Pneumomediastinum/Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. He is being monitored with repeated chest X-rays, and measures are being taken to minimize positive pressure ventilation. Thoracicness has been performed by Dr. [Last Name (Title)].

6. Fever: The patient has had one set of blood cultures positive for coag-neg staph. Repeat blood cultures are being done, and the patient has been started on VAP coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) since day 3. The patient has a low-grade temperature, and the WBC count is stable.

7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he is off pressors.

8. History of Chronic DVT: The patient has a history of chronic DVT and is on heparin g"

   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   - on AC 500 x 20, PEEP 5, FIO2 40%.  Increased sedation to 6 versed and
   100 fentanyl to decrease autoPEEP and air hunger.
   - still with high MVe and likely significant dead space given his MVe
   and ABG (ddx includes consolidation vs. volume overload vs.
   subcutaneous air)
   - of note, when sedation is decreased pt becomes tachypnic and
   generates autoPEEP.  Have not made much progress with increasing
   sedation to [**Month (only) 202**] autoPEEP overnight.
   - goal is to get patient off of positive pressure ventilation to
   decrease risk of worsening his subcutaneous emphysema and
   pneumomediastinum, but pt
s overall pulm status is poor.
   - on prednisone taper
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - I/O

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, fevers, coagulopathy, altered mental status, hypotension, hypernatremia, and constipation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate between 79-116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/60 to 130/77 mmHg, respiratory rate between 22-44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

The patient has diffuse crackles and subcutaneous emphysema over the chest and chest wall, soft and distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, and edema in the distal lower extremities.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 12.7 x 10^3/microliter, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 109 x 10^3/microliter, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose level of 107 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 65 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 178 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 96%.

The patient has been diagnosed with constipation, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, hypotension, hypernatremia, and has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is receiving multiple medications including midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, heparin, lasix, and various antibiotics.

The patient's plan includes continuing with diuresis, monitoring for any signs of worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum, and conducting regular chest X-rays. The patient's current disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   - on AC 500 x 20, PEEP 5, FIO2 40%.  Increased sedation to 6 versed and
   100 fentanyl to decrease autoPEEP and air hunger.
   - still with high MVe and likely significant dead space given his MVe
   and ABG (ddx includes consolidation vs. volume overload vs.
   subcutaneous air)

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on assisted mechanical ventilation (AC) with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 40%. Sedation has been increased to decrease auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (autoPEEP) and air hunger.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 93 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 111/62 mmHg to 135/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but he has a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.3 K/uL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 mg/dL, low hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 31.5% to 32.0%, and normal platelet count (Plt) levels ranging from 225 to 260 K/uL. Other lab values such as blood glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   - on PS 14/5 50%.
   - still with high MVe and likely significant dead space given his MVe
   and
   - When sedation is decreased pt becomes tachypnic and generates
   autoPEEP.
   - goal is to wean patient off of positive pressure ventilation in hopes
   of allowing his lungs to heal and prevent worsening of his subcutaneous
   emphysema and pneumomediastinum, but pt
s overall pulm status is poor.
   - on prednisone taper
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - I/O
 negative 900cc yesterday (possibly due to PO contrast)
   still steady and BP stable; cont with diuresis goal of -1 L today.
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
   - continue to follow CXR
   - Worsening subcutaneous emphysema
   - minimize positive pressure if possible
   - Thoracics (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6986**] following); no new recs at this time
   - Will decrease pts MVe and tolerage elevated PCO2.
   - Pending family meeting may opt to paralyze patient and decrease PIP
   and Volumes to attempt to allow lungs to heal
   # Fevers
   - one set of blood cx positive for coag- staph
 repeat blood cx NGTD
   - a-line resited
 tip of previous a-line positive for coag- staph
   (likely trangient or contaminant)
   - sputum cx
 2+ GPC in pairs and clusters; 2+ GPR
   - pt was started on VAP coverage with vanc/zosyn (day 3 today) given
   pulm infiltrates, low grade temps, WBC.
   - pt with low grade temp (Tm 99.4) and WBC stable
   - continue abx for total of 7 days and continue to monitor
   # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, lactulose, soap suds enema, methylnaltrexone.  Will
   [**Month (only) 202**] TF rate to 30 ml/hr.
   - KUB showed stool backed up to the R colon; f/u CT scan shows no
   additional abd pathology
   - will consult GI after discussing goals of care with family as we have
   exhausted our capabilities and are concerned for obstipation
   - added golytely
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
   - on heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80 (Current PTT 77)
 at goal
   - switch to lovenox to decerase total intake (150 mg [**Hospital1 **])
   # Hypotension
 (Resolved)
   - no acute issues
 off pressors
   # Hypernatremia
   - resolved with free water flushes.
   - no acute issues
   # FEN: Tube feeds held given high residual.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Holding tube feeds [**3-9**] high residuals.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on positive pressure ventilation and is being treated for pneumonia, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, fevers, and constipation. He also has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving heparin therapy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 111/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 50% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to underlying lung disease and the need for positive pressure ventilation.
2. Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema: There is a risk of worsening subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum if positive pressure ventilation continues or if there is an infection.
3. Fevers and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with coagulation-negative staphylococci bacteremia, which may indicate VAP. Continued monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
4. Constipation: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   - on PCV+Assist 14/5 50%.
   - CXR essentially unchanged
   - When sedation is decreased pt becomes tachypnic and generates
   autoPEEP.
   - goal is to wean patient off of positive pressure ventilation
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - I/O
 patient was negative 1.2L yesterday
 pt also has a Cr bump
   (now up to 1.1)
 Lasix gtt off right now; consider slowing down on
   diuresis today (Goal of negative 500mL to 1L tomorrow)
   - will decrease pt
s respiratory rate to 24 breaths per minute
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis
   - one set of blood cx positive for coag- staph
 blood cultures
   negative since
   - a-line resited
 tip of previous a-line positive for coag- staph
   - sputum cx
 yeast, GPC in pairs and clusters, GPR
   - urine cx negative
   - pt was started on VAP coverage with vanc/zosyn (day 5 today)
 will
   complete a 7 day course
   - afebrile overnight (Tmax 99.9); WBC at 10.7
   - continue abx for total of 7 days and continue to monitor
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
   - continue to follow CXR
 essentially unchanged today
   - minimize positive pressure if possible
   - thoracics (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6986**] following); questioned possibility of lung
   transplant; however, pt would not be a suitable candidate secondary to
   lack of mobility, active infection, and mental retardation
   - pt currently paralyzed in an attempt to allow lungs to heal
   # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, lactulose, soap suds enema, methylnaltrexone.
   - KUB showed stool backed up to the R colon; f/u CT scan shows no
   additional abd pathology
   - GI recommends checking TSH, getting a gastrograffin enema, and
   following serial KUB
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
   - switched to lovenox yesterday
   # Hypotension
   - pt did have some episodes on hypotension overnight
   - normotensive now
 continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia
   - resolved with free water flushes.
   - no acute issues
   # FEN
 Currently holding tube feeds secondary to high residuals

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 88/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and on ventilator support.

The patient has subcutaneous emphysema present across the chest, down both arms, up to the cheeks, and into the upper abdomen. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated on cardiac examination. The abdomen is described as slightly tighter than previously, with bowel sounds present. Extremities show palpable radial and dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's blood cultures are positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci, while sputum cultures show yeast, gram-positive cocci in pairs, and gram-positive rods. Urine culture is negative.

The patient has several medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema, constipation, history of chronic deep vein thromb"

   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   - on PCV+Assist 14/5 50%.
   - CXR essentially unchanged
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - I/O
 patient was negative 1.2L yesterday, goal of 1L negative for
   today given Cr. bump that occurred yesterday.
   - Pt is paralyzed with cisatricurium in hopes of decreasing PIPs and
   allowing the lung to heal.
   -Goal paralysis TOF [**3-11**]
   -Will tolerate ph to 7.15 and pCO2 of 120
s with goal of lowest airway
   pressure possible while maintaining oxygenation.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis
   - sputum cx
 yeast, GPC in pairs and clusters, GPR
   - pt was started on VAP coverage with vanc/zosyn (day 6 today)
 will
   complete a 7 day course
   - afebrile overnight; WBC at 10.7
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
   - continue to follow CXR
 essentially unchanged today
   - minimize positive pressure if possible
   - pt currently paralyzed in an attempt to allow lungs to heal
   - Plan to keep paralyzed through tomorrow.
   # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, lactulose, soap suds enema, methylnaltrexone.
   - KUB showed stool backed up to the R colon; f/u CT scan shows no
   additional abd pathology
   - GI recommended checking TSH which was 0.25.  Constipation more likely
   in setting of hypothyroidism, while hyperthyroidism generates increased
   freq of bowel movements.
   - GI following
   #Hyperthyroid
   - TSH was 0.25
   - Need to check free T4 as this may be subclinical hyperthyroidism, and
   this will also help guide further evaluation and management.
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
   - switched to lovenox
   # Hypotension
   - pt did have some episodes on hypotension overnight

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, and is being treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition includes hypotension, hypernatremia, constipation, and a history of chronic DVT. He is also on several medications including fentanyl, cisatracurium, and midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumomediastinum/Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient has subcutaneous emphysema present across the chest, down both arms, up to the cheeks to eye level, and into the upper abdomen. This indicates air leakage from the lungs into the surrounding tissues, which can lead to further complications such as pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is suspected to have VAP, and appropriate antibiotic coverage has been initiated. If not managed properly, VAP can progress to severe infection and sepsis.

3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is low, indicating possible subclinical hyperthyroidism. If left untreated"

   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - I/O
 patient was negative 1.2L yesterday, goal of 1L negative for
   today given Cr. bump that occurred yesterday.
   - Pt is paralyzed with cisatricurium in hopes of decreasing PIPs and
   allowing the lung to heal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 14 mL/kg and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His FiO2 is set at 50%. The patient's blood cultures showed coagulase-negative staphylococci, which were negative since admission. His sputum culture revealed yeast, Gram-positive cocci in pairs, and Gram-positive rods. The patient's urine culture was negative. He was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) coverage, to complete a 7-day course. The patient also has pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, for which he is being closely monitored with chest X-rays. He has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is now on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox). The patient experienced episodes of hypotension overnight but is now normotensive. He also had hypernatremia, which has resolved with free water flushes. The patient's thyroid function tests showed a low TSH level, indicating possible subclinical hyperthyroidism. He is currently holding tube feeds due to high residuals.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 121/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has subcutaneous emphysema present across the chest, down both arms, up to the cheeks, and into the upper abdomen. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is receiving PCV+Assist ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. The goal is to wean the patient off positive pressure ventilation. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers will continue, and the patient's fluid balance will be monitored.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has been on VAP coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for six days. Blood cultures are negative except for coagulase-negative staphylococci from the previous arterial line. Sputum cultures show yeast, gram-positive cocci in pairs, and gram"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and other medical conditions. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. He is on PCV+Assist ventilation with FiO2 at 50%. The goal is to maintain oxygenation while minimizing airway pressure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of chronic DVT and is currently on Lovenox. There is an increased risk of bleeding and clotting disorders.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may not be delirium. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which is being managed with laxatives and enemas. A CT scan shows no additional abdominal pathology.
5. Hyperthyroidism: The patient's TSH level is low, indicating possible subclinical hyperthyroidism. Further evaluation and management are required.
6. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension overnight but is now normotensive. Continuous monitoring is necessary.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which resolved with free water flushes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was intubated. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with PCV+Assist mode, FiO2 50%, PEEP 5 cmH2O, and RR set at 24 breaths per minute. He also received sedation and paralysis with cisatricurium to decrease peak inspiratory pressures and allow lung healing.

The patient has shown signs of respiratory failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema, possible atrial tachycardia, constipation, hyperthyroidism, and a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to severe lung disease, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is compromised, which increases the risk of bleeding or clot formation.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as sedation, hypoxia, or other underlying conditions. This increases the risk of delirium or cognitive impairment.

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, the note mentions several medical conditions and complications that the patient is experiencing.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including piperacillin, vancomycin, fentanyl, midazolam, metoprolol, and enoxaparin. These medications suggest that the patient may have an infection or is at risk for blood clots.

The patient's vital signs indicate low blood pressure (87/49 mmHg) and a heart rate within the normal range (85 bpm). The respiratory rate is controlled at 24 breaths per minute, and the patient's oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient's temperature is within the normal range (36.5°C).

The patient's weight has decreased from 163.3 kg at admission to 148.3 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,091 mL and output of 2,916 mL through IV fluids, with a net balance of 1,251 mL.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of PCV+Assist. The settings include a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 26 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is currently sedated and on a ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with PCV+Assist mode, PEEP of 5, and FiO2 of 50%. It is important to monitor his oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated PT/INR and PTT, indicating a coagulation disorder. This may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status but is not in delirium. It is important to monitor his mental status regularly.
4. Constipation: The patient has constipation and is being treated with various laxatives. It is important to monitor his bowel movements and ensure adequate stool softening.
5. Pneumomediastinum/Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema, which is improving slightly. It is important to continue monitoring his chest X-ray and minimize positive pressure ventilation if possible.

   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   - on PCV+Assist 14/5 50%.
   - CXR essentially unchanged
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - I/O
 patient was positive 1.2L yesterday, goal of 1L negative for
   today.
   - Pt is paralyzed with cisatricurium in hopes of decreasing PIPs and
   allowing the lung to heal.
   -Goal paralysis TOF [**3-11**].  This is achieved by adjusting the
   cisatricurium gtt per protocol as ordered.
   -Will tolerate ph to 7.15 and pCO2 of 120
s with goal of lowest airway
   pressure possible while maintaining oxygenation.
   - Will d/c paralytic this afternoon and monitor status. With goal of
   weaning off vent and extubating.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis
   - sputum cx
 yeast, GPC in pairs and clusters, GPR
   - pt was started on VAP coverage with vanc/zosyn (day 7 today).  Final
   dose today
   - afebrile overnight; WBC at 8.2
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
   - continue to follow CXR
 essentially unchanged today
   - minimize positive pressure if possible
   - pt currently paralyzed in an attempt to allow lungs to heal
   - Plan to keep paralyzed through this afternoon.
   #MAT?/Tachycardia:  Patient was tachycardic last night to 120
s.  Was
   given 5mg IV metoprolol and has been in NSR in the 80
s.  MAT/Atrial
   tachycardia may be precipitated by lung pathology or hyperthyroid (this
   is subclinical and less likely).
   # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, lactulose, soap suds enema, methylnaltrexone.
   - KUB showed stool backed up to the R colon; f/u CT scan shows no
   additional abd pathology
   - GI recommended checking TSH which was 0.25.  Constipation more likely
   in setting of hypothyroidism, while hyperthyroidism generates increased
   freq of bowel movements.
   - GI following
   #Hyperthyroid: Low TSH with normal T4 c/w subclinical hyperthyroid.  No
   treatment indicated.
   - TSH was 0.25
   - Free T4 was 6.5 (WNL).
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
   - switched to lovenox
   # Hypotension
   - pt did have some episodes on hypotension overnight
   - normotensive now
 continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia
   - resolved with free water flushes.
   - no acute issues

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. He has been paralyzed with cisatricurium to decrease peak inspiratory pressures and allow the lung to heal. The goal is to achieve a Train-of-Four (TOF) ratio of 3-11, which is achieved by adjusting the cisatricurium infusion rate per protocol.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, not ARDS, and hypoxic respiratory failure. His chest X-ray is essentially unchanged. He is being given albuterol and ipratropium, and his fluid balance is being closely monitored with a goal of negative 1L output for the day.

The patient also has constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. His white blood cell count is elevated at 11.1 K/uL, and he has leukocytosis. He was previously febrile but is now afebrile. He has been on VAP coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam since day 7.

   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   - on PCV+Assist 14/5 50%.
   - CXR essentially unchanged
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - I/O
 patient was positive 1.2L yesterday, goal of 1L negative for
   today.
   - Pt is paralyzed with cisatricurium in hopes of decreasing PIPs and
   allowing the lung to heal.
   -Goal paralysis TOF [**3-11**].  This is achieved by adjusting the
   cisatricurium gtt per protocol as ordered.
   -Will tolerate ph to 7.15 and pCO2 of 120
s with goal of lowest airway
   pressure possible while maintaining oxygenation.
   - Will d/c paralytic this afternoon and monitor status. With goal of
   weaning off vent and extubating.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis
   - sputum cx
 yeast, GPC in pairs and clusters, GPR
   - pt was started on VAP coverage with vanc/zosyn (day 7 today).  Final
   dose today
   - afebrile overnight; WBC at 8.2
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
   - continue to follow CXR
 essentially unchanged today
   - minimize positive pressure if possible
   - pt currently paralyzed in an attempt to allow lungs to heal
   - Plan to keep paralyzed through this afternoon.
   #MAT?/Tachycardia:  Patient was tachycardic last night to 120
s.  Was
   given 5mg IV metoprolol and has been in NSR in the 80
s.  MAT/Atrial
   tachycardia may be precipitated by lung pathology or hyperthyroid (this
   is subclinical and less likely).
   # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, lactulose, soap suds enema, methylnaltrexone.
   - KUB showed stool backed up to the R colon; f/u CT scan shows no
   additional abd pathology
   - GI recommended checking TSH which was 0.25.  Constipation more likely
   in setting of hypothyroidism, while hyperthyroidism generates increased
   freq of bowel movements.
   - GI following
   #Hyperthyroid: Low TSH with normal T4 c/w subclinical hyperthyroid.  No
   treatment indicated.
   - TSH was 0.25
   - Free T4 was 6.5 (WNL).
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
   - switched to lovenox
   # Hypotension
   - pt did have some episodes on hypotension overnight
   - normotensive now
 continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia
   - resolved with free water flushes.
   - no acute issues

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and peg tube placement yesterday. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His vital signs are within normal limits, but he has subcutaneous emphysema across his chest that has improved compared to previous days. He also has faint heart sounds, harsh breath sounds with ronchi, and slight edema in his feet. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, high blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. His blood glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values, including liver function tests and electrolytes, are within normal limits. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing issues. Firstly, he has respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia but not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His tracheostomy and peg tube placement are planned to improve his ventilation. Secondly, he has fevers and leukocytosis, but his white blood cell count is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was intubated. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving sedation and analgesia. He has undergone tracheostomy and peg tube placement. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 92/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a slight edema in his feet bilaterally. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation. The current plan is to continue assisted ventilation through a tracheostomy tube while weaning sedation down.
2. Pneumomediastinum/Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient shows signs of improved subcutaneous emphysema compared to the previous day. Monitoring of chest X-rays and minimizing positive pressure ventilation will be continued.
3. Constipation/Obsipation: The patient is being treated with laxatives and stool softeners to manage constipation.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated PT and PTT, indicating a coagulation disorder. Further investigation and management are"

   CRITICAL CARE:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 6949**] has continued problems with constipation ( since ICU admit)
   and has not stooled for over a week. He remains stable s/p recent
   trach/peg. Sedation is being weaned and we will transition to PSV/CPAP
   but keep PEEP no higher than [**6-12**] ( barotrauma). He will need golytely
   prep today and we ill hold off on Tube feeds till he has started to
   have BM. Possible use of neostigmine if still refractory to golytley
   prep. TPN a consideration if tube feed residuals are high.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement yesterday. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His blood pressure is 92/54 mmHg, heart rate is 81 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient has subcutaneous emphysema across the chest but improved across the abdomen and face. He has faint heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Physical examination also reveals harsh breath sounds, slight edema in the feet bilaterally, and obesity. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high potassium level, and altered liver function tests. The patient's condition is stable, but he has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, constipation, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and potential pneumomediastinum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. His chest X-ray shows subcutaneous emphysema, but it has improved compared to previous days. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate between 80-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been receiving various medications including sedatives, pain relievers, antibiotics, and medications for constipation and hyperthyroidism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and current respiratory failure pose a risk for further deterioration in respiratory function. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema: The presence of subcutaneous emphysema suggests the possibility of pneumomediastinum, which can lead to tension pneumothorax if not managed appropriately.
3. Constipation: The patient is at risk of constipation due to immobilization and certain medications. Regular bowel care is recommended"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe sepsis, ARDS, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. The patient was admitted to the ICU on 07/28/2178 and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

The patient's vital signs are currently stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 89/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the ventilator.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,205 mL, with an output of 1,560 mL through IV fluids and 860 mL through urine. The patient's weight has decreased from 163.3 kg at admission to 144.7 kg currently.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 258, and respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, skin examination is not performed, and neurologic examination is also not conducted.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 144 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) at 6.9 g/dL, blood glucose at 98 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) at 135 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 4.2 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) at 0.6 mg/dL, total bilirubin (T. Bilib.) at 1.4 mg/dL, and lactate at 2.9 mmol/L. The patient's platelet count (Plt) is within normal range at 185 K/uL.

The patient's medical conditions include constipation, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and previous diagnosis of severe sepsis. The patient is on various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, enoxaparin, and others.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and further deterioration of the patient's respiratory and renal function. Regular monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent these complications and optimize the patient's clinical outcome."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Despite this, his white blood cell count remains within normal limits and he is no longer febrile.

The patient has developed pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, which is being monitored through chest X-rays. Efforts are being made to minimize positive pressure ventilation.

The patient's other conditions include possible chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), constipation, subclinical hyperthyroidism, and hypernatremia. His blood pressure is low, and he is receiving IV fluids to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

The patient's mental status is altered, but it is not due to delirium. His sedation will be weaned gradually. The patient is also receiving TPN for nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is already present, and there is a risk of further deterioration if ventilator settings are not optimized or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) recurrence.
2. Pneumomediastinum"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with symptoms of hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/51 to 76/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His current weight is 144.7 kg, and his height is 74 inches. 

Fluid balance reveals a total intake of 1387 mL, including 385 mL by mouth, 152 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF), and 1180 mL of intravenous fluids. The total output includes 985 mL of urine and 105 mL of stool. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL, sodium level of 149 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, glucose level of 109 mg/dL, and a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, coagulopathy, constipation, and hypernatremia. The plan includes weaning off sedation and ventilatory support, continuing antibiotic treatment, monitoring for signs of clinical deterioration, minimizing positive pressure, restarting low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and managing constipation. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. 

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is sedated with fentanyl and midazolam, which may contribute to his altered mental status. Gradual weaning off these medications will be important to assess his mental status and prevent further complications such as delirium or worsening sedation.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis. However, his anticoagulant therapy was temporarily held due to a procedure,"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 100.8°F, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 97/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals crepitus in the chest, warm extremities without edema, and an unarousable mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. The blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT/INR and elevated PTT. The imaging studies reveal no relevant changes in the chest X-ray compared to the previous one, with bilateral inclusion in the soft tissues and a diffuse reticular lung parenchymal pattern.

The patient has several potential medical complications. These include respiratory failure, altered mental status, constipation, coagulopathy, and hypernatremia. The patient's respiratory failure is due to hypoxia and hypercarbia. His altered mental status may be attributed to multiple factors such as sedation, hypoxia, or sepsis. Constipation is being managed with laxatives. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, and placement of a central venous line. He has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and zosyn. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, enoxaparin, and various other medications for constipation, hyperthyroidism, and chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 97/49 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 87 bpm. His respiratory status is stable with a SpO2 of 100% on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's laboratory results indicate hypernatremia with a sodium level of 149 mEq/L. Chest X-rays show heterogeneous opacification of the lower lungs, which has improved since admission, and subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and neck, which has also improved. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is unarousable to voice or touch.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and peg placement. Currently, he is on mechanical ventilation and sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. The patient has completed a 7-day course of vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but still has a normal white blood cell count and is afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.

2. Infection: Despite completing a course of antibiotics for VAP, the patient's sputum culture results are pending. There is a possibility of ongoing infection, and further evaluation may be required.

3. Pneumomediastinum/Sq Emphysema: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema on imaging. It is important to minimize positive pressure ventilation to prevent worsening of these conditions.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of chronic DVT and is currently on enoxaparin (lovenox) for prophylaxis. Regular monitoring of clotting parameters is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and peg tube for nutrition. He has been receiving antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and MRSA infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to struggle with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and weaning off sedation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: Despite completing a course of antibiotics for VAP, the patient still exhibits fevers and leukocytosis. This could indicate persistent infection or antibiotic resistance. Further evaluation with culture results and clinical monitoring is required.

3. Pneumomediastinum/Sq Emphysema: The patient has signs of pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, which may be due to positive pressure ventilation. Regular follow-up with chest X-rays and minimizing positive pressure ventilation is recommended.

4. Tachycardia/Hypotension: The patient has a persistent tachycardia and hypotension, indicating possible inadequate perfusion. Monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure with appropriate interventions, such as fluid administration or vasopressors, is crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has acute respiratory failure with tracheostomy and peg. The plan is to continue with albuterol and ipratroprium, wean off ventilation, and monitor oxygenation.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: Despite completing a 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the patient has ongoing fevers. Antibiotics have been restarted with vanc/cefepime, and the plan is to follow up with cultures and consider discontinuing antibiotics if no growth is seen.
3. Pneumomediastinum/Sq Emphysema: The patient has pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, and the plan is to continue monitoring chest X-rays and minimize positive pressure ventilation if possible.
4. MAT/Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia without any acute issues.
5. Constipation: The patient is on several medications to manage constipation, including senna, colase, lactulose, and bisacodyl.
6. Hyperthyroid (subclinical): The patient has subclinical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who is admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, tracheostomy tube in place, and oxygen supplementation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/60 to 121/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 163.3 kg at admission to 147.2 kg currently.

The patient has been experiencing increased temperature yesterday, so the antibiotics Cefepime and Vancomycin have been restarted. The patient also had 100cc of bright red partially clotted blood suctioned from the tracheostomy tube, which started running clear. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 4009 mL in total intake and 1155 mL total output.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 154 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 6.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose of 100 mg/dL, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 185 K/uL,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and CPAP/PSV mode. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 552 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's respiratory support will be continued for now.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient completed a 7-day course of vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) several days ago. Despite this, the patient developed a fever last night. New chest X-ray does not suggest recurrence of VAP. The patient has started on vancomycin and cefepime, and the white blood cell count seems to be trending down. Elevated levels of AST, amylase, and lipase may indicate a possible hepatic or pancreatic pathology. An RUQ ultrasound will be performed, and cultures will be followed.

3. Pneumomediastinum/Sq Emphysema: The patient's"

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 84/50 mmHg, and increased respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.4°C (99.4°F). 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,361 mL and output of 1,255 mL over the past 24 hours. His weight has decreased from 163.3 kg at admission to 147.2 kg currently. Laboratory results indicate elevated leukocyte count of 15.1 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 32 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's blood cultures were sent on 08/19 and are still pending. Repeat blood cultures were also sent on 08/20. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray on 08/19, showed"

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers, leukocytosis, and elevated lipase/amylase levels. His imaging results do not show any abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas, but he has an enlargement of the right iliacus muscle, which is likely due to hematoma formation. The patient has also shown signs of altered mental status, constipation, coagulopathy, and respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the body, resulting in organ damage.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase: These symptoms may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, such as pancreatitis or cholecystitis.
3. Pneumomediastinum/Sq Emphysema: The presence of air in the mediastinum or subcutaneous tissue can cause pneumomediastinum or sq emphysema, leading to respiratory distress and potential complications.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation can increase the risk of impaction, fecal retention, and potential bowel ischemia.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with symptoms of respiratory failure, hypoxia, hypercarbia, hemoptysis, and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing fevers, leukocytosis, elevated lipase/amylase levels, and constipation. Imaging shows enlargement of the right iliacus muscle, possibly due to hematoma formation. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, pain management, respiratory support, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which requires ongoing respiratory support.
2. Infection: The presence of fevers, leukocytosis, and elevated lipase/amylase levels may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly pneumonia or cholangitis.
3. Constipation: The patient is constipated, which needs to be managed with laxatives and stool softeners.
4. Hematoma: The enlargement of the right iliacus muscle suggests the presence of a hematoma, which could potentially lead to further complications if not addressed.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires careful management to prevent complications related to electrolyte imbalance.

Note: This summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm these findings and determine the appropriate course of action for the patient."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease.
- He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- Patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lipase/amylase levels.
- There is an enlargement of the right iliacus muscle, possibly due to hematoma formation.
- No evidence of active or arterial extravasation within the hematoma.
- No gallstones or sludge identified on ultrasound.
- Sputum culture shows gram-positive cocci in pairs.
- Blood cultures from previous days show no growth.
- Patient has altered mental status, coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and constipation.
- Various treatments and medications have been administered, including antibiotics, pain management, and bowel regulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, along with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, puts him at risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Elevated white blood cell count, fever, and positive sputum culture suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, which could worsen if not properly managed.
3. Pancreatitis: Elevated lipase/amylase levels may indicate pancreatitis, which can be a serious complication if not treated promptly.
4. Hematoma/Coagulopathy: Enlargement of the right iliacus muscle suggests a hemat"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presented with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving albuterol and ipratropium, and his pain is being managed with fentanyl. There have been attempts to wean him off ventilation.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase suggest a possible pancreatic or gastrointestinal issue. He was previously treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and cefepime, but new CXR does not show recurrence. He is currently on vancomycin and cefepime again, and his amylase, lipase, and liver function tests (LFTs) are being monitored.

The patient also has pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, which is being followed on CXR and is improving. Positive pressure is being minimized. The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was on enoxaparin but stopped recently due to a tracheostomy bleed.

Other medical issues include constipation, hyperthyroidism (subclinical), and hypotension. The patient's sodium level is elevated, and he is receiving tube feeds through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include fever, altered mental status, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and constipation. 

The patient's fever, which has been persistent, indicates an underlying infection or inflammatory process. It is important to identify the source of the fever and initiate appropriate treatment.

The altered mental status could be attributed to multiple factors, including sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or medication side effects. Further assessment is necessary to determine the exact cause and provide appropriate interventions.

Respiratory failure is indicated by the patient's reliance on mechanical ventilation and the need for assisted spontaneous breathing. This suggests a compromised respiratory function, which requires close monitoring and optimization of ventilatory support.

Coagulopathy is suggested by the elevated PT/PTT values and the administration of enoxaparin (Lovenox). Coagulation abnormalities can increase the risk of bleeding or clot formation, necessitating careful management.

Constipation is mentioned as an ongoing issue despite attempts at disimpaction. It is important to address this issue to prevent further complications such as fecal impaction or increased risk of pressure ulcers.

In addition to these primary concerns, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and line management need to be closely monitored and managed accordingly.

It is crucial to review the patient's imaging studies, such as the CT scan mentioned, to gather more information about any potential sources of infection or other underlying conditions.

Overall, the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. He has a fever of 101.6°F, and there is an ongoing investigation into the source of the fever. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. He also has an elevated lipase and amylase level, which may suggest pancreatitis or another pancreatic condition. Imaging studies have not revealed any abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to his severe lung disease. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has a persistent fever despite being on antibiotics. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of the fever.
3. Possible Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection in the body.
4. Elevated Lipase and Amylase: These elevated levels may indicate pancreatitis or another pancreatic condition. However, imaging studies have not shown any abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.
5. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, and stool throughout the colon was seen on a CT scan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers, leukocytosis, elevated lipase/amylase levels, and an unclear etiology. He has completed a 7-day course of vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on cefepime. The patient also has pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, constipation, subclinical hyperthyroidism, chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, and hypernatremia. The patient is receiving tube feeds through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube and has been restarted on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of oxygen delivery devices and ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's persistent fevers and leukocytosis indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Elevated lipase/amylase levels: The patient's elevated lipase and amylase levels suggest pancreatic involvement. Additional imaging"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has been on mechanical ventilation. He has had several medical complications, including fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's temperature has been consistently elevated, indicating an underlying infection or inflammation. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the fever.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is sedated and exhibits slight disconjugate gaze, which may suggest delirium or another neurological issue. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status is necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a bleeding tendency. This could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or the use of anticoagulants.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, as indicated by his dependence on mechanical ventilation. The cause of this failure could be pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or exacerbation of underlying lung disease.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating a potential imbalance in fluid and electrolyte regulation"

   *Increase PS to 10 given tachypnea
   *Failed TC earlier, will hold on further attempts for today
   2. Fevers: Remains febrile on Vanc/Cefipime with negative cultures;
   flagyl recently added
   *Check CT sinus; Blood cultures from line
   3. ARF: Increase in Cr. Got CT 2 days ago, so possible component of

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and severe emphysema. He was admitted with acute respiratory failure related to particulate injury. The patient had difficulty ventilating and required paralysis. He also developed subcutaneous emphysema. 

The patient's fever reached 101.6°F and he failed a trial of weaning from the ventilator. He was started on flagyl for presumptive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Multiple attempts at disimpaction and enemas were performed for constipation. A CT scan showed no evidence of pancreatitis. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. 

The patient is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions. He is also on several other medications including albendazole/atorvastatin, sodium bicarbonate/sodium chloride, lactulose, lovenox, and others. The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), current temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/47 to 144/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26-40 breaths per"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease.
- He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
- He is experiencing fevers and leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase levels, suggesting a possible infection.
- A CT scan of the sinuses did not reveal significant sinusitis.
- The patient has developed a rash, which is suspected to be drug-related.
- His serum creatinine level is elevated, possibly due to post-contrast effects.
- The patient has pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.
- He is also experiencing constipation.
- The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- His blood pressure is low, and he requires careful monitoring.
- The patient has hypernatremia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with respiratory failure, characterized by hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and requires ongoing management with mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator will need to be carefully monitored.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate interventions, such as dialysis, may be necessary.
3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient is experiencing fevers and leukocytosis with elevated lipase and amylase levels. Further investigation is required to determine the underlying cause, which could include infections or other conditions.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, as indicated by prolonged PT/PTT and low INR levels. Monitoring coagulation parameters and providing appropriate coagulation support may be necessary.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status. It is important to assess for delirium and other causes of cognitive impairment, and to provide appropriate supportive care.
6. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may require ongoing monitoring and management to maintain adequate blood pressure and prevent complications such as organ hypoperfusion.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is being treated with albuterol and ipratropium for respiratory distress. 

The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis with elevated lipase and amylase levels, indicating a possible infection. The etiology of the infection is unclear at this time. The patient is already on vancomycin and cefepime, and additional antibiotics such as flagyl and cipro have been added for a possible gastrointestinal source of infection. Cultures have been sent, and the patient will be followed up with amylase/lipase/LFTs.

The patient also has a rash, which is possibly related to drug reactions. There is no significant elevation in eosinophils, so the cause of the rash is still unclear. The patient has been given benadryl, and further follow-up is planned.

The patient's creatinine levels have increased to 2.5, which may be due to post-contrast effects. Intravenous fluids have been given, and the patient's electrolytes will be rechecked.

The patient has pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications seen on imaging"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has several medical complications including acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications to manage his symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure and diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications on imaging may suggest the possibility of ARDS. Close monitoring and management of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lipase/amylase levels raises the suspicion of pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on culture results.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of chronic DVT increases the risk of developing new thrombotic events. Prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin should be continued.
4. Nosocomial Infection: Given the prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and sputum cultures is necessary.
5. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is currently on a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include multi-lumen placement, urine and wound cultures, and blood cultures. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure (BP) ranging from 74/39 mmHg to 90/41 mmHg, and a heart rate (HR) of 84 bpm. His respiratory rate (RR) is 21 insp/min, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 97%. His temperature is within normal range.

The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox). He also has a history of acute renal failure, fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and lactate levels. His electrolytes are also abnormal, showing hypernatremia.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, presenting with hemoptysis, hypoxic, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), a heart rate of 84 bpm, a blood pressure of 90/41 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and altered nutrition.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with low potassium and low magnesium levels.

Imaging studies reveal diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications on chest X-ray, most likely related to vascular congestion and multifocal pneumonia. The patient's microbiology tests are pending, including blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture.

The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, pantoprazole, enoxaparin, acetaminophen, albuterol, chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse, ciprofloxacin, docusate sodium, golytely, insulin, ipratropium bromide, lactulose, metronidazole, midazolam, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, polyethylene glycol, senna, sodium chloride flush, vancomycin, and others.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing albuterol and ipratropium, monitoring discomfort, and weaning off the ventilator. The patient is also on vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, and cipro for possible gastrointestinal source of infection. The cultures and amylase/lipase/LFTs will be followed, and a CT scan of the sinuses will be performed to evaluate for sinusitis. The patient's rash, elevated creatinine, pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, constipation, hyperthyroidism, chronic DVT, hypotension, and hypernatremia will also be monitored and managed accordingly.

Overall, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and has been admitted to the ICU. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase, hypotension, anemia, rash, elevated creatinine, pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, constipation, hyperthyroidism, history of chronic DVT, and hypernatremia.

The patient has been placed on various medications, including albuterol, ipratropium, fentanyl IV, versed, Vanc/Cipro, Meropenem, levophed, and IV fluids. He also has a feeding tube through his PEG for nutrition.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated blood urea nitrogen, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T, low sodium, and abnormal liver function tests.

Imaging studies reveal diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, likely due to vascular congestion and multifocal pneumonia. There is also evidence of pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema.

The patient's overall condition indicates multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including respiratory failure, renal failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and possible sepsis. The patient requires close monitoring and management"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple medications, and has various tubes and lines inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications on imaging suggest the possibility of ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, elevated lipase/amylase, and pending blood cultures indicate a potential infection leading to sepsis.
3. Pneumomediastinum/Sq Emphysema: The presence of subcutaneous emphysema on imaging raises the possibility of pneumomediastinum.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of chronic DVT and the use of Lovenox suggest a risk of thrombosis.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels indicate possible kidney dysfunction.
6. Constipation: The patient's symptoms of constipation may be due to decreased bowel movements.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may require further evaluation and management.

   Imaging: echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is mildly increased with
   free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending
   aorta.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-7-28**], the
   estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is now lower and the
   right ventricular cavity is smaller with improved systolic function.

   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease presents with hemoptysis, and hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure, currently with trach and peg: pt. with
   breath stacking seen on vent and work of breathing with nasal flaring
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - Will monitor discomfort; currently treated with fentanyl IV and
   versed.
   - change vent settings today, match PEEP to autopeep, switch to PCV and
   then titrate sedation so that patient is ventilating all of his carbon
   dioxide.
   - CXR today, r/o pneumothorax given worsening respiratory status.
    # Fevers/Leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase. Unclear etiology
   at this time.
   - finished 8 days Vanc/Cefepime, now on Vanc/Cipro (D1:[**8-23**]), Meropenem
   (D1:[**8-24**])
   - bronch today, may need pedi bronch to get good sputum sample so as to
   be able to narrow antibiotics
   - Follow cultures and amylase/lipase/LFTs
   - f/u blood ctxs
   - f/u  urine ctx
   - ID consult given no gram negative coverage and ?source with fevers
   and leukocytosis; started Meropenem for ESBLs coverage.
   # Hypotension: currently supported with levophed
   -check CVP and a-line to assess
   -fluid bolus if intravascularly deplete
   # Anemia: Likely partially due to hemodilution and recent bleed from
   trache site.  Brother unaware of history of anemia though it HCP
   - f/u iron studies, B12, folate
   # Rash: possibly [**3-9**] drugs. Eos now elevated; no rash today
   - benadryl with close follow up; likely due to Flagyl
   -question if this allergic rxn culd have also been causing renal
   failure
   # Elevated Cr: Possibly post contrast vs AIN, has not been hypotensive
   to suggest ATN
   -check urine eos, sediment; calculate FeNa to determine pre or
   intra-renal disorder
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
   - continue to follow CXR
improving clincially
   - minimize positive pressure if possible
   # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, bisacodyl
   - Added miralax and increased frequency of lactulose
    #Hyperthyroid (subclinical)
   - no acute isssues
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
   - changed to Heparin yesterday as would benefit from IVF and with
   anemia, would be easier to turn off; titrate to goal PTT
   # Hypotension
   - continue to monitor BP and keep MAP > 60

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and has been intubated. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with breath stacking seen on the vent and work of breathing with nasal flaring. He is also experiencing fever, leukocytosis, elevated lipase/amylase levels, and has a history of chronic DVT. The patient's condition has been worsening over the weekend, and he has been diagnosed with various complications including renal failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and altered nutrition. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is currently on multiple antibiotics including Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI)
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI)/renal failure
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
5. Stress ulcers/gastric bleeding
6. Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
7. Constipation
8. Hyperthyroidism (subclinical)
9. Hypotension/low blood pressure
10. Malnutrition/nutritional deficiencies

   Imaging: echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is mildly increased with
   free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending
   aorta.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-7-28**], the
   estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is now lower and the
   right ventricular cavity is smaller with improved systolic function.

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure, currently with trach and peg: pt. with
   breath stacking seen on vent and work of breathing with nasal flaring
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - Will monitor discomfort; currently treated with fentanyl IV and
   versed.
   - change vent settings today, match PEEP to autopeep, switch to PCV and
   then titrate sedation so that patient is ventilating all of his carbon
   dioxide.
   - CXR today, r/o pneumothorax given worsening respiratory status.
    # Fevers/Leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase. Unclear etiology
   at this time.
   - finished 8 days Vanc/Cefepime, now on Vanc/Cipro (D1:[**8-23**]), Meropenem
   (D1:[**8-24**])
   - bronch today, may need pedi bronch to get good sputum sample so as to

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He presents with hemoptysis, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and constipation. He has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis and is currently receiving heparin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, with worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia. The current ventilator settings need to be adjusted to ensure adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal.

2. Infection: The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, along with elevated lipase and amylase levels. This suggests the possibility of an infection, possibly pneumonia or acute pancreatitis. Further evaluation is needed, including sputum cultures and bronchoscopy.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressor support with levophed. The CVP and arterial line readings should be closely monitored, and fluid boluses may be given if intravascular volume is low.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to hemodilution and recent bleeding from the tracheostomy site. Iron studies, B12, and folate levels should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU due to various health complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, the note mentions several events that occurred within a 24-hour period. These events include stool culture results showing c-diff negative, sputum culture results showing contamination, trans-thoracic echo results showing mild right ventricular dilation, and arterial line placement.

The patient has multiple allergies to medications, but no known drug allergies are mentioned. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefipime, metronidazole, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
- Heart Rate: 75 bpm (with a range of 74-85 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 111/58 mmHg (with a range of 76-124/47-63 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 30 breaths per minute (with a range of 17-33 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 95%

The patient's current weight is 162.1 kg, which is slightly lower than their admission weight of 163.3 kg. The patient's height is 74 inches.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 5,103 mL, with an output of 152 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has received a total of 3,546 mL of intravenous fluids and 561 mL of blood products.

The patient is currently on several medications, including heparin sodium, fentanyl concentrate, norepinephrine, midazolam (versed), enoxaparin (lovenox), and pantoprazole (protonix).

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 12 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.28, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 207, and respiratory rate (RR) at 32 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, and neurologic examination are not assessed. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 230 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 23.2%, decreased platelet count (Plt) at 195 K/uL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) at 3.2 mg/dL.

   Imaging: echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is mildly increased with
   free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending
   aorta.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-7-28**], the
   estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is now lower and the
   right ventricular cavity is smaller with improved systolic function.

   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease now with respiratory failure and worsening renal failure..
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure, currently with trach and peg: pt. with
   breath stacking seen on vent and work of breathing with nasal flaring
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   - Will monitor discomfort; currently treated with fentanyl IV and
   versed.
   - change vent settings today, match PEEP to autopeep, switch to PCV and
   then titrate sedation so that patient is ventilating all of his carbon
   dioxide.
   - CXR today, r/o pneumothorax given worsening respiratory status.
   #Renal Failure
   -worsening renal failure with Urine eos.  Possible AIN vs renal
   stenosis vs [**3-9**] sepsis.
   -renal U/S with dopplers today
   -c/s renal
    # Fevers/Leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase. Unclear etiology
   at this time.
   - finished 8 days Vanc/Cefepime, now on Vanc/Cipro (D2:[**8-23**]), Meropenem
   (D2:[**8-24**])
   - bronch today, may need pedi bronch to get good sputum sample so as to
   be able to narrow antibiotics
   - Follow cultures and amylase/lipase/LFTs
   - f/u blood ctxs
   - f/u  urine ctx
   -f/u sputum cx from bronch o/n.
   # Hypotension: currently supported with levophed
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
   - continue to follow CXR
improving clincially
   - AM CXR
   # Anemia: Likely partially due to hemodilution and recent bleed from
   trache site.  Brother unaware of history of anemia though it HCP
   - f/u iron studies, B12, folate
   # Rash: possibly [**3-9**] drugs. Eos now elevated; no rash today
   - benadryl with close follow up; likely due to Flagyl
   -question if this allergic rxn culd have also been causing renal
   failure
   # Elevated Cr: Possibly post contrast vs AIN, has not been hypotensive
   to suggest ATN
   -check urine eos, sediment; calculate FeNa to determine pre or
   intra-renal disorder
   # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, bisacodyl
   - Added miralax and increased frequency of lactulose
    #Hyperthyroid (subclinical)
   - no acute isssues
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
   - changed to Heparin yesterday as would benefit from IVF and with
   anemia, would be easier to turn off; titrate to goal PTT
   # Hypotension
   - continue to monitor BP and keep MAP > 60

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. The patient is currently in respiratory failure and has worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and exhibits breath stacking, indicating difficulty in exhaling. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory effort and adjusting ventilator settings will be necessary to ensure proper ventilation.

2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). Further investigations, such as a renal ultrasound with doppler, are needed to determine the underlying cause of renal failure. Management may involve fluid restriction, diuretics, and potentially dialysis.

3. Fevers/Leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase: The patient has been febrile and leukocytic with elevated lipase and amylase levels. This could suggest an infectious process, possibly in the lungs or pancreas. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. A bronchoscopy may be required to obtain a good sputum sample for microbiological analysis.

4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressor support with norepinephrine. Close monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining a mean arterial pressure above 60"

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has breath stacking seen on the ventilator and is showing signs of increased work of breathing with nasal flaring. This indicates a potential exacerbation of the respiratory failure.
2. Worsening renal failure: The patient's urine eosinophils are elevated, suggesting possible acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) as a cause for the worsening renal function. There is also a possibility of renal stenosis or sepsis contributing to the renal failure.
3. Fevers/leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase: These findings suggest a potential infection, possibly leading to sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient is supported with levophed, indicating the need for vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure.
5. Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema: The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Continued follow-up with CXR is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, worsening renal failure, and other medical complications. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe lung disease and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for hypoxic respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, leading to acute renal failure. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as suggested by the presence of granular casts in the urine.

3. Sepsis: The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, indicating an infection. Blood cultures are pending, and the source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently experiencing bleeding from various sites, including the tracheostomy site, retroperitoneal bleeding, and bleeding from the Foley catheter. This suggests a bleeding disorder or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as hypoxia, sepsis, or the effects of medications.

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has impaired skin integrity, rash, renal failure, fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the organizing hematoma in the right psoas/illiacus area. This complication can lead to further respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine and urea levels. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is suspected rather than acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). This complication may progress to chronic kidney disease if not addressed promptly.

3. Fever and leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase: The patient has fevers and elevated white blood cell count with elevated lipase/amylase levels, suggesting possible infection or pancreatic involvement. Further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause.

4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires support with levophed. There is a history of bleeding from the tracheostomy site and retroperitoneal bleeding, indicating potential coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular"

   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease now with respiratory failure and worsening renal failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure, currently with trach and peg: CT
   suggestive of ARDS
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   -check q2 ABG. Pt had worsening acidosis yesterday.
   -[**8-25**] patient had marked improvement in ABG after given fluid. Think
   that this improves his blood flow to ventilating portion of lungs. Last
   night BP improved after 1L of fluid, but had minimal improvement in
   ABG. Continues to have high stroke variance. Will give more fluid today
   and monitor I/Os and ABG.
   - Considering bicarb not rising enough given respiratory acidosis
   suggests a component of non- gap metabolic acidosis. Losses would be
   via GI tract. Or, if kidneys were not excreting enough anions [**3-9**] renal
   failure, that would also drive bicarb down. Given bicarb yesterday.
   Will give fluid in the form of D5 with 3amps of bicarb and monitor ABGs
   today.  Will also titrate bowel regimen to 200-350cc bowel loss.
   #Renal Failure: Per Renal this is ATN and not AIN. Renal U/S were
   normal.  No steroids at this time
   -like renal failure causing poor excretion of anions which is driving
   bicarb down.
   -Will give bicarb and monitor response.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase. Unclear etiology at
   this time.
   - finished 8 days Vanc/Cefepime, now on Vanc  and Meropenem day [**4-12**] for
   8d VAP coarse.
   - f/u blood ctxs
   - f/u  urine ctx
   - also sending CMV virology
   # Hypotension: currently off levophed
   - Showed some improvement with 1L last night
   - Will try D5 with bicarb today and monitor response.
   # Anemia: Pt has h/o of bleeding from trach site and now has
   retroperitoneal bleeding and bleeding from foley. Must weigh bleeding
   vs. PE given h/o dvt
   - given Hct is stable, will continue heparin for now and check Hct Q6
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
 Tightened goal PTT, however pt started bleeding
   last night from foley. Foley was changed yesterday so likely [**3-9**] foley
   trauma
   - Will check for DVT with BLE u/s. If no DVT, will stop heparin.
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
 resolving
   - continue to follow CXR
improving clincially
    # Constipation
   - on senna, colase, bisacodyl
   - miralax and lactulose
     #Hyperthyroid (subclinical)
   - no acute isssues
    # Hypotension
   - continue to monitor BP and keep MAP > 60

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates an impaired ability to breathe adequately, leading to insufficient oxygen levels in the blood.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The CT scan suggests the possibility of ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by widespread inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.

3. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, leukocytosis, and elevated lipase/amylase levels suggest an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis if not promptly treated.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function and presence of granular casts in urine indicate acute kidney injury, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of bleeding from various sites, including the tracheostomy, retroperitoneal hematoma, and Foley catheter, suggest a bleeding tendency that could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or anticoagulation therapy.

6. Altered mental status: The patient's occasional grimace and unclear response to verbal stimuli indicate a decline in mental status, which may be related to various factors such as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently in respiratory failure and has worsening renal failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and is receiving various medications including sedatives, pain medication, antibiotics, and medications for his other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. This could progress to acute renal failure if not managed properly.
3. Fever and leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count along with increased levels of lipase and amylase suggests a possible infection or pancreatitis.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of bleeding from the tracheostomy site, retroperitoneal bleeding, and bleeding from the Foley catheter. This raises concerns about coagulopathy and potential bleeding events.
5. Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema: The patient has evidence of air leakage into the mediastinum, which may indicate barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.
6. Constipation: The patient is at risk of developing constipation due to decreased"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently in respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. He has impaired skin integrity, rash, fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 127/67 mmHg, respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 94%, and CVP 13 mmHg. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, low Hct, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, low potassium, and other abnormal lab values. Imaging reveals improved lung aeration compared to the previous day. Microbiology tests are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation indicate difficulty in ventilating effectively.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's CT scan suggests ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the alveoli.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and worsening renal function indicate potential acute kidney injury.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of bleeding, low platelet count, and prolonged PTT suggest a bleeding disorder.
5. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's elevated body temperature and white"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure and worsening renal function. The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, rash, acute renal failure, fever, altered nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure suggests a potential complication of hypoxia due to inadequate oxygenation.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's chest X-ray shows improved lung aeration compared to the previous day, indicating a possibility of ARDS.
3. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG results indicate a lower pH level and bicarbonate concentration, suggesting the presence of metabolic acidosis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels indicate worsening renal function, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
5. Infection: The presence of fever and leukocytosis raises suspicion for an underlying infection, potentially leading to sepsis if not properly managed.
6. Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema: The patient's history of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema may complicate his respiratory status and increase the risk of further lung damage.

   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure, currently with trach and peg: CT
   suggestive of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] vs ARDS
   -current Vt near 6cc/kg
   -FiO2 increased overnight due to hypoxemia
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   -check q4 ABG.
   -respiratory acidosis with minimal change from yesterday
   - Considering bicarb not rising enough given respiratory acidosis
   suggests a component of non- gap metabolic acidosis; possible HD would
   help with anion excretion
   #Renal Failure: Per Renal ATN vs AIN.  Renal U/S were normal.  Started
   prednisone dosed by IBW: prednisone 80mg IV
   -likely renal failure causing poor excretion of anions which is driving
   bicarb down.
   -eval by IR for line placement for HD after f/u with renal if plan for
   HD.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase. Unclear etiology at
   this time.
   - finished 8 days Vanc/Cefepime, now on Meropenem (D1:[**8-24**]) day [**6-12**] for
   8d VAP coarse.

   -BPs stable
   # Anemia: Pt has h/o of bleeding from trach site and now has
   retroperitoneal bleeding and bleeding from foley. Must weigh bleeding
   vs. PE given h/o dvt
   -stable currently
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
 Tightened goal PTT, however pt started bleeding
   last night from foley. Foley has been changed so likely [**3-9**] foley
   trauma
   -since no DVT on U/S, continue to hold Heparin today for 2-3 days with
   plan to restart on Monday.  If continues to bleed, will need IVC
   filter.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a rash, which may indicate impaired skin integrity.
2. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
3. Fever (Pyrexia): The patient is experiencing fevers, which could be due to an infection or other causes.
4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has altered nutrition, possibly due to poor oral intake or malabsorption.
5. Constipation (Obstipation): The patient is experiencing constipation, which may be related to decreased mobility or medication use.
6. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient has acute respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. The exact cause is still being evaluated.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy, indicated by abnormal bleeding from different sites.
8. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient is experiencing altered mental status, possibly due to sedation or underlying medical conditions.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure, currently with trach and peg: CT
   suggestive of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] vs ARDS
   -current Vt near 6cc/kg
   -FiO2 increased overnight due to hypoxemia
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   -check q4 ABG.
   -respiratory acidosis with minimal change from yesterday
   - Considering bicarb not rising enough given respiratory acidosis
   suggests a component of non- gap metabolic acidosis; possible HD would
   help with anion excretion
   #Renal Failure: Per Renal ATN vs AIN.  Renal U/S were normal.  Started
   prednisone dosed by IBW: prednisone 80mg IV
   -likely renal failure causing poor excretion of anions which is driving
   bicarb down.
   -eval by IR for line placement for HD after f/u with renal if plan for
   HD.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase. Unclear etiology at
   this time.
   - finished 8 days Vanc/Cefepime, now on Meropenem (D1:[**8-24**]) day [**6-12**] for
   8d VAP coarse.

   retroperitoneal bleeding and bleeding from foley. Must weigh bleeding
   vs. PE given h/o dvt
   -stable currently
   # Hx of Chronic DVT
 Tightened goal PTT, however pt started bleeding
   last night from foley. Foley has been changed so likely [**3-9**] foley

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a rash, which may indicate impaired skin integrity. This could be due to pressure sores or other factors, and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent further complications.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration for dialysis may be necessary.
3. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers, which could be indicative of an underlying infection. Further evaluation and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be required.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which could be attributed to various factors such as sedation, electrolyte imbalances, or central nervous system involvement. Monitoring and addressing these factors may help improve mental status.
5. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which should be managed with appropriate laxatives and stool softeners to prevent complications like impaction.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy, as indicated by elevated D-dimer levels and bleeding from different sites. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management to prevent further bleeding episodes are essential.

   1.       Respiratory Failure:  Will increase respiratory rate on vent
   given hypercarbia.  Given FIO2 of .35, can consider moving away a true
   low tidal volume strategy.
   2.       ESRD: Cont CVVH to remove fluid.  Check albumin
   3.       Ventilator associated PNA: Day [**6-12**] meropenem
   4.       Sedation: requiring high dose of fentanyl/versed.  More
   liberal vent setting may help with this
   Remainder of issues per ICU team.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with respiratory failure due to particulate inhalation. He has been in the ICU and is now requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and metabolic/fluid derangements. The patient's respiratory distress has increased overnight but responded to bronchodilators. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 35% and a respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/49 to 147/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 5 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 83%. The patient has received multiple medications including calcium gluconate, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. He is also receiving tube feeds and has an orogastric tube in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and increased PIPs indicate ongoing respiratory failure. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. ESRD: The patient's renal function is compromised, necess"

    -current Vt near 6cc/kg
   -FiO2 increased overnight due to hypoxemia
   - continue albuterol and ipratroprium
   -check q4 ABG.
   -respiratory acidosis with minimal change from yesterday
   - Considering bicarb not rising enough given respiratory acidosis
   suggests a component of non- gap metabolic acidosis; possible HD would
   help with anion excretion
   #Renal Failure: Per Renal ATN vs AIN.  Renal U/S were normal.  Started
   prednisone dosed by IBW: prednisone 80mg IV
   -likely renal failure causing poor excretion of anions which is driving
   bicarb down.
   -eval by IR for line placement for HD after f/u with renal if plan for
   HD.

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, rash, acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's respiratory failure is due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, currently being managed with a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient also has worsening renal failure, which may be caused by renal ATN (acute tubular necrosis) or AIN (acute interstitial nephritis). 

The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis with elevated lipase and amylase levels, indicating a possible infection or pancreatitis. The etiology of these symptoms is unclear at this time. 

The patient's hypotension requires the use of vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The patient also has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism. 

Additionally, the patient has anemia due to bleeding from various sources such as the tracheostomy site, retroperitoneal bleeding, and bleeding from the Foley catheter. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems, including the respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently in respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a rash, which can be indicative of pressure ulcers or other skin integrity issues commonly seen in critically ill patients.
2. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by the worsening renal function and the need for dialysis.
3. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which could be due to an infection or other underlying condition. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, including disconjugate gaze and poorly reactive pupils. This may be related to sedation or an underlying neurological condition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is struggling with hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a concern for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) versus [Doctor Last Name 2].
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of chronic DVT and is currently bleeding from various sites. This indicates a need for careful management of coagulation parameters and consideration for anticoagulation therapy.
7. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, likely due to decreased mobility and medications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is mechanically ventilated. The vital signs show a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 99%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.25, which is slightly acidic, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 234, suggesting some degree of hypoxemia.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by an increase in serum creatinine levels from 3.5 to 4.1 mg/dL and a decrease in urine output. The fluid balance shows a significant negative balance, indicating potential dehydration.

3. Fever: The patient has had intermittent fevers since admission, with the highest recorded temperature being 38.3°C (100.9°F) on 08/29/2178 at 05:15 PM. The source of the fever is not identified.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has developed a rash, which may be due to pressure or friction from being bedridden.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status but does not meet the criteria for delirium. They are not following commands and their responses are not assessed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. He has leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase levels, and there is uncertainty regarding the etiology. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungal medications. There are concerns about impaired skin integrity, rash, renal failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and anemia. The patient also has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Fungal infection: The patient has received antifungal treatment, suggesting a suspicion or confirmation of a fungal infection.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): Given the multiple lines and catheters in place, there is a risk of developing a bloodstream infection related to these devices.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, which may progress to AKI.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient has an existing coccyx ulceration, indicating potential pressure ulcer formation due to prolonged immobility.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase levels, suggesting possible pancreatitis or infection. There is a positive growth of GNR in the sputum culture. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but given the presence of GNR, additional coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa is being added. The patient also has constipation, which has been treated with laxatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for VAP due to the presence of GNR in the sputum culture. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be maintained, and further cultures may be needed to monitor for any changes.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and oliguria. Renal replacement therapy may be required soon. The cause of AKI could be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or drug-induced nephrotoxicity (AIN). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and guide treatment.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has haptoglobin levels below 20 and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting a hemolytic process. A disseminated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, now experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. He presents with fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lipase/amylase levels. The etiology of these symptoms is unclear, and cultures have been obtained. He is currently being treated with antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient also has anemia, hemolytic in nature, and is being evaluated for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He is hypotensive and has experienced bleeding from various sites, leading to a consideration for an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Additionally, the patient has constipation, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease has led to acute respiratory failure. It is essential to monitor his oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamic status closely.
2. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and oliguria. Immediate attention is needed to address this issue and prevent further renal damage.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms suggest the possibility of VAP, which can be a serious complication in critically"

The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions, including mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and antibiotic therapy. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a rash, which may be due to pressure ulcers or other causes.
2. Renal failure, acute: The patient is experiencing worsening renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
3. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers, which could be indicative of an infection or systemic inflammatory response.
4. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be related to sedation, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying conditions.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of bleeding from tracheostomy site, retroperitoneal bleeding, and bleeding from Foley catheter, suggesting a possible coagulation disorder.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is concern for ARDS or other causes of respiratory failure.
7. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which may be due to decreased mobility, medications, or other factors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. He has multiple comorbidities, including a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

The patient's recent progress includes worsening hypotension requiring vasopressors, increased temperature and white blood cell count, elevated lipase and amylase levels, and positive cultures for gram-negative bacteria in the sputum. He has also had episodes of disconjugate gaze and poorly reactive pupils, which improved with sedation weaning. Additionally, the patient has developed constipation, pneumomediastinum, and subclinical hyperthyroidism.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin, meropenem, and citalopram. He is also receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, as indicated by the need for increasing ventilatory support and the presence of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Worsening renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, evidenced by the elevated creatinine levels and the need for dialysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, worsening renal failure, fever, and leukocytosis. The patient has impaired skin integrity, rash, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and anemia. He also has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AIN) and is being treated with corticosteroids. He has been on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and has developed pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, which are resolving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) or catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTI).
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of DVT and current immobilization increase the risk of PE.
4. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed appropriately.
5. Delirium: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   51-year-old man with respiratory failure, ARF, and hemodynamic
   instability.
   We will plan:
   1) Respiratory failure
     * Improved with increased sedation
     * Vt @ 6cc/kg
     * D/C oral naloxone
   2) shock
 now off pressors
   3) Bandemia
   -          Source of infection is not clear: PNA, C diff, urine
   -          Agree with expansion of GNR coverage
   -          Discuss with ID regarding vanco and expansion to fungemic
   coverage.
   3) acute renal failure
   -          Recheck urine eos today since we will be changing
   antibiotics

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hemodynamic instability, bandemia, and anemia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are any issues with ventilation, oxygenation, or if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not appropriately addressed.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if there is inadequate fluid management, if the cause of renal failure is not identified and treated, or if there are complications such as sepsis or hypotension.

3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability may recur if there are issues with fluid balance, if the cardiac function is compromised, or if there is ongoing infection or inflammation.

4. Bandemia: The patient's bandemia indicates a possible infection, and if the source of infection is not identified and treated, it can lead to further complications such as sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if the underlying cause, such as hemolysis or blood loss, is not addressed. Additionally, if the patient is unable to tolerate heparin, there may be an increased risk of thrombotic events.

6. History of DVT: The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) increases the risk of thrombotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, currently in respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. He has leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase, and the etiology is unclear. He has a positive urinary analgesic with many white blood cells and gram-negative rods in the sputum. He is being treated with multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a rash, which could be due to pressure ulcers or an allergic reaction to medications.
2. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels.
3. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has an elevated temperature, which may indicate an infection.
4. Alteration in nutrition: The patient may have a malnutrition problem due to impaired gut function or inadequate nutritional intake.
5. Constipation (obstipation, fos): The patient has difficulty passing stool, which can lead to further complications if not addressed.
6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/Doctor Last Name 2): The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and may require mechanical ventilation.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of bleeding and anemia, indicating a possible blood clotting disorder.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase levels. There is no clear etiology at this time, but the patient is being treated with antibiotics due to GNR in sputum. The patient's condition is complicated by impaired skin integrity, rash, renal failure, fever, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, anemia, hypotension, and a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a rash and impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of infections.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia.
3. Fever: The patient has a fever, indicating an underlying infection or inflammatory process.
4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has constipation and altered mental status, which may affect their nutritional intake.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and hypercarbia.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding complications.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, now experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. He has leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase, unclear etiology at this time. The patient is currently on multiple medications for various conditions, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, metoprolol, and micafungin. He is also being treated for atrial fibrillation, renal failure, fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to underlying lung disease and is currently managed with mechanical ventilation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal failure may be due to acute tubular necrosis or interstitial nephritis. Renal replacement therapy and careful fluid management are necessary.
3. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient's sputum culture grew pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common hospital-acquired infection. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored to cover this organism.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, requiring rate control with metoprolol.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy could be related to renal failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Monitoring coagulation parameters"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has leukocytosis with elevated lipase/amylase levels, but the etiology is unclear at this time. He also has fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and impaired skin integrity.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has been diagnosed with AFIB with rapid ventricular response. He has been started on metoprolol for rate control.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a rash and impaired skin integrity, possibly due to pressure ulcers or other causes.
3. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's renal function has worsened, leading to acute renal failure. He is being treated for funguria with Micafungin.
4. Fever (Pyrexia): The patient has had a fever, but the cause is not yet identified. Further investigation is needed.
5. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may have altered nutrition due to respiratory failure.
6. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, possibly due to medications or reduced mobility.
7. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a possibility of COPD exacerbation. The chest X-ray suggests possible pulmonary edema vs. ARDS.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which may be contributing to bleeding from various sites.
9. Altered Mental Status: The patient is agitated and has altered mental status, possibly due to sedation, withdrawal, or other causes.
10. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension that requires pressor support and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
11. Anemia: The patient has anemia due to bleeding from various sites, including the tracheostomy site and retroperitoneal bleeding.
12. History of Chronic DVT: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but current ultrasound did not show any DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate antibiotics have been started.
2. Fungal infection: The patient has positive urine cultures for fungus, and Micafungin has been initiated.
3. Withdrawal syndrome: The patient may be at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal given long-term use of Versed.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and immobilization.

   - pt failed spontaneous breathing trial, AC resumed
   - Cont albuerol and ipratroprium
   -Q4 ABG check
   - Will try to find cause of failure to wean.
        - Could be weakness. Will obtain NIF.  If NIF suggests weakness
   will obtain brain MRI/spine for bleed/stroke. Also check TFTs because
   hypothyroidism could cause weaknes.
        - If NIF inconclusive will obtain chest CT to evaluate progression
   of lung disease

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation (AFib), impaired skin integrity, rash, acute renal failure (ARF), fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 110/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium and creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals no significant changes in the chest X-ray, but there is evidence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture.

The plan includes continued treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fungal infection, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's sedation regimen has been adjusted to address agitation and discomfort. Renal failure management involves continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and daily urine eosinophil monitoring for acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient's anemia and history of bleeding complications are being closely monitored. Hypotension is being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and has worsening renal function. The CT chest shows findings suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rather than [Doctor Last Name 2]. The patient has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, rash, renal failure, fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. The physician has started the patient on antibiotics for VAP prophylaxis.
2. Fungal infection: The patient has funguria, and fluconazole has been started. There is a concern for a fungal ball in the renal system, so cystoscopy may be considered.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of bleeding from the tracheostomy site, retroperitoneal bleeding, and bleeding from the Foley catheter. The patient is on heparin therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding. The physician needs to weigh the risk of bleeding against the potential benefit of anticoagulation.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and efforts are being made to improve renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications, including decubitus ulcer, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, rash, acute renal failure, fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to severe lung disease with cystic emphysema at the apices, fibrosis at the bases, and upper lobe traction bronchiectasis. The presence of new pneumomediastinum suggests the possibility of barotrauma.

2. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. The cause of acute renal failure needs further investigation.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of bleeding from the tracheostomy site and previous bleeding events. There is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other coagulopathies.

4. Fever: The patient is experiencing fever, which could be due to an infection or another underlying cause. Further investigation is necessary to determine the source of infection.

   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease now with respiratory failure and worsening renal failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure, currently with trach and peg: CT
   suggestive of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] vs ARDS. Likely cause of failure to wean is poor lung
   function. 75% of lung is dead space.
   - NIF was relatively normal at -39, therefore weakness less likely
   cause of continued respiratory failure. Furthermore, CT head/spine
   shows no stroke
   - Free T4 normal, suggesting hypothyroidism not related to this issue
   - Heparin drip restarted
   - Attempt to reduce PEEP pressures
   - Cont albuerol and ipratroprium
   -Q4 ABG check
   - SBT qday
   # VAP: On Vacn, Cipro (D1 [**8-31**]), Meropenum (D1 [**8-24**]).
    - Follow sputum cultures for speciation
    - Follow blood cultures
   #Sedation: Goal is to get sedation under control with fentanyl  patch
   and/or morphine
   - Propofol w/ fentanyl IV as needed for pain control.
   - Will try fentanyl patch today
   #Funguria
   - Fluconazole started yesterday because PARAPSILOSIS more sensitive to
   parapsilosis and fluconazole more concentrated in urine. Day [**7-19**]
   - Consider cystoscopy per renal to ensure no fungal ball
    # Afib w/ RVR
   -Metoprolol to 37.5 mg TID for rate control
   -not currently a good candidate for cardioversion
   #Renal Failure: Per Renal ATN vs AIN.  Being treated for funguria
    -Cont CVVH to make pt even
   - Checking daily urine eos for AIN
   - D/C methylprednisolone
   - f/u with renal recs. Renal considering starting HD tomorrow
   # Anemia: Pt has h/o of bleeding from trach site and had
   retroperitoneal bleeding and bleeding from foley. Must weigh bleeding
   vs. PE given h/o dvt. HCT currently stable
    -check Q12. goal HCT > 28
    # Hx of Chronic DVT
 U/S did not show DVT
   -HCT stable, restarted heparin gtt

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications including decubitus ulcer, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, rash, acute renal failure, fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by poor lung function, with 75% of the lung being dead space. The CT scan shows severe emphysematous changes and ground-glass opacity in the lungs. The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving sedation with propofol and fentanyl IV.

The patient also has acute renal failure, indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and BUN. He has been treated with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to remove toxins from the blood. The patient's renal failure is being managed by the renal team, who are considering starting hemodialysis tomorrow.

The patient has a history of bleeding from the tracheostomy site, retroperitoneal bleeding, and bleeding from the Foley catheter. His hemoglobin concentration is stable, but there is a concern for anemia. The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but the ultrasound did not show any evidence of DVT. Hepar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications including decubitus ulcer, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, rash, acute renal failure, fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely due to poor lung function. The patient's lung is mostly composed of dead space, making it difficult to ventilate properly.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation. There are already sensitivities showing resistance to certain antibiotics, so it is important to monitor with chest X-rays and sputum cultures.
3. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI): With multiple lines and catheters in place, there is a risk of developing a bloodstream infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be considered.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of chronic DVT, and there is a risk of developing further thrombotic events. Heparin therapy is being continued, and an ultrasound did not show any new DVT.
5. Renal Failure: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease who is currently experiencing respiratory failure and renal failure. 

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to hypercarbic respiratory failure, with the CT scan suggesting a diagnosis of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) rather than [Doctor Last Name 2]. The poor lung function is likely causing the failure to wean from mechanical ventilation.

The patient also has renal failure, which has been treated for acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient will be starting hemodialysis today and daily urine eosinophils will be monitored for AIN. 

Other medical complications and conditions include an atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, fever, altered mental status, constipation, coagulopathy, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's medication regimen includes various antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sedatives such as propofol and fentanyl for pain control, antifungal medication for funguria, and cardiac medications for rate control in atrial fibrillation.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and systemic anticoagulation with heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis."

   #Sedation: Goal is to get sedation under control with fentanyl  patch
   and/or morphine
   - Propofol w/ fentanyl IV as needed for pain control. Pt needed 200 of
   Fentanyl overnight
   - Started fentanyl patch last night. Will try to see if fentanyl patch
   reduced need for propofol over course of next several days.
   - Monitor amylase and lipase.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with ongoing respiratory failure after an inhalational injury. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and renal failure. His condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are any issues with the mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not effectively treated.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's VAP can progress and lead to further respiratory complications or systemic infection if not appropriately managed.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if there is inadequate management of fluid balance, electrolyte imbalances, or if the underlying cause of renal failure is not addressed.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not appropriately managed, which could further compromise his oxygen delivery and overall condition.
5. Funguria: The presence of fungus in the urine indicates a potential fungal infection. If left untreated, it could lead to disseminated fungal infection.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent clot formation.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylactic measures should"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. They have multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), funguria (presence of fungus in urine), and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 65-94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-153 mmHg, respiratory rate between 18-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has been receiving various medications, including micafungin, vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently doing well on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV). However, there is a potential risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to high airway pressures.
2. VAP: The patient is being treated for VAP with antibiotics, but there is still a risk of progression or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Funguria: The patient has been diagnosed with funguria, and treatment involves initiating antifungal therapy and bladder irrigation. There is a risk of spreading the fungal infection or developing resistance to antifungal medications.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is being initiated on hemodialysis (HD) due to renal failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, respiratory failure, and worsening renal failure. He has a history of bleeding complications, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, anemia, chronic deep vein thrombosis, and pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema. The patient's current medical conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, coagulopathy, fever, constipation, and decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with VAP. Antibiotics have been started, and further monitoring with chest X-rays and sputum cultures will be done.
2. Resistance to antibiotics: The patient has shown resistance to certain antibiotics, specifically Cipro and [Last Name (un) 1540]. Sensitivity testing indicates sensitivity to gentamicin and tobramycin. These antibiotics will be considered for treatment.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he requires hemodialysis. Close monitoring of kidney function and following renal recommendations will be essential.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of bleeding from various sites, including the tracheostomy site and retroperitoneal bleeding. Blood products and careful monitoring will be required to manage any bleeding episodes.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently in respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection, funguria, sedation control issues, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, anemia, history of chronic deep vein thrombosis, pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, hypotension, and skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely due to poor lung function. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging.
2. Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas Infection: The patient has a resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection that has not responded to previous antibiotics. Tobramycin has been loaded, and its levels will be monitored before each dialysis session.
3. Funguria: The patient has funguria, and fluconazole has been started as it is more sensitive to parapsilosis and concentrated in urine.
4. Sedation Control: The patient's sedation needs to be managed with fentanyl patch and/or morphine, as the patient is still experiencing pain and discomfort.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/ RVR): The patient had AFib w/ RVR, but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns regarding the patient's pain control, decubitus ulcer, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, rash, acute renal failure, fever, alteration in nutrition, constipation, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to poor lung function and hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is also a concern for ARDS or [Doctor Last Name 2] based on the CT scan.
2. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be caused by factors such as hypotension, nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient has resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas and funguria, indicating a possible infection. There is also a concern for catheter-related bloodstream infection.
4. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer, which needs to be monitored and managed properly to prevent further complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and rate control is necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and peg tube in place. The CT scan suggests ARDS versus [Doctor Last Name 2]. The likely cause of failure to wean is poor lung function, with 75% of the lung being dead space.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including Tobramycin and Gentamicin, but still has resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas. This indicates a high risk of pneumonia.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is being treated with hemodialysis (HD). There is a need to monitor kidney function and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of chronic DVT, and there is a concern about the presence of a new DVT due to immobilization in the ICU. Heparin gtt is being used as prophylaxis.
4. Stress Ulcer: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP, and measures such as elevating the head of bed, mouth care, and monitoring RS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal function. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and has been diagnosed with resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection, for which he is being treated with Tobramycin. He also has funguria and is being treated with fluconazole. The patient has a history of bleeding complications and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is also experiencing renal failure and anemia. The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the underlying severe lung disease and the current infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is already compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient has a resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection, which can be difficult to treat and may lead to complications.
4. Fungal Infection: The patient has funguria and is at risk of developing a fungal infection, particularly paraplegia.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient's history of bleeding complications increases the risk of further bleeding events.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be managed carefully to maintain heart rate control and prevent thromboembolic events.

   #Sedation: Goal is to get sedation under control with fentanyl  patch
   and/or morphine
   - Fentanyl patch increased to 150 however patient kept making facial
   grimmaces and seemed in pain at night. Went up on propofol drip.
   -Amylase/lipase now elevated-> d/c propfol, go to fentanyl prn and low

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection, funguria, sedation issues, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, anemia, chronic deep vein thrombosis, pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, hypotension, and skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's poor lung function may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient has a resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection, which can be difficult to treat and may require additional antibiotic therapy.
3. Funguria: The presence of fungus in the urine indicates a potential fungal infection, which needs to be addressed with antifungal medication.
4. Sedation Issues: The patient's facial grimaces and response to pain suggest ongoing sedation control issues.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs rate control and management of associated complications.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function requires ongoing monitoring and management.
7. Anemia: The patient's history of bleeding and chronic deep vein thrombosis necessitates careful consideration of blood transfusion and ant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection, funguria, sedation issues, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, renal failure, anemia, history of chronic deep vein thrombosis, pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema, hypotension, and skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This may require ongoing ventilatory support and careful monitoring of blood gases.
2. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient has a resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection. This requires aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics, such as tobramycin and possibly colistin.
3. Funguria: The patient has funguria, indicating a fungal infection in the urinary tract. Treatment with fluconazole is recommended.
4. Sedation Issues: The patient's sedation needs to be carefully managed due to pancreatitis. Fentanyl drip for sedation and pain control is currently being used, but adjustments may be needed if switched to assist-control ventilation.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control medications, such as"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease who is currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications that can arise due to his condition:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to adequately ventilate is causing an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, leading to respiratory failure.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed pressure ulcers or bedsores, which are a common complication in critically ill patients who are immobile or spend extended periods in bed.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant medications (heparin and warfarin) to prevent thrombosis. This increases the risk of hemorrhage, especially considering the patient's history of bleeding from tracheostomy site and retroperitoneal bleeding.

4. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.

5. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient's body temperature is elevated, indicating an infection or inflammatory process.

6. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing changes in cognitive function, which can be attributed to various factors such as sedation, sepsis, or multi-organ dysfunction"

   post HD monday(per pharmacy). All other antibiotics stopped.
   -check Tobra level prior to HD and dose accordingly
   -cont Tobra, D1= [**9-4**], day [**2090-7-18**] days
   -check with lab for colistin sensitivities, hold colistin for now due
   to renal tox.
   #Funguria
   - Cont fluconazole because PARAPSILOSIS more sensitive to fluconazole
   and its more concentrated in urine. Day [**1-18**] (day 1 [**8-29**])

   - Urine cultures negative
   #Renal Failure: Treated for AIN
   - renal to recommended either HD or UF, wait renal recs for plan.
   #Sedation: Currently requiring 100microgram boluses of fentanyl q1hr as
   well as increased fentanyl to 200 microgram patchyesterday
   -D/C fentanyl drip, increase fentanyl patch, give fentanyl bolus for
   sedation/pain control
   -started standing clonazepam for anxiety
   -ABGs as above
    # Afib w/ RVR: appears in NSR now
   -Metoprolol to 25 mg TID for rate control
   # Anemia: Pt has h/o of bleeding from trach site and had
   retroperitoneal bleeding and bleeding from foley. Must weigh bleeding
   vs. PE given h/o dvt. HCT currently stable

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, currently in respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, currently on a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, with a CT suggestive of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema versus ARDS. The likely cause of failure to wean is poor lung function, with 75% of the lung being dead space.

The patient has resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection, being treated with tobramycin and gentamicin. The plan is to check tobramycin levels on Monday morning prior to hemodialysis (HD), and adjust the dose accordingly. If the level is above 2.5, then give 100 mg post HD on Monday, and if below 2.5, then give 120 mg post HD on Monday. Other antibiotics have been stopped.

The patient also has funguria, and fluconazole is being continued because of increased sensitivity to fluconazole and its higher concentration in urine. The bladder washings have been discontinued.

The patient is experiencing renal failure and has been treated for acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Renal recommendations will guide further management.

Sedation is currently managed with fentanyl boluses and patches, and clonazepam has been started for anxiety. The patient previously had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, but now appears to be in normal sinus rhythm. Metop"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease now with respiratory failure and worsening renal failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure, currently with trach and peg: CT
   suggestive of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] vs ARDS. Likely cause of failure to wean is poor lung
   function. 75% of lung is dead space.
   - Cont albuerol and ipratroprium
   - attempt PSV trial today
 trach collar if tolerates
   - ABG q12h, adjust vent as needed
   # Resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas: [**Last Name (un) 206**] to tobra/gent only. Loaded
   tobra 180mg post HD friday, plan to check tobra level monday AM prior
   to HD, if level > 2.5, then 100 mg post HD monday, if <2.5 then 120mg
   post HD monday(per pharmacy). All other antibiotics stopped.
   -check Tobra level
 redose tonight.
   -cont Tobra, D1= [**9-4**], day [**2090-7-18**] days (per ID)
   #Funguria
   - Cont fluconazole because PARAPSILOSIS more sensitive to fluconazole
   and its more concentrated in urine. Day [**1-18**] (day 1 [**8-29**])
   - Urology does not want to do cystoscopy at this time.
   - d/c bladder irrigation/washings - finshined amphotericin bladder
   irrigation 3 days ago
   - Urine cultures negative
   #Renal Failure: Treated for AIN
   - renal to recommended either HD or UF, wait renal recs for plan.
   - renal has no plan for HD today, follow renals recs
   #Thrombocytopenia: Decreased over last week, stable from yesterday,
   coags stable
   - continue to monitor
   - if continue to drop consider HIT
   #Sedation: Currently requiring 100microgram boluses of fentanyl q1hr as
   well as increased fentanyl to 200 microgram patchyesterday
   -D/C fentanyl drip, increase fentanyl patch, give fentanyl bolus for
   sedation/pain control
   -started standing clonazepam for anxiety
   -ABGs as above
    # Afib w/ RVR: appears in NSR now
   -Metoprolol to 25 mg TID for rate control
   # Anemia: Pt has h/o of bleeding from trach site and had
   retroperitoneal bleeding and bleeding from foley. Must weigh bleeding
   vs. PE given h/o dvt. HCT currently stable
    -check Q12. goal HCT > 28
    # Hx of Chronic DVT
 U/S did not show DVT, no bump in INR from
   yesterday to today
   - increase coumadin to 7.5 mg NG daily, follow INR
   - continue heparin drip until INR therapeutic
   - Check INR, PT, PTT this AM
   # Pneumomediastinum/sq emphysema
 decreased from yesterday
   - continue to follow CXR
   # Hypotension:
   -off pressors, goal MAP >60
   # Skin breakdown
   -wound care consult for trach site ulceration and right buttocks wounds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease who is currently in respiratory failure and has worsening renal function. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and has been diagnosed with resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas infection. The patient also has funguria and is being treated for paraplegia with fluconazole. The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable, and they require sedation and pain control with fentanyl. The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response has resolved, and they are being managed for rate control. The patient has a history of chronic deep vein thrombosis and anemia, and they are being monitored closely. The patient has pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, which has improved from yesterday. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and they are being weaned off pressors. The patient has skin breakdown at the tracheostomy site and right buttocks wounds, for which a wound care consult has been requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure, along with the presence of a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation, indicates a potential complication related to the patient's underlying lung disease.
2. Worsening renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, leading to concerns about acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination.

2. Pseudomonas Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for resistant pulmonary pseudomonas infection. If not properly managed, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure or recurrence of the infection.

3. Funguria: The presence of fungal infection in the urine requires ongoing treatment with fluconazole to prevent the spread of infection.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, which may lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating a potential risk for bleeding complications.

6. Coagulation Disorder: The patient's INR is at 2.0, indicating a risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.

7. Anemia: The patient has a history of bleeding from various sites, including tracheostomy and Foley catheter insertion. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and considering transfusions if necessary is crucial.

8. History of Chronic DVT: Although the current ultrasound did not show any deep vein thromb"

   - renal has no plan for HD today, thinks kidneys are starting to
   recover
   - Get renal plan for catheter
   # Coagulation: INR at 2.0
   - Follow to make sure at goal
   - continue warfarin
   - stop heparin
   #Thrombocytopenia: Decreased over last week, Down to 103. Unknown
   etiology, unlikely HIT due to timing and lack of thrombosis
   - PM platelets
   - D/C heparin - INR at goal
   # G-tube erosion
   - Surgery to come place vertical spacer
   #Funguria
   - Cont fluconazole because PARAPSILOSIS more sensitive to fluconazole
   and its more concentrated in urine. Day 13/14 (day 1 [**8-29**])
   - Urology does not want to do cystoscopy at this time.
   - d/c bladder irrigation/washings - finshined amphotericin bladder
   irrigation 4 days ago
   - Urine cultures negative
   #Sedation/Pain control: Improved, not apneic, only required more during
   dressing changes
   - cont fentanyl patch, bolus and methodone
   -started standing clonazepam for anxiety
    # Afib w/ RVR: appears in NSR now
   - Metoprolol to 25 mg TID for rate control
   # Anemia: Pt has h/o of bleeding from trach site and had
   retroperitoneal bleeding and bleeding from foley. Must weigh bleeding
   vs. PE given h/o dvt. HCT currently stable
    - check Q12. goal HCT > 28
    # Hx of Chronic DVT
 U/S did not show DVT, no bump in INR from
   yesterday to today
   - increase coumadin to 7.5 mg NG daily, follow INR
   - d/c heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, currently experiencing respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. The patient has been switched back to assist-control ventilation due to increasing pCO2 levels. A thoracic surgery evaluation revealed a G-tube ulcer, and sutures were added with plans for a vertical spacer. The patient's brother was unable to attend a meeting. Renal and ID teams are discussing the duration of pseudomonas treatment, estimated at 14 days. The patient's dialysis catheter was stopped and then restarted. No known drug allergies are reported. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin, Coumadin (warfarin), pantoprazole (Protonix), and fentanyl. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F) and 35.4°C (95.8°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/52 mmHg to 152/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight is currently 155 kg, with a height of 74 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,619 mL and output of 1,310 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 35%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.23, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 69 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 234. Other lab values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine, lactate, and D-dimer levels, along with decreased platelet count and albumin level. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure with tracheostomy and G-tube in place. The patient is likely experiencing type II respiratory failure due to poor lung function, with 75% of the lung being dead space.
- Continue albuerol and ipratroprium nebulizations.
- Attempt pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial today.
- Obtain ABG every 12 hours and adjust ventilator settings as needed.

2. Resistant pulmonary pseudomonas infection treated with tobramycin/gentamicin. The patient received a loading dose of tobramycin last night. Check drug levels on Friday, and administer 100 mg post hemodialysis if levels exceed 2.5, or 120 mg post hemodialysis if levels are below 2.5. All other antibiotics have been discontinued.

3. Renal failure treated for acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), with rising creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease now with respiratory failure and worsening renal failure.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   # Hypoxemic Hypercarbic respiratory failure. Trach and G-tube. CT
   suggestive of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] or ARDS. Likely cause of failure to wean is poor lung
   function. 75% of lung is dead space.
   - Cont albuerol and ipratroprium
   - attempt PSV trial today
   - ABG q12h, adjust vent as needed
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   # Resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas: [**Last Name (un) 206**] to tobra/gent only. Loaded with
   tobra last PM. Check levels Friday, if level > 2.5, then 100 mg post
   HD, if <2.5 then 120mg post HD. All other antibiotics stopped.
   -Cont Tobra (got 120mg  IV last PM)
   - Day 7/14d course per ID
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   #Renal Failure: Treated for AIN, Cr rising, UOP ~600 yesterday, and
   ~400 this AM.  No HD yesterday.
   - F/U renal recs for ?HD
   - verify plan to remove HD catheter before d/c home
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   # Trach, Decub, and G-tube sites
   - wound care consult for trach site ulceration and right buttocks
   wounds
   - thoracics following G-tube erosion, will place vertical spacer
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   #Funguria
   - Cont fluconazole because PARAPSILOSIS more sensitive to fluconazole
   and its more concentrated in urine. Day 14/14 (day 1 [**8-29**])
   - Urology does not want to do cystoscopy at this time.
   - Urine cultures negative.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
   #Thrombocytopenia: Decreased over last week, Down to 109. Unknown
   etiology, unlikely HIT due to timing and lack of thrombosis
   - platelets # stable this AM from yesterday
   - D/C heparin - INR at goal
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   #Sedation/Pain control:  only required bolus during dressing changes
   - cont fentanyl patch, bolus and methodone
   -standing clonazepam for anxiety
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - Metoprolol to 25 mg TID for rate control
   - continue warfarin w/ goal INR 2.0
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
   -continue bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease now presenting with respiratory failure and worsening renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be caused by poor lung function.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by resistant pulmonary Pseudomonas.
3. Acute renal failure, possibly due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).
4. Impaired skin integrity at tracheostomy, decubitus, and gastrostomy tube sites.
5. Funguria caused by Parapsilosis.
6. Acute thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology.
7. Pain control issues related to acute and chronic pain.
8. Atrial fibrillation requiring rate control.
9. Constipation.

These potential complications need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately to ensure the patient's well-being."
