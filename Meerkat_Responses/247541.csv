   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   60-year-old man with amyloid cardiomyopathy, diastolic and systolic CHF
   (EF 20% [**2159-11-12**]) and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, s/p bortezimib
   and dexamethasone, presented with CHF flare in the setting of fluid
   retention [**1-14**] chemotx.
   .
   #. Dyspnea/Pump: severe restrictive cardiomyopathy from amyloidosis.
   Very poor prognosis. S/p right heart cath [**2158-12-16**], which showed improved
   CI on milrinone trial. Now to CCU on milrinone gtt and furosemide gtt.
   - continue milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   - continue furosemide 10 mg/hr
   - check cardiac index in 1 hour
   - monitor PA closely; if elevated, will consider decreasing milrinone
   - continue metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **]; goal HR in the 60s
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   #. CAD: no known CAD & recent cath with clean coronaries. troponin
   elevated in setting of CRI. no changes on EKG, tele.
   - continue metoprolol
   - holding statins and aspirin due to concern about liver and platelet
   toxicity while gettting chemotx.
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL opacity on CXR on [**2158-12-14**].
   - levoflox 750 mg x 5 days
   .
   # Multiple myeloma: followed by heme/onc. received chemotx [**2159-12-14**] with
   reduced dose of decadron
   - f/u BMT recs
   - continue allopurinol
   - fluconazole started for thrush.
   .
   # Psych - depression/adjustment disorder [**1-14**] medical illness. very flat
   affect.
   - cont citalopram 20
   - sw consult and palliative care consult appreciated
   .
   #. Elevated Cr: Cr 2.2, unclear baseline (? 1.4). Likely from prenal
   azotemia secondary to heart failure as well as concurrent furosemide
   therapy.
   - follow renal labs closely
   - will renally dose medications.
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Na 127, up from 122. Has been in low 120s during this
   admission. Most likely from ongoing diuresis.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]; monitor mental status
   - continue diuretics for now

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of amyloid cardiomyopathy, diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. He presented with CHF flare in the setting of fluid retention related to chemotherapy. He has been admitted to the ICU post cardiac catheterization on milrinone and Lasix gtt. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 106/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature within normal range. 

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, blood glucose, calcium, and phosphorus. The assessment and plan indicate heart failure, multiple myeloma, ineffective coping, and other medical conditions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and infections. The patient is at high risk for these complications due to his underlying conditions and ongoing treatment. Close monitoring of his vital signs, cardiac function, renal function, electrolytes, and infection status will be necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with amyloid cardiomyopathy, diastolic and systolic heart failure, and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. He presented with a CHF flare in the setting of fluid retention after completing chemotherapy. The patient has severe restrictive cardiomyopathy from amyloidosis, resulting in a very poor prognosis. He is currently in the ICU for monitored diuresis with milrinone and furosemide support. His vital signs are stable, but he reports weakness and muscle soreness. The patient has a history of allergies to lisinopril and is on several medications including levofloxacin, fluconazole, citalopram, and allopurinol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has severe restrictive cardiomyopathy due to amyloidosis, which can lead to further deterioration of heart function and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of respiratory failure or infection.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may progress to renal failure if not managed properly.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia and should be monitored closely for any changes in electrolyte levels, as imbalances can affect heart rhythm and overall health.
5. Infection"
