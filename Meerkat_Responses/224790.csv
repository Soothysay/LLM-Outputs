   63 y/o F with hx of severe COPD, IgA immunedeficiency and CAD who
   presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare.

   # Dyspnea: most likely secondary to COPD flare as she recently came off
   steroids.  Stable on nasal canula with nebs.  Did not tolerate cpap
   when she got to the floor.  VBGs improving.
   - O2 NC with goal O2 sats 90-95
   - solumedrol IV 125 mg q8hrs, cont for one more day prior to switching
   to PO
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hrs
 tachycardia has
   improved
   - continue azithromycin, if spike would cover for HAP
   - blood cx, sputum cx
 sputum GS with only oral flora
   - monitor today, and if needed, consider bipap
   - echo in AM as pt having worsening symptoms without clear pulmonary
   infection
   .
   # CAD / ST depressions: EKG with new ST depressions, asymptomatic,
   likely rate related, EKG normalized
   - cardiac enzymes were negative
   - ASA, statin, plavix; no BB due to COPD
   .
   # Tachycardia: sinus tach, chronic as is tachycardic in all prior
   discharge summaries.  Probably multifactorial secondary to respiratory
   distress, pain, dehydration.  No evidence of R heart strain, but if
   does not improve, consider PE workup.
   - xopenex instead of albuterol
   - telemetry
   - received 250 cc bolus, would keep on drier side, though, because of
   pulm function, apparently has low UOP at baseline
   .
   # Abd pain: chronic, no change in symptoms, unclear etiology.
   - pain control as below
   - cont ranitidine
   .
   # IgA Deficiency: has known immunedeficiency.  If clinically worsens,
   would broaden abx to HAP coverage.
   .
   # Cachexia: chronic, has lost significant amount of weight in past year
   secondary to poor PO intake.  Outpatient malignancy workup has been
   negative.
   - advance diet, including ensures
   .
   # Depression: stable, no changes in mood
   - continue outpatient nortriptyline and paroxetine
   .
   # Pain Control: from kyphotic fractures, is on chronic opioids at home
   and in conjunction with her PCP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, IgA immunodeficiency, and CAD. She presents with worsening dyspnea consistent with a COPD flare. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several conditions.

1. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is most likely secondary to a COPD flare. She is stable on a nasal cannula with nebs (nebulizer treatments). The goal oxygen saturation is 90-95%. The plan includes continuing O2 NC, solumedrol IV, insulin sliding scale while on steroids, xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hours, azithromycin, and monitoring for HAP. If needed, bipap may be considered, and an echo will be done in the morning.

2. CAD/ST depressions: The patient has new ST depressions on the EKG, but she is asymptomatic, and it is likely rate-related. The cardiac enzymes were negative. The plan includes continuing ASA, statin, and Plavix, and no beta-blocker due to COPD.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has chronic sinus tachycardia, which is multifactorial. There is no evidence of right heart strain, but if it does not improve, a PE workup may be considered. The plan includes giving x"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, IgA immunodeficiency, and CAD. She presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare. The patient's dyspnea is likely secondary to the COPD flare, as she recently stopped using steroids. She is stable on a nasal cannula with nebulizers. The goal oxygen saturation is 90-95%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 97 bpm (with a range of 97-123 bpm), blood pressure of 126/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (with a range of 14-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

On physical examination, the patient appears chronically ill but is alert and oriented. She is in acute respiratory distress and using accessory muscles. Her lungs show decreased air movement in all fields, with scant wheezes anteriorly. There are no crackles or rhonchi. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 393 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 172 mg/dL, and potassium of 4.4 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient tolerated overnight with good oxygen saturations using a nasal cannula. The heart rate has decreased from the 120s-130s to around 100. The patient's urine output is low, so their diet has been advanced to clear fluids so they can drink to thirst. No major complaints were reported overnight.

The patient has allergies to tetracyclines and unknown medications. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is on various infusions and ICU medications, as well as other medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 97 bpm with a range of 97-123 bpm, blood pressure of 126/73 mmHg with a range of 122/67-169/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute with a range of 14-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 41.3 kg and was 42 kg upon admission. Fluid balance shows a total input of 400 mL and 300 mL since 12 AM, with a total output of 235 mL and 175 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 250 mL, with other inputs and outputs noted.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device of a nasal cannula and has an SpO2 of 96%. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note. Peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, and neurologic examination are not assessed.

Laboratory results include white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.4%, platelet count (Plt) of 393 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T of <0.01 ng/mL, glucose of 172 mg/dL, and other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and electrolytes.

The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, and the care plan includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status and disposition are also noted."

   steroids.  No increase in sputum, but does have change in color.
   Stable on nasal canula with nebs.  Did not tolerate cpap when she got
   to the floor.  Unable to get ABG.
   - O2 NC with goal O2 sats 90-95
   - solumedrol IV 125 mg q8hrs
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hrs
   - continue azithromycin, if spike would cover for HAP
   - blood cx, sputum cx
   - echo in AM as pt having worsening symptoms without clear pulmonary
   infection

   # CAD / ST depressions: EKG with new ST depressions, asymptomatic,
   likely rate related
   - cycle CEs
   - ASA, statin, plavix; no BB due to COPD
   .
   # Tachycardia: sinus tach, chronic as is tachycardic in all prior
   discharge summaries.  Probably multifactorial secondary to respiratory
   distress, pain, dehydration.  No evidence of R heart strain, but if
   does not improve, consider PE workup.
   - xopenex instead of albuterol
   - telemetry
   - had been on diltiazem in the past, consider restarting if heart rate
   remains high
   .
   # Abd pain: chronic, no change in symptoms, unclear etiology.
   - pain control as below
   - cont ranitidine
   .
   # IgA Deficiency: has known immunedeficiency.  If clinically worsens,
   would broaden abx to HAP coverage.
   .
   # Cachexia: chronic, has lost significant amount of weight in past year
   secondary to poor PO intake.  Outpatient malignancy workup has been
   negative.
   - NPO tonight

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, IgA immunodeficiency, and CAD who presents with worsening dyspnea consistent with a COPD flare. The patient is currently on nasal cannula with nebs, solumedrol IV, insulin sliding scale while on steroids, xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hours, and azithromycin. Blood cultures and sputum cultures have been obtained. An echo is planned in the morning as the patient is experiencing worsening symptoms without clear pulmonary infection.

The patient also has CAD with new ST depressions on EKG, but she is asymptomatic and it is likely rate-related. She will continue on cycle CEs, ASA, statin, and Plavix. Beta-blockers are not given due to COPD. The patient has a history of tachycardia, which is chronic and multifactorial. If her heart rate does not improve, a PE workup may be considered. She has been switched from albuterol to xopenex.

The patient also has chronic abdominal pain with unclear etiology. Pain control measures are ongoing. She has known IgA deficiency and her condition may worsen, so broadening antibiotic coverage to HAP is considered. She also has cachexia, likely secondary to poor PO intake and chronic weight loss. An outpatient malignancy workup has been negative. She is NPO"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F with hx of severe COPD, IgA immunedeficiency and CAD who
   presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare.
   .
   # Dyspnea: most likely secondary to COPD flare as she recently came off
   steroids.  Stable on nasal canula with nebs.  Did not tolerate cpap
   when she got to the floor.  VBGs improving.
   - O2 NC with goal O2 sats 90-95
   - solumedrol IV 125 mg q8hrs, cont for one more day prior to switching
   to PO
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hrs
 tachycardia has
   improved
   - continue azithromycin, if spike would cover for HAP
   - blood cx, sputum cx
 sputum GS with only oral flora
   - echo in AM as pt having worsening symptoms without clear pulmonary
   infection
   .
   # CAD / ST depressions: EKG with new ST depressions, asymptomatic,
   likely rate related, EKG normalized
   - cardiac enzymes were negative
   - ASA, statin, plavix; no BB due to COPD
   .
   # Tachycardia: sinus tach, chronic as is tachycardic in all prior
   discharge summaries.  Probably multifactorial secondary to respiratory
   distress, pain, dehydration.  No evidence of R heart strain, but if
   does not improve, consider PE workup.
   - xopenex instead of albuterol
   - telemetry
   - received 250 cc bolus, would keep on drier side, though, because of
   pulm function
   .
   # Abd pain: chronic, no change in symptoms, unclear etiology.
   - pain control as below
   - cont ranitidine
   .
   # IgA Deficiency: has known immunedeficiency.  If clinically worsens,
   would broaden abx to HAP coverage.
   .
   # Cachexia: chronic, has lost significant amount of weight in past year
   secondary to poor PO intake.  Outpatient malignancy workup has been
   negative.
   - NPO tonight
   - encourage PO with supplements when diet is started
   .
   # Depression: stable, no changes in mood
   - continue outpatient nortriptyline and paroxetine
   .
   # Pain Control: from kyphotic fractures, is on chronic opioids at home
   and in conjunction with her PCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, IgA immunodeficiency, and CAD. She presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare. She is currently on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and nebulizers. Her vital signs show tachycardia, which has improved, and she is in acute respiratory distress using accessory muscles. Physical examination reveals decreased air movement in all lung fields, scant wheezes anteriorly, and no crackles or rhonchi. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, suggestive of an infection. The patient's troponin T level is below the detection limit, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. Assessment and plan include treatment for dyspnea secondary to COPD flare, improvement of oxygen saturation, continuation of antibiotics, blood culture, and sputum culture. The patient also has cardiac issues, abdominal pain, IgA deficiency, cachexia, depression, and chronic pain, for which appropriate management plans have been made.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged or severe respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure.
2. Infection due to COPD flare or immunodeficiency.
3. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Abdominal pain and tenderness could indicate an underlying abdominal pathology such as diverticulitis or perforation.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 3648**]
s note above and
   agree with her findings and plan of care.  Mrs [**Known lastname 414**] is well known to
   me and she has very severe steroid responsive COPD with an IGA
   deficiency that predisposes her to infections.  She has severe kyphosis
   from osteoporosis which further increases her work of breathing, and
   has lost much weight and undoubtedly has decreased muscle strength,
   including of her resp muscles.
   In the setting of tapering off steroids the pt had to stop her inhaled
   steroids due to lack of insurance coverage.  In this setting she noted
   increased SOB and was admitted.  She has improved with solumedrol, RTC
   nebs, and Azithro, but is still wheezing today.  Though no clear
   evidence of pneumonia, I agree with continuing antibiotics.
   I have long thought that she should not be totally tapered off po
   steroids and would suggest that a chronic dose of 5-10mg daily might
   prevent COPD flares and hospitalizations.   This would also protect her
   from times when she can
t afford her inhaled steroids (donut hole
   medicare part D).  Additionally one could Rx her with Pulmicort
   Respules .25 - .5mg [**Hospital1 **] via nebulzer, which I think regular Medicare
   will cover all year long.
   She also needs aggressive attention to reversing wt loss, including RTC

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, CAD, osteoporosis, and IgA deficiency. She recently completed a steroid taper and presented with increased shortness of breath. The patient also complains of chronic abdominal pain and has lost 40 pounds in the past year. In the ICU, she was placed on nasal CPAP, desaturated to the 70s, and then placed on NC (not clear what NC stands for) and improved. She was started on solumedrol and azithromycin. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to a COPD flare. She is receiving solumedrol, xopenex, and nasal BiPAP support.
2. Osteoporosis: The patient has severe kyphosis from osteoporosis, which increases her work of breathing. There is also a mention of weight loss and decreased muscle strength, which can further contribute to respiratory complications.
3. Infections: The patient has an IgA deficiency, which predisposes her to infections. She is currently on antibiotics for an unknown infection.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD (coronary artery disease), which may increase the risk of cardiac complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), osteoporosis, and IgA deficiency. She has recently completed a steroid taper and is experiencing increased shortness of breath. The patient also complains of chronic abdominal pain and has lost significant weight over the past year.

The patient is tachypneic in the 30s and requires nasal CPAP to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. An attempt to obtain an arterial blood gas (ABG) was unsuccessful, but a venous blood gas (VBG) reveals a pH of 7.34/64. The patient experienced desaturation to the 70s overnight and was placed back on nasal CPAP, followed by noninvasive ventilation via a nasal bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) device.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate between 108-123 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/66-169/105 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has decreased from 42 kg to 41.3 kg.

Fluid balance reveals an intake of 400 mL and output of 235 mL over 24 hours. The patient is receiving multiple medications including steroids, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. She has"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F with hx of severe COPD, IgA immunedeficiency and CAD who
   presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare.
   .
   # Dyspnea: most likely secondary to COPD flare as she recently came off
   steroids.  Stable on nasal canula with nebs.  Did not require CPAP or
   BIPAP over 24 hours.
   - O2 NC with goal O2 sats 90-95
   - switch IV steroids to oral steroids today
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hours
   - continue azithromycin
   - blood cx, sputum cx
   - echo in AM as pt having worsening symptoms without clear pulmonary
   infection
   .
   # CAD / ST depressions: EKG with new ST depressions, asymptomatic,
   likely rate related, EKG normalized.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.
   - ASA, statin, plavix; no BB due to COPD
   .
   # Tachycardia: sinus tachycardia has been noted in all prior discharge
   summaries.  Probably multifactorial secondary to respiratory distress,
   pain, dehydration.  No evidence of R heart strain, but if does not
   improve, consider PE workup.
   - xopenex instead of albuterol
   - telemetry
   .
   # Abd pain: chronic, no change in symptoms, unclear etiology.
   - pain control as below
   - cont ranitidine
   .
   # IgA Deficiency: has known immunedeficiency.  If clinically worsens,
   would broaden abx to HAP coverage.
   .
   # Cachexia: chronic, has lost significant amount of weight in past year
   secondary to poor PO intake.  Outpatient malignancy workup has been
   negative.  Suspect this is related to worsening COPD.
   - advance diet, including ensures
   .
   # Depression: stable, no changes in mood
   - continue outpatient nortriptyline and paroxetine
   .
   # Pain Control: from kyphotic fractures, is on chronic opioids at home
   and in conjunction with her PCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea. She has a history of chronic pain and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Her vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing difficulty breathing. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating possible infection or inflammation. There are no significant abnormalities in her other lab values. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and poor air entry in the respiratory system, suggesting a possible respiratory problem. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and decreased breath sounds indicate a potential respiratory failure. Immediate intervention may be required to support her breathing and prevent further deterioration.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels suggest the possibility of an infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic treatment if necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium, there is a risk of developing DVT. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT, such as leg pain or swelling, is crucial.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is necessary, especially considering"

   63 y/o F with hx of severe COPD, IgA immunedeficiency and CAD who
   presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare.  ICU
   course complicated by A. fib with RVR today requiring cardioversion.
   .
   # Dyspnea: most likely secondary to COPD flare as she recently came off
   steroids.  Stable on nasal canula with nebs.  Did not require CPAP or
   BIPAP over 24 hours.
   - O2 NC with goal O2 sats 90-95
   - continue IV steroids given episode of respiratory distress today
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hours
   - continue azithromycin
   - blood cx, sputum cx
   - echo in AM as pt having worsening symptoms without clear pulmonary
   infection
   .
   # A fib with RVR.  Had been in sinus tachycardia during MICU stay but
   had episode of A. fib with RVR to 180s today associated with SOB.  She
   was given adenosine 6 mg iv x 1 with out cardioversion and it was clear
   she was in an irregular rhythm.  She was given dilt 10 mg IV x 2.  She
   was cardioverted with conversion to NSR.  Trigger for A. fib with RVR
   was not clear as patient was not in pain, dehydrated, or in respiratory
   distress.
   - xopenex instead of albuterol
   - telemetry
   - initiate metoprolol for improved rate control though currently in
   sinus
   .
   # CAD / ST depressions: EKG with new ST depressions, asymptomatic,
   likely rate related, EKG normalized.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.
   - ASA, statin, plavix; no BB due to COPD
   .
   .
   # Abd pain: chronic, no change in symptoms, unclear etiology.
   - pain control as below
   - cont ranitidine
   .
   # IgA Deficiency: has known immunedeficiency.  If clinically worsens,
   would broaden abx to HAP coverage.
   .
   # Cachexia: chronic, has lost significant amount of weight in past year
   secondary to poor PO intake.  Outpatient malignancy workup has been
   negative.  Suspect this is related to worsening COPD.
   - advance diet, including ensures
   .
   # Depression: stable, no changes in mood
   - continue outpatient nortriptyline and paroxetine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, IgA immunodeficiency, and CAD. She presented with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare. The ICU course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) today, requiring cardioversion. The patient's dyspnea is most likely secondary to a COPD flare as she recently came off steroids. She is stable on nasal cannula with nebs and did not require CPAP or BIPAP over the past 24 hours. The plan includes continuing IV steroids, insulin sliding scale while on steroids, xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hours, and continuing azithromycin. Blood cultures and sputum cultures have been ordered. An echo has been ordered in the morning as the patient is having worsening symptoms without clear pulmonary infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's worsening dyspnea indicates a COPD flare, which can lead to respiratory distress. Monitoring oxygen saturation and providing necessary respiratory support, such as nebulizers and bronchodilators, is crucial.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR, requiring cardioversion. Close monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and rate control is important to prevent further episodes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe COPD and mitral regurgitation who was admitted on [**6-28**] for hypoxemic respiratory distress. She experienced an episode of SVT with a heart rate of 180 beats per minute and blood pressure of 160s. She received 6mg of adenosine IV, which converted her to atrial fibrillation. Following the adenosine, she went into hypoxic respiratory distress with oxygen saturation levels in the 70s on room air. Bag-mask ventilation was provided temporarily, followed by a propofol bolus and synchronized cardioversion at 200J. She was also given diltiazem 10mg IV x2. Currently, she is in sinus rhythm on a venti mask.

The patient has allergies to tetracyclines and unknown others. She has been receiving various medications including Singulair, Solu-Medrol, azithromycin, nortriptyline, Paxil, ranitidine, simvastatin, RISS, fentanyl patch, ASA, and Plavix. She has been on prophylactic heparin sodium since [**2206-6-30**] 04:00 AM.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 99.2 to 98 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 92-116"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe COPD and mitral regurgitation admitted for hypoxemic respiratory distress. She experienced an episode of SVT with a heart rate of 180 and blood pressure of 160s, which was treated with 6mg adenosine IV. Following the adenosine, the patient went into hypoxic respiratory distress with oxygen saturation levels in the 70s on RA. The patient then received propofol bolus and synchronized cardioversion at 200J, resulting in conversion to sinus rhythm. The patient is currently on a vent mask and shows signs of improved oxygenation with a saturation level of 93%. 

The patient has allergies to tetracyclines and unknown allergens. She is on multiple medications including Singulair, Solu-Medrol, azithromycin, nortriptyline, Paxil, ranitidine, simvastatin, RISS, fentanyl patch, ASA, and Plavix. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin sodium.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events described above. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.3C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 132/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is in sinus tachycardia rhythm.

   Echo. [**2206-6-30**].
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
   basal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the mid-segment. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). The aortic valve leaflets
   (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
   no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
   is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation most
   likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F with hx of severe COPD, IgA immunedeficiency and CAD who
   presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare.  ICU
   course complicated by A. fib with RVR today requiring cardioversion.
   .
   # Dyspnea: most likely secondary to COPD flare as she recently came off
   steroids.  Stable on nasal canula with nebs.  Did not require CPAP or
   BIPAP over 24 hours.
   - O2 NC with goal O2 sats 90-95
   - change IV steroids to PO
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hours
   - continue azithromycin
   - blood cx, sputum cx
   - echo in AM as pt having worsening symptoms without clear pulmonary
   infection
   .
   # A fib with RVR.  Had been in sinus tachycardia during MICU stay but
   had episode of A. fib with RVR to 180s today associated with SOB.  She
   was given adenosine 6 mg iv x 1 with out cardioversion and it was clear
   she was in an irregular rhythm.  She was given dilt 10 mg IV x 2.  She
   was cardioverted with conversion to NSR.  Trigger for A. fib with RVR
   was not clear as patient was not in pain, dehydrated, or in respiratory
   distress.
   - xopenex instead of albuterol
   - telemetry
   - initiate metoprolol for improved rate control though currently in
   sinus
   .
   # CAD / ST depressions: EKG with new ST depressions, asymptomatic,
   likely rate related, EKG normalized.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.
   - ASA, statin, plavix; no BB due to COPD
   .
   .
   # Abd pain: chronic, no change in symptoms, unclear etiology.
   - pain control as below
   - cont ranitidine
   .
   # IgA Deficiency: has known immunedeficiency.  If clinically worsens,
   would broaden abx to HAP coverage.
   .
   # Cachexia: chronic, has lost significant amount of weight in past year
   secondary to poor PO intake.  Outpatient malignancy workup has been
   negative.  Suspect this is related to worsening COPD.
   - advance diet, including ensures
   .
   # Depression: stable, no changes in mood
   - continue outpatient nortriptyline and paroxetine

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, IgA immunodeficiency, and CAD.
- She presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare.
- The patient's ICU course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which required cardioversion.
- Other medical conditions include chronic abdominal pain, cachexia, depression, and pain control issues.
- The patient is currently stable on a nasal cannula with nebulizers and has not required non-invasive ventilation.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin T levels, but other lab values are within normal range.
- An echocardiogram reveals mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's worsening dyspnea and history of severe COPD suggest that she may experience further exacerbations of her respiratory condition.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and recent episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR. There is also evidence of mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation on the echocardiogram. These findings indicate potential cardiac complications such as heart failure or"

   Echo. [**2206-6-30**].
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
   basal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the mid-segment. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). The aortic valve leaflets
   (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
   no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
   is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation most
   likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F with hx of severe COPD, IgA immunedeficiency and CAD who
   presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare.  ICU
   course complicated by A. fib with RVR today requiring cardioversion but
   has been in sinus for 24 hours now.

   # Dyspnea: most likely secondary to COPD flare as she recently came off
   steroids.  Stable on nasal canula with nebs.  Did not require CPAP or
   BIPAP over 48  hours.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have had A. fib with RVR prior to
   arrival at hospital which might have contributed to respiratory
   distress.  Echo failed to demonstrate significant worsening which might
   have contributed to dyspnea.
   - O2 NC with goal O2 sats 90-95
   - change IV steroids to PO prednisone
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - xopenex nebs q4 (q2 PRN), ipratropium q6 hours

   # A fib with RVR.  Had been in sinus tachycardia during MICU stay but
   had episode of A. fib with RVR to 180s today associated with SOB.  She
   was given adenosine 6 mg iv x 1 with out cardioversion and it was clear
   she was in an irregular rhythm.  She was given dilt 10 mg IV x 2.  She
   was cardioverted with conversion to NSR.  Trigger for A. fib with RVR
   was not clear as patient was not in pain, dehydrated, or in respiratory
   distress.
   - xopenex instead of albuterol
   - telemetry

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, IgA immunodeficiency, and coronary artery disease. She presented with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD flare. During her ICU stay, she experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A. fib with RVR), which required cardioversion but has been in sinus rhythm for the past 24 hours.

Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is most likely secondary to a COPD flare. She has been stable on nasal cannula with nebs and did not require CPAP or BIPAP over 48 hours. However, she had a previous episode of A. fib with RVR that might have contributed to respiratory distress.
2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient had an episode of A. fib with RVR today associated with SOB. She was given adenosine and diltiazem, and subsequently cardioverted into sinus rhythm. The trigger for A. fib with RVR was not clear.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and her EKG showed new ST depressions, which were likely rate-related. Cardiac enzymes were negative, indicating no myocardial infarction. She is on statin and Plavix but not on aspirin due to her history of perforated duodenal ulcer and gastritis.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient has chronic abdominal pain with unclear etiology. Pain control measures are in place.
5. IgA deficiency: The patient has known immunodeficiency, and her condition may worsen if she develops an infection. Broadening antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pathogens may be necessary.
6. Cachexia: The patient has significant weight loss due to poor oral intake, possibly related to worsening COPD. Nutritional support is recommended.
7. Depression: The patient's depression is stable, and she is on outpatient nortriptyline and paroxetine.
8. Pain control: The patient requires chronic opioids for pain management related to kyphotic fractures. She is on a fentanyl patch and percocet PRN.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD symptoms leading to respiratory distress, recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR, further cardiac complications related to CAD, gastrointestinal issues due to previous perforated duodenal ulcer and gastritis, and infections due to IgA deficiency."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented to the ICU with complaints of shortness of breath (dyspnea). Upon admission, the patient was found to be in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with rapid ventricular response. Adenosine was administered, followed by sedation and cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. The patient was also started on diltiazem.

An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50%, with slight left ventricular dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation. Thyroid function tests revealed low TSH and normal free T4 levels.

The patient has a history of chronic pain and impaired skin integrity. Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate ranging from 79-177 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120-140/63-79 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

Fluid balance has shown an intake of 650 mL and output of 665 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 15 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support, with SpO2 at 99% and an ABG result of ///31/. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds but poor respiratory effort. Neurologic assessment is incomplete due to the"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 63F very severe COPD p/w respiratory distress
   in the setting of hypertension and MR. She has been in NSR since
   synchronized DCCV yesterday.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.8 BP 130/70 HR 80 RR 18-24 with sat 96 on 3LNC.
   Cachectic woman, mild resp distress on 3LNC. Distant BS B. Irreg s1s2.
   Soft +BS. No edema. Labs notable for WBC 17K, HCT 29, K+ 4.1, HCO3 31,
   Cr 0.7. CXR with hyperinflation.
   Agree with plan to manage PAF c RVR with dilt, currently in NSR,
   holding heparin but continuing plavix. Will attempt to clarify
   contraindications to ASA (?ulcer) given hx of CAD / stents. Will
   transition to PO steroids, continue azithro x total of 5 days, and
   transition from nebs to MDI rx for COPD flare. Will check BNP to
   exclude an element of volume overload contributing to her respiratory
   distress, but will hold off on diuresis for now. Abdominal pain is
   baseline, continue fentanyl. She would benefit from pulmonary rehab,
   will begin screening process today. Will add adenosine to allergy list.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Total time: 35 min
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with a COPD flare. She developed supraventricular tachycardia versus atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was cardioverted. The patient has been stable overnight and is currently on diltiazem. She has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Her current medications include atrovent, solumedrol 125 q8, colace, senna, ranitidine, parox, simva, nortip, plavix, singulair, humalog, azithro, fent td, dilt, and levalbuterol. The patient is also receiving propofol for sedation. She has been diagnosed with total body pains, cachexia, and possible stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's severe COPD and recent COPD flare put her at risk for continued respiratory distress. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and continued management of her COPD with bronchodilators and corticosteroids will be important.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response indicate a risk for cardiac complications. Monitoring her heart rhythm and blood pressure, as well as continuing antiarrhythmic medication (diltiazem) and anticoagulation therapy ("
