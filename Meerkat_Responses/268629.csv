","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 25-30%), atrial fibrillation, and previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presents with lower extremity edema after multiple prior admissions and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) after becoming hypotensive and experiencing confusion with intravenous (IV) Lasix boluses.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius (96.6 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/49 to 111/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced.

On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented x3 with appropriate mood and affect. His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT) examination is normal with pink conjunctiva and no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The patient's neck is supple with an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). Cardiac examination reveals a displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI) without murmurs, murmurs, or gallops appreciated. Lung examination shows bilateral faint end inspiratory crackles at bases. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly (HSM)"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (EF 25-30%), atrial fibrillation, and a previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) pacer. The patient presents with lower extremity edema after multiple prior admissions and was transferred to the CCU due to hypotension and confusion following IV Lasix boluses. The patient is currently receiving Milrinone and Lasix gtt.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/35 mmHg to 127/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general appearance, HEENT, neck, or skin. However, there is a displaced PMI with no murmurs appreciated, bilateral faint end inspiratory crackles at the bases, 2+ edema in the thighs and sacrum, and trace edema in the lower legs.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, BUN, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for low potassium and magnesium levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, atrial fibrillation, and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) pacer. He presents with lower extremity edema after multiple prior admissions and was transferred to the CCU after becoming hypotensive and experiencing confusion with IV Lasix boluses. The patient is currently receiving Milrinone and Lasix gtt. His physical examination reveals a displaced PMI, elevated JVP, bilateral faint end inspiratory crackles at bases, and 2+ edema in thighs and sacrum. His labs show elevated digoxin levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium. The patient has a history of gout, GERD, and CAD.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Digoxin toxicity: The patient's digoxin level is 2.4, which is above the therapeutic range. This can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, visual disturbances, cardiac arrhythmias, and even life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

He presents with lower extremity edema after multiple prior admissions and was transferred to the CCU after becoming hypotensive and experiencing confusion with intravenous Lasix boluses.

The patient has been receiving Milrinone and Lasix continuously. His blood pressure has been stable, ranging from 100-120 mmHg. His digoxin level was elevated at 2.4, and his potassium and magnesium levels were within normal limits. Creatinine was 1.7 mg/dL, which indicates some degree of renal impairment. The patient's urine output has been good, with a total output of 3.9 liters over the past 24 hours.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-oriented, with no chest pain or shortness of breath. He reports dizziness and blurry vision but denies recent episodes of confusion. His lungs are clear, with faint end inspiratory crackles at the bases. There is mild pitting edema in his thighs and sacrum, while his lower legs have trace edema. His pulses are strong and regular.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated glucose levels. His electroly"

He has been on a milrinone drip and lasix gtt, with a goal of achieving a negative fluid balance of over 5 liters. His digoxin loading dose has been completed, and his dig level is at 1.8. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His heart rhythm is ventricular paced. 

The patient's physical examination reveals an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, and pitting edema in the thighs and sacrum. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), while creatinine levels are slightly elevated. 

The patient's plan includes continuing milrinone and lasix gtts for another day, monitoring daily intake and output, daily weight, and maintaining a fluid restriction of 1200 cc. Digoxin will be administered at a dose of 0.125 mg every other day, with a planned check of the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction of 25-30%), and atrial fibrillation who presents with an exacerbation of CHF. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on milrinone and lasix drips. His digoxin level is 1.8, and he is on a reduced dose of digoxin every other day due to renal failure. The patient has completed his digoxin loading and has shown improvement, with a negative fluid balance of almost 7 liters. However, his creatinine level has increased to 2.0 from 1.7, likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion from aggressive diuresis. The plan is to stop the milrinone and lasix drips after confirming with Dr. [First Name (Title)], and start a oral lasix dose once the drips are stopped. The patient's medications will be adjusted accordingly, and he will continue to be monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's current exacerbation of CHF puts him at risk for further complications such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, accumulation of waste products, and increased risk of infection.
3. Gout: The patient has a history of gout, and his current medication regimen includes allopurinol. However, the dose of allopurinol has been reduced due to his renal function. There is a potential risk of gout flare-ups if the allopurinol dose is not appropriately managed.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of CAD increases his risk for future cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's current use of diuretics and digoxin puts him at risk for electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.
6. Infection: Due to the patient's decreased immune function and prolonged hospital stay, he is at an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and decreased venous return from his leg edema. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be implemented.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and optimize his clinical outcomes."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, atrial fibrillation, and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) pacer. He presents with lower extremity edema after multiple prior admissions and is currently being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for CHF exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, jugular venous distention (JVD) elevated to the earlobe, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), regular rhythm with no murmurs, and 1+ pitting edema in the thighs and sacrum. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium.

Assessment and Plan:

1. CHF with both systolic and diastolic failure, ejection fraction of 20%, poor response to preload and afterload changes.
   - The patient is currently on milrinone and lasix infusions.
   - Goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of almost 7 liters.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, atrial fibrillation, and a previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) pacer. He presented with lower extremity edema after multiple prior admissions and was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) after becoming hypotensive and experiencing confusion with intravenous Lasix boluses. The patient is currently receiving milrinone and Lasix drips. His digoxin level is 1.8, and he is on a low dose of digoxin every other day. The patient's fluid balance is negative 6.7 liters over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation with systolic and diastolic failure: The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 25-30%. His current presentation suggests an exacerbation of CHF, which can lead to further fluid accumulation and worsening heart failure symptoms.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, including one episode that required transfer to the CCU. Hypotension can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of renal failure and other systemic complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible acute renal failure, which can be caused by hypotension, medications,"

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, atrial fibrillation, and a previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) pacemaker. He presents with lower extremity edema after multiple prior admissions and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) after becoming hypotensive and experiencing confusion with intravenous (IV) Lasix boluses.

The patient's current medications include Milrinone and Lasix in a drip form. He has completed his digoxin loading and had a digoxin level of 1.8 yesterday, but no dose was given due to renal failure. His daily intake and output are being monitored, along with daily weight and a 1200 fluid restriction. The plan is to stop his Milrinone and Lasix drips after confirming with Dr. [First Name (Title)] as he has reached his goal of almost 7 liters negative and his creatinine (Cr) has started to increase likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion. A discussion will be held about starting a po Lasix dose once his drips are stopped.

The patient's Cr increased to 2.0 from 1.7, likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion from his diuresis. His baseline Cr is in the range of 1.7-1.8, but had been 1.3-1.4 within the last year. Aggressive diuresis will likely be stopped, and monitoring will continue.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is not currently experiencing any symptoms of chest pain. He will continue his home dose of Metoprolol, nitroglycerin (NTG), Simvastatin, and aspirin.

The patient also has a history of gout and currently takes Allopurinol 300 mg daily at home. Given the patient's renal function, the dose was changed to Allopurinol 100 mg daily.

The patient's home dose of ranitidine was decreased due to his decreased renal function to 150 mg daily.

The patient's diet consists of a heart-healthy, low-sodium, 1200 cc fluid restriction diet. His potassium and magnesium levels are replete at >4.0 and >2.0, respectively.

The patient's access includes a peripheral intravenous (PIV) line. His pre-procedural medications include heparin subcutaneously for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Colace and Senna daily for gastrointestinal (GI) issues, and Tylenol as needed for pain.

The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code confirmed with the patient and healthcare proxy."
