   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis and portal
   gastropathy, h/o aspiration who was noted to have vomiting this AM with
   aspiration event and subsequently became hypoxic and tachypneic
   intubation, now also febrile
   #) Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: most likely cause is aspiration given
   witnessed aspiration event.  Other possible causes are PE given RUE DVT
   and not on anticoagulation.  Could be bronchospasm given her COPD,
   especially since there is mild hypercarbia, though likely not the cause
   of her significant hypoxia
   - cont with AC for now, decrease FiO2 to 60%, increase rate to 18 for
   hypercarbia
   - consider A-line
   - sputum/blood cx for ? aspiration PNA
   - start vanco/meropenem for possible aspiration pneumonia while
   awaiting culture data; has h/o zosyn resistant enterobacter in sputum
   previously
   - albuterol/ipratropium inhalers; hold off on steroids for now
   #) Fever: likely in the setting of aspiration with ? pneumonia vs
   pneumonitis.  Could be urinary source, but less likely given time frame
   - blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - vanco/meropenem as above
   - consider stress dose steroids
   #) Ostomy: has significant ostomy output.  Liver service has been
   titrating octreotide/tinctue of opium for adequate control.
   - on octreotide and tincture of opium
   - wound care per recs: miconazole powder
   #) Seizures:
   -continue keppra and phenytoin
   #) Liver failure from Sarcoidosis: s/p TIPS and TIPS revision, most
   recent EGD [**4-20**] w/ esophagitis (on PPI) but no varicies or portal
   gastropathy. No apparent history of SBP. On transplant list. No history
   of cirrhosis.
   - f/u liver recs
   #) F/E/N: had been getting TPN, will hold TPN for now.  Nutrition
   consult to consider tube feeds for improved gut use.  replete lytes PRN
   #) PPx: hep sc, PPI
   #) Access: left PICC

   Present for the key portions of the resident
s history and exam. Agree
   substantially with assessment and plan as outlined during
   multidisciplinary rounds today.  Transferred from medical floor after
   witnessed aspiration, leading to respiratory distress and intubation.

   Respiratory failure in setting of witnessed aspiration.  Tachycardic
   and hypotensive after intubation and through the afternoon has had
   minimal urine output.  We are giving additional fluids, covering with
   abx, dosing meds for renal failure, and cautiously repleting
   electrolytes.  Rechecking differential given progressive eosinophilia
   in recent weeks.  Glu low through afternoon calling into question
   hepatic reserve. We will start an infusion of D10W while awaiting TPN.
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by an aspiration event. She also has a history of aspiration, COPD, and a recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/58 mmHg to 125/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus tachycardia on ECG.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 42, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 6 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, compliance of 30 cmH2O/mL, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 128, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 19 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -4, oxygen consumption (VO2) of 5.8 L/min, and respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute.

The physical examination reveals coarse rhonchi in both lung fields, a soft distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, trace edema, and normal neurologic examination. The laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.0 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 36/64), increased total bilirubin (T Bili: 2.1), decreased albumin (1.6 g/dL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH: 197 IU/L), low calcium (Ca++: 6.4 mg/dL), low magnesium (Mg++: 1.2 mg/dL), and low phosphate (PO4: 2.5 mg/dL).

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hypoxia/respiratory failure, fever, ostomy, seizures, liver failure from sarcoidosis, and full code status. The plan includes intubation and mechanical ventilation, broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia, stress dose steroids, octreotide/tincture of opium for ostomy control, continuation of anti-seizure medications, follow-up with liver recommendations, consideration of arterial line placement, and nutrition consultation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was noted to have vomiting this morning with an aspiration event, subsequently becoming hypoxic and tachypneic. She was intubated and now also febrile. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is most likely due to aspiration, given the witnessed aspiration event. Other possible causes include pulmonary embolism (PE) due to right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and not on anticoagulation, as well as bronchospasm due to COPD. It is important to continue supporting her through the aspiration pneumonia/bacteria and increase ventilation settings if needed.

2. Sepsis/fevers: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis in the setting of aspiration with possible pneumonia vs pneumonitis, as well as bacteremia (PICC line infection). The source of infection could also be urinary, but it is less likely given the time frame. Bacteremia may be transient, contaminant, or true pathogen. Treating it as a true pathogen and continuing vancomycin/meropenem is recommended.

3. Ostomy: The patient has significant ostomy output. Liver service has been titrating octreotide/tincture of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a witnessed aspiration event, leading to respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a rate of 18 breaths per minute. She is also febrile and has a low urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia could be due to aspiration, PE, or bronchospasm. Immediate actions include decreasing FiO2 to 60%, increasing the rate to 18 for hypercarbia, considering the placement of an arterial line, obtaining sputum/blood cultures for aspiration pneumonia, and starting vancomycin/meropenem for possible aspiration pneumonia.
2. Fever: The patient's fever may be related to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. Blood/urine/sputum cultures should be obtained, and vancomycin/meropenem should be continued. Stress dose steroids might be considered.
3. Ostomy: The patient has significant ostomy output, and liver service is titrating octreotide/tincture of opium for adequate control. The patient should continue with octreotide and tincture of opium. Wound care with miconazole powder should also be"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and fever. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. 

Upon admission, the patient was found to have an elevated white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein, indicating a possible infection. The patient also had elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and bilirubin levels, as well as elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactic acid levels. These findings suggest liver dysfunction and potential biliary obstruction.

The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) due to concerns of sepsis secondary to an unknown source. However, the patient's condition worsened, and he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxemia. He has been receiving vasopressor support and has had significant fluid resuscitation. The patient's oxygenation has been maintained with the use of high levels of inspired oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The patient's abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, suggesting ongoing bowel activity. However, the patient has had minimal urine output and is receiving renal support with intravenous fluids.

The patient's neurological status has been altered, with somnolence and inability to follow commands. He is currently sedated and"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. She presented to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. Upon admission, she was found to have hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

The patient's condition has been unstable since admission. She has experienced episodes of hypotension, fever, and low urine output. There have been attempts to wean her off sedation, but she has not been able to maintain extubation. She remains on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.0 K/uL, an elevated heart rate (HR) of 118 bpm, and a blood glucose level of 101 mg/dL. Her electrolytes are relatively stable, but she has an elevated BUN and creatinine level, indicating potential renal impairment. Her liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are mildly elevated, and her total bilirubin is slightly increased.

The patient's daily weight is 66 kg, and she has received a total of 4,506 mL of IV fluids since admission. Her urine output has been low at 10-20 cc/hr. She has"

   56 yo female with hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis and portal
   gastropathy, h/o aspiration who was noted to have vomiting this AM with
   aspiration event and subsequently became hypoxic and tachypneic
   intubation, now also febrile
   #) Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: most likely cause is aspiration given
   witnessed aspiration event.  Other possible causes are PE given RUE DVT
   and not on anticoagulation.  Could be bronchospasm given her COPD,
   especially since there is mild hypercarbia, though likely not the cause
   of her significant hypoxia
   - on PS 5/5 with okay oxygenation and ventilation.  Will support her
   through the aspiration pneumonia/bacteria and increase settings to
   [**11-21**].  RSBI 42 during SBT.
   - sputum/urine cx pending from [**2111-8-17**] (noted to have thick secretions
   [**Name8 (MD) **] RN)
   - on vanco/meropenem day 2 for possible aspiration pneumonia while
   awaiting culture data; has h/o zosyn resistant enterobacter in sputum
   previously
   - albuterol/ipratropium inhalers; hold off on steroids for now
   #) Sepsis/fevers/tachycardia/hypotension: likely in the setting of
   aspiration with ? pneumonia vs pneumonitis as well as bacteremia (PICC
   line infection).  Could be urinary source, but less likely given time
   frame
   - bacteremia may be trangient vs. contaminant vs. true pathogen.  Will
   tx as true pathogen and cont vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**] day 2.
   - will pull PICC line
   - will need better access; consider femoral line since pt has R sided
   clot and L sided PICC line infxn
   - urine/sputum cultures pending
   - vanco/meropenem as above
   - consider stress dose steroids
   #) Ostomy: has significant ostomy output.  Liver service has been
   titrating octreotide/tinctue of opium for adequate control.
   - on octreotide and tincture of opium
   - wound care per recs: miconazole powder
   #) Low UOP
 Cr is stable, oliguric at 20 cc/hr.  Following closely.
   Urine Na is more c/w ATN, rather than hepatorenal syndrome or pre-renal
   disease.  Follow closely.
   #) Seizures:
   -continue keppra and phenytoin
   #) Liver failure from Sarcoidosis: s/p TIPS and TIPS revision, most
   recent EGD [**4-20**] w/ esophagitis (on PPI) but no varicies or portal
   gastropathy. No apparent history of SBP. On transplant list. No history
   of cirrhosis.
   - f/u liver recs
   - hypoglycemia
 started D10 while awaiting TPN.  Okay for now.
   #) F/E/N: had been getting TPN, will hold TPN for now.  Nutrition

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a medical history of hepatic sarcoidosis, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was intubated after experiencing an aspiration event with subsequent hypoxia and tachypnea. The patient is currently febrile and has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. She is on mechanical ventilation and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea suggest respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension may indicate sepsis, possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia or a PICC line infection.
3. Liver failure: The patient has a history of sarcoidosis leading to liver failure and is on the transplant list.
4. Osteomyelitis: The patient has significant ostomy output and may be at risk for developing osteomyelitis.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated urine sodium suggest AKI, possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome or pre-renal disease.
6. Seizures: The patient is being treated for seizures, possibly due to liver failure or electrolyte imbalances.

Note: The patient's complex medical history and current condition make her susceptible to various medical complications. Close monitoring and"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a medical history of hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She has been admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia, which resulted in hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increased settings.

The patient is also febrile and has been started on vancomycin and meropenem for possible aspiration pneumonia. She has a history of Zosyn-resistant Enterobacter in her sputum previously. Albuterol and ipratropium inhalers have been prescribed, and steroids are being held off for now.

The patient's sepsis, fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension are likely due to aspiration with possible pneumonia or pneumonitis. Bacteremia may be transient, a contaminant, or a true pathogen. The decision to remove the PICC line will depend on the species of the positive blood culture.

The patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and requires alternative access for central venous catheterization. A femoral line may be considered since the left-sided PICC line is infected.

The patient's ostomy output is significant, and liver services are managing this with octreotide and tincture of opium. Wound care with miconazole powder is also recommended.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted with hypoxia and respiratory failure due to an aspiration event. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increased settings.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: The most likely cause is aspiration given the witnessed aspiration event. The patient's ventilator settings were increased yesterday morning and will be decreased to [**11-16**].

2. Sepsis/fevers/tachycardia/hypotension: The patient may have pneumonia or pneumonitis as well as bacteremia (PICC line infection). There is a possibility of urinary source, but it is less likely. The patient's white blood cell count is stable at 10.0 K/uL.

3. Ostomy: The patient has significant ostomy output, and liver service has been titrating octreotide/tincture of opium for adequate control.

4. Low UOP: The patient is oliguric at 327 mL UOP yesterday. The urine sodium is more consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), rather than hepatorenal syndrome or pre-renal disease.

5. Seizures: The patient should continue on keppra and phenytoin.

6. Liver failure from sarc"

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and respiratory failure, most likely caused by aspiration. The patient was intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has multiple allergies, including hives from Cipro, Doxycycline, Pail, Quinine, Lithium, and Cefepime. She has received several antibiotics in the past, including Vancomycin and Meropenem. The patient is also taking Famotidine (Pepcid), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and Fentanyl infusions.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent event of vomiting with subsequent aspiration, leading to hypoxia and tachypnea. Her physical examination reveals clear bilateral chest sounds with some harsh breath sounds at the lung bases, a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated in her cardiovascular examination.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (14.2 K/u"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted with shortness of breath and hypoxia. Upon admission, she had an elevated respiratory rate, low blood pressure, and fever. The patient's condition worsened after an aspiration event, leading to intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/53 to 153/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted shortness of breath. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,681 mL and output of 2,623 mL, with a positive balance of 58 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (meropenem, cefepime), antipyretics (acetaminophen), antihypertensives (enalapril), and anticoagulants (heparin sodium). 

Physical examination reveals an alert patient on ventilator support, with clear lung sounds bilaterally and harsh breath sounds at the lung bases. The patient has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated in her cardiovascular"

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She has been experiencing vomiting and aspiration events, leading to hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but extubated yesterday. She is currently febrile and on meropenem, although the effectiveness of the antibiotic is unclear.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (HR) of 127 bpm, high blood pressure (BP) of 193/76 mmHg, increased respiratory rate (RR) of 40 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C). Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 98% on room air.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.2 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 45/55), and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on standby ventilator mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 372 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. The ABG shows hyperventilation. The chest X-ray reveals a white-out of the left base, indicating worsening pneumonia. Blood culture grew coag-negative staphylococci, which is likely a contaminant. Urine culture is growing yeast, and sputum culture is growing gram-negative rods. The patient's WBC count has decreased from 14.2 to 8.9 today. She has significant ostomy output, for which liver service is titrating octreotide/tincture of opium for adequate control. The patient is also on TPN and has a PICC line. She has a history of seizures, liver failure from sarcoidosis, and other medical conditions. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration events, and her current symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest worsening pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, t"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory failure due to an aspiration event. She is currently on invasive ventilation and has been experiencing fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension. Blood cultures have grown coag-negative Staphylococcus, but this is likely a contaminant. Urine cultures are growing yeast, and sputum cultures are growing Gram-negative rods. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 14.2. She also has an ostomy with significant output, and liver services have been titrating octreotide and tincture of opium for adequate control. The patient's urine output is low, and her creatinine levels are stable but oliguric. She is also experiencing seizures, and medications such as keppra and phenytoin are being continued. The patient has liver failure from sarcoidosis, and follow-up liver recommendations are pending. The patient will start total parenteral nutrition (TPN) today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of aspiration and current symptoms, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. The patient is already on meropenem for possible aspiration pneumonia, and sensitivities are awaiting.

   #) Hypoxia/Respiratory failure
 most likely cause is aspiration given
   witnessed aspiration event.
   - extubated yesterday
   - on meropenem but unclear if this is treating anything at present
   given fever spike and resp status. Will d/c and follow clinically and
   WBC.  Will also talk to ID
   - will continue albuterol/ipratropium inhalers
   - Pt had some SOB last night during which she stated she was anxious.
   ABG c/w hyperventilation.  Given 2mg IV morphine with good effect.  Pt
   remained comfortable throughout remainder of night.
   - CXR this AM shows white-out of left base, representing worsening
   pleural effusion ? of consolidation.
   - Plan to involve IP to tap effusion to eval for empyema.
   #) Ostomy
 has significant ostomy output.  Liver service has been
   titrating octreotide/tinctue of opium for adequate control.
   - on octreotide and tincture of opium
   - wound care per recs: miconazole powder
   - Will check C.diff
   #) Seizures:
   -continue keppra and phenytoin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a medical history of hepatic sarcoidosis, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted to the ICU due to a witnessed aspiration event, which led to hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been experiencing fever spikes and an increase in respiratory status. She was previously extubated but reintubated due to her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxia and subsequent respiratory failure is likely due to the aspiration event. This can lead to further lung damage and pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.

2. Pleural effusion/Consolidation: The chest X-ray shows worsening pleural effusion or consolidation. This indicates the possibility of infection or fluid accumulation in the lungs. Further evaluation, such as thoracentesis or bronchoscopy, may be necessary to determine the cause and guide treatment.

3. Liver failure from Sarcoidosis: The patient's history of hepatic sarcoidosis suggests the possibility of liver dysfunction. Monitoring liver enzymes and providing supportive care are important in managing this complication.

4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, for which she is being treated with keppra and phenytoin. Regular monitoring of seizure control and phenytoin levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a medical history of hepatic sarcoidosis, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia/respiratory failure due to aspiration. She has been experiencing fever, anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, and ostomy output issues. Her current medications include morphine, lorazepam, heparin, famotidine, and antibiotics. She is also on TPN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxia/respiratory failure due to aspiration. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation of the body and respiratory distress.
2. Infection: The patient has had low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an underlying infection. Possible sources include pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infection, or intra-abdominal infection.
3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Symptoms may include swelling, pain, and redness in the affected limb.
4. Liver Failure: The patient has hepatic sarcoidosis, which can cause liver dysfunction. Symptoms may include jaundice, ascites, and impaired liver function tests.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of portal gastropathy and gastrop"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of anxiety, hypertension, and multiple drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia, hypertension, and occasional hypotension. The patient is on multiple medications, including morphine for pain control and heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes, as well as low hemoglobin, platelet count, and albumin levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are also fluctuating. The patient's physical examination reveals altered mental status and abnormal skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 96%) indicates potential hypoxemia.
2. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative (-1,059 mL), indicating a possible fluid deficit. Electrolyte levels such as sodium, potassium, and chloride are within normal limits, but there are concerns regarding magnesium, calcium, and phosphate levels.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may suggest an ongoing infection.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium or a central nervous system infection.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobil"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has remained extubated over past 24 hrs and continues to have a
   weak cough with high risk for aspiration. She will need TPN, atrovent
   nebs ( tachycardia, anxiety), low dose ativan to help with anxiety with
   careful monitoring of mental status and continued antibiotics ( now on
   azteronam) while we monitor eospinophilia. If urine Eos are positive,
   we will increase dose of prednisone for short term. ( ? AIN to recent
   use of meropenem).
   Patient is ill and prognosis is guarded. She may leave ICU later today
   if respiratory status stable and no hemodynamic setback.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoid, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, most likely caused by aspiration. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including intubation, extubation, switching from meropenem to aztreonam, and receiving IV morphine for anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient has a history of aspiration events, which can lead to respiratory failure and hypoxia.
2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
3. Hepatic Sarcoidosis: The patient has a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, which can cause liver dysfunction and potentially lead to complications such as liver failure.
4. Anxiety: The patient experiences chronic anxiety, which may require ongoing management with medication and interventions.
5. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotension, which can be related to her anxiety or other underlying medical conditions.
6. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient may have an electrolyte and fluid disorder, as indicated by abnormal lab values.
7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to prolonged bedrest and pressure ulcer formation.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced hypog"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, gastroparesis, and portal gastropathy. She presented with vomiting and aspiration event, leading to hypoxia and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient was extubated and switched from meropenem to aztreonam due to a questionable drug reaction with eosinophilia. She has been experiencing low-grade temperatures and WBC trending down. The fever, low-grade temperature, and eosinophilia have been considered as potential causes such as SBP, pneumonia, C. difficile, and drug reaction. C. difficile has been ruled out. The patient's anxiety is being treated with ambien and ativan. Her tachycardia and hypertension are believed to be related to her anxiety. The patient has significant ostomy output, and liver service has been titrating octreotide/tincture of opium for adequate control. She is at risk for aspiration due to a weak cough. The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid levels. She is being treated for seizures, liver failure from sarcoidosis, and eosinophilia. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a PICC line in place. She is on prophylactic heparin for DVT, famotidine for stress ulcer, and has been weaned off the ventilator.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Upon admission, the patient was experiencing anxiety and tachycardia, which were initially treated with medication. However, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to the initiation of a hypertensive emergency workup. The patient received a total of 10 different medications, including morphine, lorazepam, metoprolol, and labetalol.

Over the course of the next few days, the patient's vital signs remained unstable, with fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. The patient required respiratory support but did not need supplemental oxygen. Blood cultures were taken, and the patient was administered multiple antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney function. Electrolyte imbalances were also noted, including low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were within normal range, but other lab values indicated possible muscle damage and impaired kidney function.

The patient's physical examination revealed tachycardia and fever. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray, were performed but the results are not provided in the note.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications. These include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient has a history of anxiety, hypertension, and multiple drug allergies. On the current day, the patient experienced an episode of tachycardia and hypertension, which led to the initiation of additional medications for anxiety and blood pressure control. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, but there are concerns regarding potential complications such as electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, hypoglycemia, hypotension, hypoxemia, airway protection issues, fever, deep vein thrombosis, and glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 950 mL, indicating ongoing fluid losses. Additionally, the labs indicate abnormalities in sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels, suggesting an electrolyte disorder.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's review of systems mentions unchanged skin, but there is no specific mention of impaired skin integrity. However, the presence of NG tube and drains may increase the risk of skin breakdown at those sites.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels were initially elevated but have decreased to 78 mg/dL. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent hypoglycemia.
4. Hypotension: Despite being on multiple vasodilators, the"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has had intermittent anxiety that responds to a combination of
   ativan and morphine. She has also needed dose escalation of her BP
   meds. She remains NPO with copious output from NG tube.
   She will need continued TPN and assessment for reasons regarding NG
   output by GI staff. She will maintain strict aspiration precautions
   even while sleeping. She continues on aztreonam for now for a full
   course. Eos will be checked again in 24 hrs. Prednisone dose may need
   to be increased for a few days if still high ( i.e > 30%). Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9587**]
   may opine on this if no other etiology for eosinophilia.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is ill but stable for transfer to the floor today and her
   husband has been updated
