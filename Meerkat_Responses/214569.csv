   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):
   Baseline creatinine about 2.2, urine output borderline many be simply
   secondary to his Chronic renal insufficiency, yet still prerenal by
   FEUN, but failed fluid challenge. Will allow him to reequilibrate and
   follow up creatinine. HOld off onhome torsemide for now. No current
   signs of volume overload.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN:
   Holding bblocker, and minoxidiol, and monitoring BP, contniue
   clonidine, and valsartan.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA;
   HONK [**1-12**] to prednisone, improved on NPH. Will readjust to home dose
   once diet is well estabilished wtih lantus qhs.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS:
   likely in setting of metabolic abnormality from HONK + old seizure
   focus, f/u EEG, f/u MRI/MRA today. Hold off on further anti-seizure
   medications for now. Neuro following.
Mental status improved: ? related to ativan, f/u CSF culture data
PNA: no signs of this, CXR clear today, will stop ceftriazxone and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. They have a history of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient experienced seizures, likely due to metabolic abnormalities from hyperglycemia and a previous seizure focus. They also had lactic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. The patient's vital signs were stable, but they had decreased urine output despite receiving a fluid challenge. An EEG was performed, and an MRI/MRA was scheduled for later that day. The patient's baseline creatinine level was about 2.2, and they had trace bilateral lower extremity edema. Their blood glucose levels were elevated, and their potassium and magnesium levels were low. The patient's mental status improved, possibly related to the use of ativan. There were no signs of pneumonia, and the chest X-ray showed resolution of atelectasis in the left lower lobe. The patient's antibiotic treatment will be discontinued. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level of 2.2 and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of ARF. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and severity of renal dysfunction.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently being managed with medications such as clonidine and valsartan. Blood pressure monitoring will continue to assess the effectiveness of these treatments.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypertension, and seizure. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status, which improved after treatment of his blood pressure. The patient's somnolence seemed to improve with the treatment of BP. It is likely that he missed a dose or two of his home medications. He is on minoxidil, which likely means his hypertension is very poorly controlled at baseline. 

The patient has been started on glargine, a long-acting insulin, as well as NPH insulin. His glucose levels have improved significantly with hydration, and it is likely worse due to recent prednisone use. 

The patient's renal function is concerning for acute renal failure. His creatinine levels were elevated on admission and were improving with fluids, but then increased again the night prior. There is concern for a prerenal state in the setting of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). FeNa/Fe urea is consistent with a prerenal state this morning. 

The patient's pneumonia is less likely given improved findings on chest X-ray today, absence of fever, and no coughing. 

The patient's heart failure appears to be stable, with volume down currently. He will continue on metoprolol and valsartan. Torsemide has been held due to dehydration, and can be restarted if signs of volume overload develop.

- The patient, a 72-year-old male, presented with hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypertension, and seizure.
- The patient's mental status improved after treatment.
- A possible cause of the seizure could be hyperglycemia or prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) seen on the CT scan.
- CSF analysis showed 2 WBCs and 1 RBC, indicating no signs of meningitis or encephalitis.
- Tox screen was negative.
- The patient's altered mental status was initially thought to be post-ictal but is now likely due to missed doses of home medications.
- The patient has a history of diabetes, gout, hypertension, and congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient's blood glucose levels are significantly improved with hydration.
- There are concerns about acute renal failure, as the patient's creatinine level rose again despite improvement with fluids.

   seen on CT scan. CSF w/ 2 WBCs and 1 RBC so does not appear
   meningitis/encephalitis. Tox screen negative. His altered mental status
   is now likely post ictal vs from ativan. but seems to be clearing.

   improved. His somnolence seemed to improve w/ treatment of BP. Likely
   that he missed a dose or two of his home meds. He is on minoxidil so
   likely very poorly controlled HTN at baseline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypertension, and seizure. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status but is now showing improvement. The patient's seizures were initially thought to be due to hyperglycemia or a possible stroke, but further evaluation including a CT scan and CSF analysis did not reveal any acute events. His altered mental status is believed to be post-ictal rather than caused by ativan. The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management, including hypertension, hyperglycemia/diabetes, acute renal failure, pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), gout, and familial essential hypertension (FEN). He is currently on various medications including insulin, metoprolol, valsartan, allopurinol, and subcutaneous heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may have contributed to the acute hypertensive episode in the late afternoon. Close monitoring of blood pressure and continuation of home medications are essential.
2. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes: The patient's blood glucose levels were elevated on multiple occasions, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Insulin therapy has been initiated, and close monitoring of glucose levels is necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated since admission, and there is concern for acute renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous seizures. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and recent seizures. The patient underwent an MRI/MRA, which showed no acute infarction but revealed new chronic microvascular infarcts since 2142. The patient was discharged from the hospital in 2142. He was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin antibiotics but was discontinued today. The patient's insulin regimen was changed to glargine. His urine electrolytes indicate prerenal azotemia. The neurologist advised against starting antiepileptic drugs for now and recommended following the patient clinically. The patient is advised not to drive for six months due to his diabetes and recent seizures. An EEG showed no seizures. The patient was hypertensive in the late afternoon, given home blood pressure medications, and improved. He became agitated overnight and required redirection several times. He was given haloperidol 0.5 mg and restrained as he was pulling off leads and gown. The patient called out but there was no bed available.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output, indicating potential renal impairment.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, which may indicate poorly controlled diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypertension, and seizure. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status but is now showing improvement. The patient has multiple medical complications including possible causes for his seizure, such as hyperglycemia or prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) seen on CT scan. His altered mental status is likely post-ictal rather than from ativan. The patient also has hyperglycemia, which has improved with hydration and likely worsened due to recent prednisone use. He has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, indicating prerenal state in the setting of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). The patient's pneumonia is less likely given the current CXR findings. He has stable gout and no signs of heart failure or fluid-electrolyte imbalance. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs show hypertension and tachycardia, but other parameters are within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, and possible causes include hyperglycemia or prior CVA. It is important to monitor glucose levels, consider starting Dilantin if seizures recur, and perform an MRI/MRA to look for CVA.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypertension, and seizure activity. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, but there are indications of improvement. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are as follows:

1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, which could be caused by hyperglycemia or a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) seen on the CT scan. Monitoring glucose levels and administering a loading dose of Dilantin if the patient seizes again would be appropriate. An MRI/MRA should be done to look for evidence of CVA, and CSF cultures should be followed up as there is a suspicion of meningitis/encephalitis. The altered mental status could be post-ictal or due to the medication Ativan.

2. Facial droop: There is a mention of a possible left facial droop, but it is unclear if this is a new symptom or not. A neurological follow-up and an MRI/MRA today are recommended to further evaluate this.

3. Hypertension (HTN): The patient had high blood pressure upon arrival to the ICU, which may have been a result of the seizure. Treatment of the BP improved the patient's somnolence. The patient is on minoxidil, which suggests poorly controlled hypertension at baseline. Home medications should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and seizure. The patient has been in the ICU for 24 hours and has been receiving various medications including Haloperidol for agitation, Heparin for prophylaxis, and Glargine for hyperglycemia. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/66 mmHg to 189/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels but stable creatinine levels. Imaging studies, including EEG and MRI, have shown no seizure activity or acute events. The patient's confusion is resolving, and they are alert and oriented. The plan is to continue with glycemic control, behavioral management for sundowning, and ongoing monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin have been initiated.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this, including"
