   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with history of bipolar d/o and now found outside of home
   with unresponsive state.  Patient to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation where son
   noted patient was well the day prior.  At [**Hospital1 **] patient with
   hyperglycemia and negative CT/LP and patient to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care
   following 1g of Dilantin.  She has remained with persistent altered
   mental status and to this point remains unresponsive.  Vanco/Zosyn/CTX
   was given and patient admitted to ICU for further care.
   1) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/COMA
She has impaired and persistent coma
   noted at this time.  This raises concern for diffuse cortical insult
   which has not been seen with tox screen, LP, look for systemic
   infection which have not been revealing.  This would leave possible
   pontine level infarct as driver of insult with non-convulsive status
   being second most likely insult.
   -MRI this morning
   -EEG this morning
   -Will move to treatment for seizures  based on EEG findings and
   clinical response but would like to defer on treatment for seizures
   until EEG completed.
   2) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)-_This may be hypovolemic but perhaps
   vasodilatory in the setting of severe neurologic insult consistent with
   neurogenic shock is most likely.
   -Levophed as needed
   -Fluid bolus as needed
   -Empiric antibiotics reasonable
   3)Aspiraiton
patient at risk for aspiration event with altered mental
   status and will have to continue to suction frequently and maintain
   adequate airway protection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder who was found unresponsive outside of her home. She was initially taken to Hospital1, where she had hyperglycemia but no significant findings on CT/LP. She was then transferred to Hospital15 for further care, where she received Dilantin and remained unresponsive. She was admitted to the ICU and started on vancomycin,zosyn, and ceftriaxone. The patient's current condition includes a persistent altered mental status and impaired coma. Her vital signs are stable, but she is at risk for hypotension and aspiration. Initial lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low potassium levels, and normal liver function tests. Imaging shows no signs of edema or blood on the CT scan of the head, and her chest X-ray is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse cortical insult: The patient's persistent coma raises concern for a diffuse cortical insult, which has not been confirmed by toxicology screen, lumbar puncture, or systemic infection evaluation. An MRI and EEG have been ordered to further investigate this possibility.
2. Hypotension: The patient may be experiencing hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia or vasodilation related to severe neurological insult, possibly neurogenic shock.
3. Aspiration: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to her altered mental status and will require frequent suctioning and adequate air"

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.
   CXR [**2-16**] #2:
   IMPRESSION: Successful intubation without evidence of pneumothorax. NG
   position unremarkable. Previously suspected right-sided pleural
   effusion not
   progressing and mostly resolved.

   #.  Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory status
 Patient had an aspiration
   event yesterday, and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of
   100.4 yesterday afternoon, afebrile since.  Currenly, lungs are clear,
   mental status improving
   -          repeat CXR
   -          SBT, extubate if her mental status improves
   -          Consider either stopping antibiotics if CXR clear, or
   broadening spectrum to cover anaerobes (given aspiration event) &/or
   pseudomonas if she deteriorates.
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses. She was admitted with altered mental status.

24-hour events include:
- MRI head showed no infarction or mass.
- Preliminary EEG showed no evidence of seizure.
- The patient started on dilantin IV TID.
- Blood and urine cultures were pending.
- CSF gram stain showed no organisms, but sent for herpes PCR.
- The patient was diagnosed with Hep C and HIV negative.
- The patient aspirated and desaturated, leading to intubation.
- Code status confirmed as full code.
- Dilantin level was below the desired range, so additional dose given.
- Started 24-hour EEG.
- Ammonia level was normal, and lamictal level pending per PM neuro recs.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed.
- Invasive ventilation started.

Allergies include clindamycin and unknown. The last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

Infusions include norepinephrine, dilantin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.
   CXR [**2-16**] #2:
   IMPRESSION: Successful intubation without evidence of pneumothorax. NG
   position unremarkable. Previously suspected right-sided pleural
   effusion not
   progressing and mostly resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated, her MS exam is somewhat limited.
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - empiric antibiotics
   .
   #. Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory status
 Patient had an aspiration
   event yesterday, and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of
   100.4 yesterday afternoon, afebrile since.  Currenly, lungs are clear,
   mental status improving
   -          repeat CXR
   -          SBT, extubate if her mental status
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output
   - hold lisinopril
   .
   3.  Elevated lactate.  Elevated lactate raises the possibility of an
   infection infectious workup is negative thus far.  Also, could be
   secondary to seizure activity.
   - trend lactate
   - IVFs boluses prn
   - empiric antibiotics with ceftriaxone/vanco pending culture data
   .
   4.  Hyperglycemia.  Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450 which
   has responded to insulin.  No evidence of DKA.

   6.  Hepatitis C.  Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
   albumin.  INR normal at OSH.  Per son, this is a recent diagnosis.
   LFTs stable yesterday.  Ammonia normal. No evidence of cirrhosis by
   labs or on exam.

   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.
   CXR [**2-16**] #2:
   IMPRESSION: Successful intubation without evidence of pneumothorax. NG
   position unremarkable. Previously suspected right-sided pleural
   effusion not
   progressing and mostly resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated and sedated it is difficult to follow her exam
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - periodically wean sedation to assess mental status
   - empiric antibiotics
   .
   #. Aspiration Pneumonia
 Patient had an aspiration event yesterday,
   and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of 100.4 yesterday
   afternoon, afebrile since.
   - consider broadening coverage given intubated on vent, in ICU,
   ceftriaxone to zosyn.
   - CXR
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - antibiotics as above
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output
   - hold home lisinopril
   .
   3.  Elevated lactate.  Elevated lactate raises the possibility of an
   infection infectious workup is negative thus far.  Also, could be
   secondary to seizure activity.
   - trend lactate
   - IVFs boluses prn
   - empiric antibiotics with ceftriaxone/vanco pending culture data
   .
   4.  Hyperglycemia.  Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450 which
   has responded to insulin.  No evidence of DKA.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - hold actos, glyburide, metformin
   .
   5.  Bipolar disorder.  Patient has a history of bipolar disorder, on
   disability.  Multiple prior overdoses with medications.
   - hold lexapro
   .
   6.  Hepatitis C.  Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
   albumin.  INR normal at OSH.  Per son, this is a recent diagnosis.
   LFTs stable yesterday.  Ammonia normal. No evidence of cirrhosis by
   labs or on exam.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted with altered mental status. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Altered mental status: The etiology of the altered mental status is unclear. An MRI showed no infarct, and lumbar puncture results from OSH were unremarkable. All toxic screens were negative, but the patient tested positive for hepatitis C. Currently, she is undergoing a 24-hour EEG with dilantin loading for possible intermittent seizures. It is difficult to follow her examination as she is now intubated and sedated.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had an aspiration event yesterday, and a chest X-ray confirmed the presence of aspiration pneumonia. She was intubated for airway safety. Her temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday afternoon has since subsided. Consider broadening coverage given that she is intubated on ventilatory support in the ICU, and switch ceftriaxone to zosyn.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. She has been positive for 4 liters of fluid since admission and is still on levophed. Good urine output has been maintained. IV fluid boluses, antibiotics as mentioned above, weaning off levophed as tolerated,"

   62 yo female with admission with COMA.  She has a history of substance
   abuse but no ingestion suspected, reported or found.  She does have
   bipolar diagnosis but no evidence of recent trauma or worsening of
   underlying mental health disease.  No recent prodrome of infection, no
   fever and no evidence of meningitis.  We have concern for possible
   seizure--with non-convulsive status or dense post ictal state driving
   exam.
   1)Altered Mental Status-Differential above
she has improved through to
   this morning
   -Dilantin load in place
   -EEG for 24 hours today.
   -Will move towards extubation today to faciliate better examination
   going forward.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -This was secondary to altered mental status and aspiration event with
   hypoxemia.  Much of the infiltrate was resolved in the setting of
   intubation but with some persistence
   -We have minimal secretions at this time
   -Will continue antibiotics that were started in the setting of concern
   for meningitis as we are now treating pneumonia
   -Move to SBT today and extubation with patient able to respond to
   commands
   3) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -Levophed to look to wean to off today and have minimal dose
   -Will continue with wean
   -[**Month (only) 8**] see improvement with resolution of active pneumonitis and will
   continue with antibiotics

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of coma. She was admitted with respiratory failure and has been in the ICU since then. The patient has a history of substance abuse and bipolar disorder but no recent ingestion, trauma, or worsening mental health disease. There is no evidence of recent infection or meningitis. The patient's altered mental status has improved, and she responds to voice commands. She also shows signs of clonus in her right lower extremity and brisk reflexes at the patellar tendon.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's current condition of being in a coma may persist or worsen, leading to further neurological issues.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience difficulty breathing or ongoing respiratory problems due to the previous aspiration event and pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low, and there is a concern for potential hypotension or shock.
4. Infection: Despite the absence of fever and evidence of meningitis, the patient has been treated with antibiotics due to concerns for pneumonia. There is a risk of developing other infections while in the ICU.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in her legs due to immobility in the ICU.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient may be at risk for developing pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and a history of multiple suicide attempts.
- She was admitted with altered mental status, which is believed to be due to a supratherapeutic level of lamictal, a medication for bipolar disorder.
- MRI results showed no infarction or mass, only chronic small vessel ischemic changes and an incidental finding of cavum septum pellucidum et vergae.
- The patient underwent extubation and is now verbal and communicative.
- Her blood pressure has improved, and she is off pressors.
- She has shown improvement in her respiratory status, with clear lungs on examination.
- The patient's glucose level was initially very high but has responded to insulin.
- She has a history of hepatitis C, but ammonia levels are normal, and there is no evidence of cirrhosis.
- She also has a history of bipolar disorder and multiple prior overdoses with medications.
- Potential complications include intermittent seizures, aspiration pneumonia, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and hepatitis C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intermittent Seizures: The patient is undergoing a 24-hour EEG with a dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. The elevated lamictal level may also contribute to seizure risk.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of altered mental status, which increases the risk of aspiration."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated, her MS exam is somewhat limited.
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - empiric antibiotics for now
   .
   #.  Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory status
 Patient had an aspiration
   event yesterday, and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of
   100.4 yesterday afternoon, afebrile since.  Currenly, lungs are clear,
   mental status improving
   -          repeat CXR
   -          SBT, extubate if her mental status improves
   -          Consider either stopping antibiotics if CXR clear, or
   broadening spectrum to cover anaerobes (given aspiration event) &/or
   pseudomonas if she deteriorates.
   .

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis C, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, and the etiology of this change is unclear. MRI results showed no infarct, and a lumbar puncture from outside hospital was unremarkable. Tox screens were negative, but she tested positive for hepatitis C. Ammonia levels were normal. The patient underwent a 24-hour EEG with dilantin loading for possible intermittent seizures and is currently intubated due to an aspiration event. 

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:
1. Altered mental status with unclear etiology. Neurological recommendations include following up on the EEG and consulting with neurology.
2. Aspiration pneumonia/respiratory status. The patient had an aspiration event yesterday, leading to intubation. Clearing of the lungs and improvement in mental status are positive signs. Repeat chest X-ray, spontaneous breathing test, and consideration of extubation or broadening antibiotic spectrum if necessary are recommended.
3. Hypotension. The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. Positive fluid balance since admission and use of levophed indicate ongoing management. Intravenous fluid boluses, weaning off levophed, monitoring urine output, and holding lisinopril are suggested interventions.
4. Hyperglycemia. The patient presented with high blood glucose"

   As above, etiology of here unresponsiveness likely secondary to
   lamictal overdose.  Appreciate input from neurology and psychiatry
   services.  Preliminary read on EEG is not seizure activity, will
   confirm with neuro and discontinue dilantin.  Agree with sitter
   awaiting inpatient  placement for psychiatric care.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis C, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted with altered mental status and is currently in the ICU. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Lamictal overdose: The patient's lamictal level is at 35, which is above the normal limit of 25. This can cause symptoms such as agitation and altered mental status.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory distress and infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which can be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient presented with hyperglycemia initially, but it has responded to insulin treatment.
5. Bipolar disorder: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and multiple prior suicide attempts. It is important to monitor for any psychiatric symptoms and consider psychiatric admission once the patient is medically stable.
6. Hepatitis C: The patient has a recent diagnosis of hepatitis C, and there is an increase in liver enzymes. Monitoring liver function and providing appropriate treatment is necessary.
7. Intermittent seizures: The patient is undergoing a 24-hour EEG to evaluate for possible intermittent seizures, and dilantin has been started for seizure prophylaxis.

These are some of the potential medical complications that can arise in the"
