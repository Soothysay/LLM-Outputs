","Summary:
- 55-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15% who experienced a ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest and is currently in cardiogenic shock.
- Patient was intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a history of diabetes, but finger stick blood glucose levels have improved to normal range.
- He also has a history of coronary artery disease with a blocked right coronary artery (RCA) and a partially blocked left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- The patient's neurologic status is described as responsive and able to follow simple commands.
- There are no signs of thrombus on repeat echocardiograms.
- Liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting possible shock liver.
- Kidney function is compromised, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- White blood cell count is elevated, which may be a result of the arrest.

Potential medical complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is already experiencing cardiogenic shock due to the VT/VF arrest and underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on his ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD with DES in RCA and partial blockage in LAD"

The patient is a 55-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%. He experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was transferred to the ICU in cardiogenic shock. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving invasive ventilation. He is on multiple infusions, including amiodarone, midazolam, fentanyl, dopamine, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 127/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and he has trace bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin T, lactate, and liver enzymes. The patient's urine output is low. An echocardiogram revealed 3+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation. The patient's neurological status is responsive and follows simple commands. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock due to his ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent VT/VF arrest. Close monitoring and management of hemodynamics are crucial.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intub"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p VT/VF arrest
   transfered with cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Shock/Arrest: Initial rhythm appears to be VF with e/o VT throughout
   ACLS treatment.  Could be [**3-16**] to thrombosis of DES in RCA vs. occlusion
   of LAD although both seem unlikely given relatively flat biomarkers
   post-arrest.  Scar mediated VT/VF is a possibility.  Currently, most
   likely in cardiogenic shock s/p arrest with improving hemodynamics on
   arrival.  Nothing by history to suggest another etiology for arrest
   although cannot exclude the possibility.
   - pt off of pressors; continue to monitor BP
   - cardiac catheterization possibly tomorrow
   - If deteriorates clinically would consider cath urgently.
   - Consider RHC PRN.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt is oriented to person and place only.  Pt
   baseline not entirely clear.  Possibly etiologies could include
   infection versus neurologic effects from patient
s recent cardiac
   arrest.  No clear signs of infection, although pt does have a cough on
   exam.
   - CXR
   - CT Head
   - UA/Ucx
   - Blood Cx
   - follow neuro status
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for airway protection.  High
   peak pressures on the vent, with relatively small tidal volumes.  CXR
   unimpressive, and oxygenating well.  Pt is now s/p extubation and
   satting well.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   .
   # CORONARIES: 2 vessel CAD with DES in RCA.  Plan as outlined above.
   - Aspirin
   - Plavix
   - Heparin gtt restarted now that INR <2
   - Continue statin.
   .
   # PUMP/Valves:
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - consider echo to evaluate cardiac function
   - f/u final read of echo
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm.  Monitor on tele.
   - Will need ICD for secondary prevention
   - f/u additional EP recs
   .
   # Diabetes: Finger sticks have improved to normal range.  Does not
   require insulin at home but poorly controlled on oral agents.
   - hold metformin.
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   - continue fingersticks
   .
   # LV Thrombus:
   - No e/o thrombus on repeat echo's, and ? need to continue coumadin
   long-term
   - Supratherapeutic INR likely [**3-16**] coumadin at home with superimposed
   portion from liver failure.
   - Now that INR<2, heparin gtt started
   .
   # Liver Injury: Likely shock liver. Improving.
   - Trend enzymes
   .
   # Renal Failure: Likely ATN. Renal function improving.
   - I/O
   - foley catheter
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely [**3-16**] arrest. Resolved.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%. He experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventricular Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of VT/VF arrest and ischemic cardiomyopathy, there is a risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Close monitoring and consideration for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention may be necessary.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, which is a potential complication of severe heart dysfunction. Hemodynamic monitoring and optimization of cardiac support are essential.

3. Infection: The patient has a cough on examination, and further investigation for possible infection is warranted. Appropriate cultures and imaging studies should be considered.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of renal dysfunction, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.

5. Liver Injury: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting possible liver injury. Trending liver function tests and considering the need for supportive measures like nutritional support may be necessary.

6. Diabetes Management: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, followed by cardiogenic shock. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, with a blood pressure of 127/82 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.7°C.

The patient is extubated successfully and is now on continuous infusion of amiodarone. He has a history of ethanol abuse and is being monitored closely for any signs of withdrawal. The patient's allergies include penicillins, which may cause rash and hives. His last dose of antibiotics was on [**2106-4-11**].

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the cough noted in the physical examination. His fluid balance shows an intake of 699 mL and output of 2,735 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,036 mL. His respiratory support consists of an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and standby ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 393 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 13.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.6 g/dL, normal platelet count (Plt) at 146, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 2.0 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T at 0.62, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 617 IU/L. The patient's electrolytes show a slightly low potassium level (K+) at 3.9 mEq/L and a normal chloride level (Cl-) at 108 mEq/L.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Shock/Arrest: The patient experienced a VT/VF arrest, which was treated with ACLS protocol. The cause is still uncertain, but possibilities include thrombosis of the distal epicardial coronary artery (DES) in the right coronary artery (RCA) or occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). However, both seem unlikely given the relatively flat biomarkers post-arrest. Scar-mediated VT/VF is also a possibility. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock but has improving hemodynamics.

Plan: Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure, consider cardiac catheterization tomorrow, and if the patient deteriorates clinically, consider cath urgently. Consider right heart catheterization (RHC) as needed.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is oriented"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p VT/VF arrest
   transfered with cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Shock/Arrest: Initial rhythm appears to be VF with e/o VT throughout
   ACLS treatment.  Could be [**3-16**] to thrombosis of DES in RCA vs. occlusion
   of LAD although both seem unlikely given relatively flat biomarkers
   post-arrest.  Scar mediated VT/VF is a possibility.  Currently, most
   likely in cardiogenic shock s/p arrest with improving hemodynamics on
   arrival.  Nothing by history to suggest another etiology for arrest
   although cannot exclude the possibility.
   - wean dopamine with MAP goal > 60.
   - weaned levophed to off on arrival.
   - If deteriorates clinically would consider cath urgently, otherwise
   plan for cath on Monday if INR allows.
   - Repeat ECG in AM.
   - Consider RHC PRN.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated for airway protection.  High peak
   pressures on the vent, with relatively small tidal volumes.  CXR
   unimpressive, and oxygenating well.
   - Wean as tolerated.
   - RSBI, possible extubate
   .
   # CORONARIES: 2 vessel CAD with DES in RCA.  Plan as outlined above.
   - Aspirin
   - Plavix
   - Hold heparin gtt as INR supratherapeutic on coumadin.
   - High dose statin in acute setting until cath and then consider return
   to home dose if no acute plaque rupture detected.
   .
   # PUMP/Valves:  3+MR/2+TR by echo [**2106**].
   - Repeat Echo to evaluate for new wall motion abnormalities and
   progression of valvular disease that might be contributing to shock
   - Diurese as tolerated.
   - Central Venous O2 sat for Fick Cardiac Output
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm.  Monitor on tele.
   - Will need ICD for secondary prevention
   .
   # Neuro Status: With sedation weaned is responsive and follows simple
   commands.  Reportedly CT head negative at OSH.
   - wean sedation
   - follow exam closely
   .
   # Diabetes: Finger sticks have improved to normal range.  Does not
   require insulin at home but poorly controlled on oral agents.
   - hold metformin.
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # LV Thrombus:
   - No e/o thrombus on repeat echo's, and ? need to continue coumadin
   long-term
   - Heparin gtt when INR < 2.0
   - hold vitamin K/coumadin and allow INR to reverse on its own.
   - Likely [**3-16**] coumadin at home with superimposed portion from liver
   failure.
   .
   # Liver Injury: Likely shock liver.
   - Trend enzymes
   .
   # Renal Failure: Likely ATN.  Send urinalysis, urine lytes.
   - I/O
   - foley catheter
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely [**3-16**] to arrest.
   - Panculture
   .
   # Access:
   - need to resite R IJ CVL
   - radial artery

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU for VT/VF arrest. The patient has a history of diabetes and heart disease. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple events including VT/VF arrest, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient underwent several interventions such as administration of heparin, conversion of amiodarone to PO, placement of arterial and central lines, and extubation. The patient's current vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 150/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient is currently on CIWA due to a past history of etoh abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest: The patient initially presented with VT/VF arrest, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. This indicates an underlying cardiac issue that could potentially lead to further arrhythmias or cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may indicate a neurological complication or the effect of medications. Monitoring for any changes in consciousness or cognition is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension suggests possible"

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST
   55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p VT/VF arrest
   transferred with cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Shock/Arrest: Initial rhythm appears to be VF with e/o VT throughout
   ACLS treatment.  Could be [**3-16**] to thrombosis of DES in RCA vs. occlusion
   of LAD although both seem unlikely given relatively flat biomarkers
   post-arrest.  Scar mediated VT/VF is a possibility.  Currently, most
   likely in cardiogenic shock s/p arrest with improving hemodynamics on
   arrival.  Nothing by history to suggest another etiology for arrest
   although cannot exclude the possibility.
   - pt off of pressors; continue to monitor BP
   - ICD placement if MS improves. [**Month (only) 51**] also consider cardiac cath in
   future with ?  reperfusible injury.
   - If deteriorates clinically would consider cath urgently.
   .
   Hypertension: Initially admitted for cardiogenic shock however
   currently hypertensive. Enalapril was hold due to renal function
   depressed.
   Increase carvedilol, restart low dose ace (lisinopril 5)
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt is oriented to person and place only.  Pt
   baseline not entirely clear.  Possibly etiologies could include
   infection versus neurologic effects from patient
s recent cardiac
   arrest.  No clear signs of infection, although pt does have a cough on
   exam.
   - CXR unremarkable, no leukoctosis. Unable to get sputum as pt can
   expectorate.
   - CT Head
prelim read negative. f/u if any mention anoxic brain injury
   in final read.
   - Ucx/Blood Cx pending
   - follow neuro status
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for airway protection.  High
   peak pressures on the vent, with relatively small tidal volumes.  CXR
   unimpressive, and oxygenating well.  Pt is now s/p extubation and
   satting well.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   .
   # CORONARIES: 2 vessel CAD with DES in RCA.  Plan as outlined above.
   - Aspirin
   - Plavix
   - Heparin gtt restarted now that INR <2
   - Continue statin.
   .
   # PUMP/Valves:
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - f/u final read of echo
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm.  Monitor on tele.
   - Will need ICD for secondary prevention
   - f/u additional EP recs
   .
   # Diabetes: Finger sticks have improved to normal range.  Does not
   require insulin at home but poorly controlled on oral agents.
   - hold metformin.
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   - continue fingersticks
   .
   # LV Thrombus:
   - No e/o thrombus on repeat echo's, and ? need to continue coumadin
   long-term
   - Supratherapeutic INR likely [**3-16**] coumadin at home with superimposed
   portion from liver failure.
   - Now that INR<2, heparin gtt started
   .
   # Liver Injury: Likely shock liver. Improving.
   - Trend enzymes
   .
   # Renal Failure: Likely ATN. Renal function improving.
   - I/O
   - foley catheter
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely [**3-16**] arrest. Resolved.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15% who experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and is now in cardiogenic shock. The initial rhythm during the arrest was VF with evidence of VT throughout ACLS treatment. Possible causes for the arrest include thrombosis of the distal epicardial vessels in the right coronary artery (RCA) or occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), although both seem unlikely given relatively flat biomarkers post-arrest. Scar-mediated VT/VF is also a possibility.

The patient has a history of diabetes and hypertension. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 150/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 36.4%, platelet count (Plt) at 146 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.0 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.62 ng/mL, lactate at 1.1 mmol/L, and lactic acid at 1.1 mmol/L. Electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.

The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease with a stent in the RCA. The plan is to continue with aspirin, Plavix, heparin gtt, and a statin.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of infection and neurologic effects from the recent cardiac arrest. A CT head was performed and showed no abnormalities. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient initially required intubation for airway protection due to respiratory failure, but is now successfully extubated and oxygenating well. He is expected to continue monitoring his respiratory status.

Other findings include hypertension, LV thrombus, liver injury, renal failure, and leukocytosis, all of which are improving.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may be at risk for recurrent VT/VF due to his ischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced ejection fraction. There is also a possibility of developing further complications related to his hypertension, diabetes, and renal failure. Close monitoring of his cardiac function, electrolyte levels, and medication regimen will be crucial in preventing and managing these potential complications."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9496**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Still somewhat confused but hemodynamically stable.  I would avoid
   heart catheterization at this point given altered mental status and
   absence of ACS.  Patient care time 40 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current conditions, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's initial presentation was cardiogenic shock, which is a serious complication of a cardiac arrest. It occurs when the heart fails to pump blood effectively, leading to inadequate perfusion of vital organs.

2. Hypertension: The patient is currently hypertensive, and it is important to monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent complications such as heart failure, hemorrhagic stroke, or other organ damage.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is disoriented to place and time, indicating altered mental status. This could be due to various reasons including neurological effects from the recent cardiac arrest, infection, or other underlying causes. Close monitoring and further investigation are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for airway protection and mechanical ventilation. Although they have been successfully extubated, ongoing monitoring of respiratory status is essential to detect any signs of respiratory failure or worsening lung function.

5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD with double vessel disease and stenting in the right coronary artery (RCA). Proper management of coronary artery disease is crucial to prevent further cardiac events such as recurrent arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina.

6. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management is crucial to prevent"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU for a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, heart disease, and a history of alcohol abuse.

On day 1, the patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo, blood cultures, and urine culture. The patient was advanced to a diabetic, heart-healthy diet and started on heparin due to a subtherapeutic INR. The patient also received a head CT, chest X-ray, urine culture, and blood cultures. Carvedilol was restarted at 6.25 mg and converted to PO amiodarone 400 mg TID. A second PIV was placed and the RIJ CVL was pulled. Carvedilol was increased to 12.5 mg, and TEE showed next RV free wall hypokinesis. The patient was successfully extubated.

On day 2, the patient's review of systems remained unchanged from admission except for new onset of altered mental status. The patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/78 mmHg to 168/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm remained in sinus rhythm.

The patient's labs showed elevated white blood cell"

 CARDIAC ARREST
   55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p VT/VF arrest
   transfered with cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Shock/Arrest: Initial rhythm appears to be VF with e/o VT throughout
   ACLS treatment.  Could be [**3-16**] to thrombosis of DES in RCA vs. occlusion
   of LAD although both seem unlikely given relatively flat biomarkers
   post-arrest.  Scar mediated VT/VF is a possibility.  Currently, most
   likely in cardiogenic shock s/p arrest with improving hemodynamics on
   arrival.  Nothing by history to suggest another etiology for arrest
   although cannot exclude the possibility.
   - pt off of pressors; continue to monitor BP
   - cardiac catheterization possibly tomorrow
   - If deteriorates clinically would consider cath urgently.
   - Consider RHC PRN.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt is oriented to person and place only.  Pt
   baseline not entirely clear.  Possibly etiologies could include
   infection versus neurologic effects from patient
s recent cardiac
   arrest.  No clear signs of infection, although pt does have a cough on
   exam.
   - CXR
   - CT Head
   - UA/Ucx
   - Blood Cx
   - follow neuro status
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for airway protection.  High
   peak pressures on the vent, with relatively small tidal volumes.  CXR
   unimpressive, and oxygenating well.  Pt is now s/p extubation and
   satting well.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%. He experienced a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest and was transferred to the ICU for cardiogenic shock. The initial rhythm during the arrest was VF with episodes of VT throughout. ACLS treatment was performed, and the patient is now in sinus rhythm. The patient's baseline mental status is altered, and he is only oriented to person and place. Possible etiologies include infection or neurologic effects from the recent cardiac arrest. No clear signs of infection are present, but the patient has a cough on exam. The patient was initially intubated for airway protection but is now successfully extubated and oxygenating well. He has a history of diabetes, which is poorly controlled on oral agents, and he requires insulin at home. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease with a stent in the right coronary artery. He is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and heparin. His renal and liver function are improving, and there is no evidence of thrombus on repeat echocardiograms. The patient has leukocytosis but it has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's current condition indicates cardiogenic shock due to the ischemic cardiomyopathy and VT/VF arrest. Monitoring hemodynamics and considering cardiac catheterization"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p VT/VF arrest
   transferred with cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Initial rhythm VF with e/o VT throughout ACLS
   treatment.  Could be [**3-16**] to thrombosis of DES in RCA vs. occlusion of
   LAD vs. scar-mediated.  Currently hemodynamically stable.
   - ICD placement if MS improves
   . Consider cardiac cath
   - If deteriorates clinically would consider cath urgently
   .
   # Hypertension: BP well-controlled on lisinopril, carvedilol, and
   spironolactone.
   - monitor BP, continue lisinopril, carvedilol, spironolactone
   - consider uptitrating lisinopril
   # Altered Mental Status: Improving, but still with deficits in memory
   and following complex commands. CT head with no intracranial process.
   Infectious work-up negative to date.  Likely related to recent cardiac
   arrest.
   - f/u MRI
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   - continue to monitor neuro status
   .
   # CORONARIES: 2 vessel CAD with DES in RCA.  Plan as outlined above.
   - Aspirin
   - Plavix
   - Heparin gtt restarted now that INR <2 (indication is h/o LV thrombus)
   - Continue statin
   .
   # PUMP/Valves: Initially presented in cardiogenic shock s/p arrest but
   no hemodynamically stable. Appears euvolemic. Echo showed new RV
   hypokinesis.
   - d/c Foley as no longer needed for hemodynamic monitoring
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm.  Monitor on tele.
   - Will need ICD for secondary prevention
   - f/u EP recs
   .
   # Diabetes: Finger sticks have improved to normal range.  Does not
   require insulin at home but poorly controlled on oral agents.
   - hold metformin.
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   - continue fingersticks
   .
   # LV Thrombus:
   - No e/o thrombus on repeat echo's, and ? need to continue coumadin
   long-term
   - Supratherapeutic INR likely [**3-16**] coumadin at home with superimposed
   portion from liver failure.
   - Now that INR<2, heparin gtt started

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%. The patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, leading to cardiogenic shock. He was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypertension, which is well-controlled with lisinopril, carvedilol, and spironolactone. There are plans to consider uptitrating lisinopril if necessary. The patient also has altered mental status with deficits in memory and following complex commands. A CT scan of the head showed no intracranial process, and infectious work-up has been negative. This condition is likely related to the recent cardiac arrest.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a stent in the right coronary artery (RCA). The plan is to place an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if medical status improves and consider a cardiac catheterization if the patient deteriorates clinically.

Other medical conditions include pump,valves, rhythm, diabetes, left ventricular thrombus, liver injury, and renal failure. The patient's diabetes has improved with finger sticks showing normal ranges, but he remains poorly controlled on oral agents. Metformin has been held, and humalog insulin sliding scale has been initiated.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p VT/VF arrest
   transferred with cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Shock/Arrest: Initial rhythm appears to be VF with e/o VT throughout
   ACLS treatment.  Could be [**3-16**] to thrombosis of DES in RCA vs. occlusion
   of LAD although both seem unlikely given relatively flat biomarkers
   post-arrest.  Scar mediated VT/VF is a possibility.  Currently, most
   likely in cardiogenic shock s/p arrest with improving hemodynamics on
   arrival.  Nothing by history to suggest another etiology for arrest
   although cannot exclude the possibility.
   - pt off of pressors; continue to monitor BP
   - ICD placement if MS improves. [**Month (only) 51**] also consider cardiac cath in
   future with ?  reperfusible injury.
   - If deteriorates clinically would consider cath urgently.
   .
   Hypertension: Initially admitted for cardiogenic shock however
   currently hypertensive. Enalapril was hold due to renal function
   depressed.
   Increase carvedilol, restart low dose ace (lisinopril 5)
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt is oriented to person and place only.  Pt
   baseline not entirely clear.  Possibly etiologies could include
   infection versus neurologic effects from patient
s recent cardiac
   arrest.  No clear signs of infection, although pt does have a cough on
   exam.
   - CXR unremarkable, no leukoctosis. Unable to get sputum as pt can
   expectorate.
   - CT Head
prelim read negative. f/u if any mention anoxic brain injury
   in final read.
   - Ucx/Blood Cx pending
   - follow neuro status
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for airway protection.  High
   peak pressures on the vent, with relatively small tidal volumes.  CXR
   unimpressive, and oxygenating well.  Pt is now s/p extubation and
   satting well.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   .
   # CORONARIES: 2 vessel CAD with DES in RCA.  Plan as outlined above.
   - Aspirin
   - Plavix
   - Heparin gtt restarted now that INR <2
   - Continue statin.
   .
   # PUMP/Valves:
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - f/u final read of echo
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm.  Monitor on tele.
   - Will need ICD for secondary prevention
   - f/u additional EP recs
   .
   # Diabetes: Finger sticks have improved to normal range.  Does not
   require insulin at home but poorly controlled on oral agents.
   - hold metformin.
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   - continue fingersticks
   .
   # LV Thrombus:
   - No e/o thrombus on repeat echo's, and ? need to continue coumadin
   long-term
   - Supratherapeutic INR likely [**3-16**] coumadin at home with superimposed
   portion from liver failure.
   - Now that INR<2, heparin gtt started
   .
   # Liver Injury: Likely shock liver. Improving.
   - Trend enzymes
   .
   # Renal Failure: Likely ATN. Renal function improving.
   - I/O
   - foley catheter
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely [**3-16**] arrest. Resolved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%. He experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which led to cardiogenic shock. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock/Arrest: The patient had VF with evidence of VT throughout the arrest. ACLS treatment was initiated, and the initial rhythm appears to be VF with e/o VT. Scar-mediated VT/VF is a possibility, and the patient is currently in cardiogenic shock but with improving hemodynamics on arrival. 
   - Continue to monitor blood pressure and remove all pressors if possible.
   - Consider ICD placement if myocardial systolic function improves.
   - Also, consider cardiac catheterization in the future with a question of reperfusible injury.
   - If the patient's condition deteriorates clinically, consider cath urgently.

2. Hypertension: The patient was initially admitted for cardiogenic shock but is currently hypertensive. Enalapril was withheld due to depressed renal function.
   - Increase carvedilol and restart low-dose ace inhibitor (lisinopril 5 mg).

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is oriented to person and place but not to time. Possible etiologies include infection versus neurologic effects from the recent cardiac"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15% who presented with ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest and was transferred with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) treatment during the arrest and is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent VT/VF arrest, there is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias, heart failure, or further deterioration in cardiac function.
2. Neurological complications: The patient has shown deficits in memory and following complex commands, which may be related to the recent cardiac arrest. There is a possibility of ongoing neurological impairment or delayed recovery.
3. Infection: Although the infectious work-up has been negative to date, the patient remains at risk for developing infections due to his hospital stay and potential immunosuppression.
4. Liver injury: The patient has evidence of liver injury, likely secondary to shock or medication use. Close monitoring of liver enzymes is essential, and any further deterioration should be promptly addressed.
5. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, suggesting renal impairment. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or other causes. Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly is crucial."
