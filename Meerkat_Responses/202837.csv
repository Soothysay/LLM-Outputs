 TRANS ESOPHAGEAL ECHO - At [**2102-11-28**] 01:00 PM
 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2102-11-28**] 05:00 PM
   ECHO done to eval heart function, showed a dilated RV with severe right
   ventricular systolic dysfunction.  CK and Trop + with normal MB.  Cards
   was consulted and beleive his troponin leak is [**2-6**] demand ischemia.
   Dilated RV raised concern for PE.  Patient had CTA done at OSH prior to
   transfer which per report was negative for PE.  Film uploaded into our
   system, and radiology was called and confirmed no PE on the OSH film.
   During bronchoscopy patient developed hypoxia to 70s and hypotension to
   60s.  Levophed increased.  2nd episode ocurred in the early evening.
   Patient became transiently hypoxic and dropped his pressures to SBP of
   80s.  Levophed chnaged to Neo and Vasopressin added.  Neo was then
   titrated off given right ventricular failure and Levo was added again.
   1L IVF bolus was given.
   3rd episdoe of hypoxia/hypotension ocurred around midnight.  Patient
   was desynchronous with the vent and this was thought to be the cause of
   his hypoxic event.  Sedation was changed from Fentanyl/Versed to
   Fentanyl/Propofol.  Patient seems more comfortable now.  FiO2 has now
   been weaned from 80% to 50%.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He was admitted with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. 

The patient underwent an arterial line placement, transesophageal echocardiogram, and bronchoscopy. The echocardiogram showed a dilated right ventricle with severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Cardiac enzymes were elevated, suggesting myocardial injury. The patient's troponin leak is estimated to be between 2-6%, indicating demand ischemia. 

During the bronchoscopy procedure, the patient developed hypoxia and hypotension, which required increasing the use of vasopressors. The patient's condition further deteriorated, leading to transient hypoxia and a drop in blood pressure. Sedation was changed from fentanyl/versed to fentanyl/propropofol, which seemed to improve the patient's comfort level. FiO2 was weaned from 80% to 50%. 

The patient has a history of sulfa allergy. He received antibiotics including levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/64 mmHg to 85/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute,"

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to multilobar
   pneumonia, bacterial vs. viral. There may be a component of fluid
   overload given acute worsening after 1L IV fluids and 1u PRBCs.
   Differential includes MI, TRALI, and PE. 1mm lateral ST segment
   depressions seen in OSH likely secondary to demand ischemia. PE less
   likely given infiltrates on CXR.
   -repeat CXR
   -ABG, wean current vent settings
   -increase sedation given autopeep and obstructive physiology
   -Vanc, Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone for Community acquired pneumonia
   -f/u urine legionella Antigen
   -Bronch today: send for mycoplasma, legionella
   -send putum cultures
   -obtain influenza Ag
   -Tamiflu empirically
   -consider diuresis if hemodynamically stable in the AM
   -combivent PRN wheezing
   -start IV solumedrol
   -rule out MI with CEs
   -repeat EKG
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient initially hypertensive in the ED to 200s,
   requiring nitro gtt, and large amounts of sedation after intubation.
   Subsequently hypotensive on dopamine and levophed. Given that patient
   has been afebrile without leukocytosis, this is less likely sepsis.
   However, CXR shows multilobar pneumonia.
   -blood cultures -from subclavian, and peripherally
   -UA, urine culture
   -repeat CXR
   -titrate sedation to comfort on the vent
   -wean pressors -tolerating MAPs>60
   -obtain echo today
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1, upto 2.1 prior to transfer. [**Month (only) 51**]
   be ATN given hypotension vs. contrast induced nephropathy.
   -obtain urine lytes
   -500cc IV fluid bolus
   -obtain urine lytes
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs.
   -daily HCTs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF), and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This may be secondary to multilobar pneumonia, bacterial or viral etiology, possibly exacerbated by fluid overload.
2. Myocardial infarction (MI): The patient has ST segment depressions in OSH, indicating possible demand ischemia.
3. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI): Differential diagnosis includes TRALI due to recent blood transfusion.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Less likely given infiltrates on chest X-ray, but PE should still be considered as a potential complication.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.1, which has increased to 2.1 prior to transfer. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or contrast-induced nephropathy.
6. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing"

 TRANS ESOPHAGEAL ECHO - At [**2102-11-28**] 01:00 PM
 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2102-11-28**] 05:00 PM
   ECHO done to eval heart function, showed a dilated RV with severe right
   ventricular systolic dysfunction.  CK and Trop + with normal MB.  Cards
   was consulted and beleive his troponin leak is [**2-6**] demand ischemia.
   Dilated RV raised concern for PE.  Patient had CTA done at OSH prior to
   transfer which per report was negative for PE.  Film uploaded into our
   system, and radiology was called and confirmed no PE on the OSH film.
   During bronchoscopy patient developed hypoxia to 70s and hypotension to
   60s.  Levophed increased.  2nd episode ocurred in the early evening.
   Patient became transiently hypoxic and dropped his pressures to SBP of
   80s.  Levophed chnaged to Neo and Vasopressin added.  Neo was then
   titrated off given right ventricular failure and Levo was added again.
   1L IVF bolus was given.
   3rd episdoe of hypoxia/hypotension ocurred around midnight.  Patient
   was desynchronous with the vent and this was thought to be the cause of
   his hypoxic event.  Sedation was changed from Fentanyl/Versed to
   Fentanyl/Propofol.  Patient seems more comfortable now.  FiO2 has now
   been weaned from 80% to 50%.

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to multilobar
   pneumonia, bacterial vs. viral. There may be a component of fluid
   overload given acute worsening after 1L IV fluids and 1u PRBCs.
   Differential includes MI, TRALI, and PE. 1mm lateral ST segment
   depressions seen in OSH likely secondary to demand ischemia. PE less
   likely given infiltrates on CXR.
   -repeat CXR
   -ABG, wean current vent settings; consider paralysis
   -increase sedation given autopeep and obstructive physiology
   -Vanc, Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone for Community acquired pneumonia, d2
   of week long
   -repeat influenza; Tamiflu empirically
   -combivent standing
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient initially hypertensive in the ED to 200s,
   requiring nitro gtt, and large amounts of sedation after intubation.
   Subsequently hypotensive on dopamine and levophed. Given that patient
   has been afebrile without leukocytosis, this is less likely sepsis.
   However, CXR shows multilobar pneumonia.
   - likely closely tied to RV pathology which could be a consequnce of
   pulmonay pathology vs primary cardiac process
   -blood cultures -from subclavian, and peripherally; replace line
   -UA, urine culture
   -repeat CXR
   -titrate sedation to comfort on the vent
   -wean pressors -tolerating MAPs>60
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1, upto 1.5. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN given
   hypotension vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Could also be product of
   RV pathology
   -obtain urine lytes
   -bolus prn
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs.
   -daily HCTs

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to multilobar
   pneumonia, bacterial vs. viral.  Chest CT/CXR more consistent with
   viral process.  PE r/o on CT. TRALI is a possibility. Likely has COPD
   flare.
   - Vanc, Levofloxacin, CTX for CAP
   - Tamiflu and droplet precautions
   - F/U bronch results
   - F/U urine legionella, mycoplasm Ag, and blood/urine cultures
   - Combivent for COPD exacerbation
   - More comfortable on vent with propofol.
   # Hypotension: Initially hypertensive requiring nitro gtt, now
   hypotensive on levo (dopa weaned off overnight).  Likely due to sepis
   and sedation.  Also concerned for autopeep causing obstructive
   hypotension (given high CVP and low UOP) and cardiac etiology given
   history of CAD/CHF.  Evidence of severe RV dysfunction on TTE, but does
   not appear volume overloaded.
   - Wean Levo/vasopressin to keep MAP > 60
   - F/U cultures as above
   - Titrate propofol to keep comfortable and decreased autopeep
   # RV dysfunction: Likely acute on chronic failure [**2-6**] old RV infarct
   and chronic lung disease. No evidence of PE on CT (OSH study
   interpreted by our radiologists)
   - No evidence of volume overload
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1, now 2.1 in setting of sepsis,
   hypotension and receiving contrast dye.
   - Urine lytes
   - Follow UOP with IVF/pressors
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs. Still 27.5. No
   evidence of active bleeding.
   - Seriel hcts
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   # Afib: Currently in afib, rate controlled in the 80s.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dyspnea, hypoxemic respiratory failure, chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with multilobar pneumonia, severe right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, positive troponin T, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has experienced several episodes of hypoxia, hypotension, and bradycardia overnight. The initial hypertension has been managed with nitroglycerin, and the patient is now hypotensive on levo. There is concern for sepsis and sedation contributing to the hypotension, as well as potential autopeep causing obstructive hypotension and cardiac etiology given the history of CAD/CHF. Severe RV dysfunction is present on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), but the patient does not appear volume overloaded.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated from baseline creatinine (Cr) 1.1 to 2.1 in the setting of sepsis, hypotension, and receiving contrast dye.

Other assessments include anemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of CAD s/p CABG. The patient is being treated with various medications and interventions, including"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and being treated for multilobar pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, RV dysfunction, acute renal failure, anemia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is also being treated for coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's condition can worsen if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not adequately addressed, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low, and if not managed properly, it can result in inadequate perfusion of vital organs, potentially leading to organ damage or failure.
3. RV dysfunction: Severe right ventricular dysfunction can lead to cardiovascular collapse if not promptly treated. Continuous monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support are necessary.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dCHF, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This is likely secondary to multilobar pneumonia, bacterial vs. viral. There may be a component of fluid overload given acute worsening after 1L IV fluids and 1u PRBCs. Differential includes myocardial infarction (MI), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and pulmonary embolism (PE).

2. Hypotension: The patient initially had high blood pressure in the emergency department requiring nitroglycerin and large amounts of sedation after intubation. Subsequently, the patient was hypotensive on dopamine and levophed. Given that the patient has been afebrile without leukocytosis, this is less likely sepsis. However, the presence of multilobar pneumonia on the chest X-ray suggests that the hypotension is closely tied to right ventricular (RV) pathology, which could be a consequence of pulmonary pathology or a primary cardiac process.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.1, which increased to 1.5. It is unclear whether this"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting. He presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, multilobar pneumonia, and anemia.

The patient initially had hypertension but later became hypotensive, requiring dopamine and levophed. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition worsened, leading to the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to progressive oliguric renal failure with a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0.5. He also developed worsening metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.15 and required paralysis with cisatracurium due to vent dysynchrony. Oxygenation improved after the administration of neo for pressors.

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, cisatracurium, phenylephrine, and propofol. He has also been given vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza testing and treatment with Tamiflu have been initiated.

   bacterial, but GPCs growing in sputum. There may be a component of
   fluid overload given acute worsening after 1L IV fluids and 1u PRBCs.
   Differential includes MI, TRALI, and PE. 1mm lateral ST segment
   depressions seen in OSH likely secondary to demand ischemia. PE less

   requiring nitro gtt, and large amounts of sedation after intubation.
   Subsequently hypotensive on dopamine and levophed.  Dopamine weaned off

   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1, up to over 3 today. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN
   given hypotension vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Could also be

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (acute renal failure/ATN vs. contrast-induced nephropathy), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, multilobar pneumonia (likely bacterial vs. viral), and right ventricular (RV) failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to multilobar pneumonia. This may be caused by bacterial or viral infection, and there may also be a component of fluid overload given the acute worsening after receiving intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypertensive in the emergency department but subsequently became hypotensive, requiring dopamine and levophed. This hypotension is likely due to right heart failure, which could be a consequence of pulmonary pathology or a primary cardiac process. Blood cultures have been negative, and urine cultures have also been negative."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by H1N1 infection. The patient is intubated, sedated, and paralyzed. He has been receiving multiple medications and treatments for various conditions, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure with low oxygen levels in the blood. This may be due to an infectious cause, possibly viral or atypical pneumonia. Further investigations, such as RT-PCR for H1N1, are planned.

2. Right Heart Failure (RHF): The patient shows signs of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, possibly due to acute pulmonary embolism or acute right heart strain. There is evidence of RV dilation and mild troponin leak. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and adjustments to fluid management and vasopressor weaning are being considered.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT"

   likely viral vs atypical PNA..  Afebrile.
   -GPCs on gram stain from BAL but no growth (albeit on antibiotics).
   -Cont osteltamavir, currently dose adjusted for renal failure.
   -BAL to be set to state lab for RT-PCR for H1N1
   -Cont course x8days.
   -Plan to continue ARDSnet ventilation, and decrease PEEP to hit ARDSnet
   weaning goals.
   - Will continue paralytics today given overnight events, and hope to

      Fluid off with CVVH.
   2. R heart failure- Unclear etiology. Neg for PE.  No evid of RV
   infarct per cardiology.  Seems likely [**2-6**] hypoxic pulmonary

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib) on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a suspected H1N1 infection. The patient is intubated, sedated, and paralyzed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is being treated with oseltamivir, adjusted for renal failure, and BAL cultures are pending for RT-PCR for H1N1. The patient will continue ARDSnet ventilation and decrease PEEP to hit ARDSnet weaning goals.

The patient also has right heart failure, likely secondary to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, with evidence of right ventricular (RV) dilation and bowing of the interventricular septum c/w volume overload. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a suspected H1N1 infection. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, requiring multi-lumen catheter placement, paralyzed with cisatracurium, sedated with midazolam, and ventilated on ARDSnet mode with decreased PEEP for weaning goals. He is on vasopressor support but had a decrease in requirement. The patient's recent events include the start and stop of multi-lumen catheter placement, experiencing tachycardia, hypertension, increased respiratory rate, and elevated pCO2. He also had a myocardial infarction (MI), acute renal failure (ARF), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure - due to the patient's suspected H1N1 infection and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Right heart failure - due to the patient's history of CHF and ongoing ischemia.
3. Acute renal failure - due to the patient's history of CHF, ongoing ischemia, and potential use"

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient with multilobar pneumonia,
   bacterial vs. viral (H1N1).  Some component of edema.  Unlikely MI,
   TRALI, or PE. 1mm lateral ST segment depressions seen in OSH likely
   secondary to demand ischemia.   Oxygenation has improved with
   paralysis.
   - trial of weaning paralytics
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - continue diuresis -50 cc/hr keeping CVP > 10, tolerating neo as
   needed
   - peep at 10 this morning, will try to decrease
   -Vanc, Levofloxacin for pneumonia for 7 days from [**11-28**].  D/c
   ceftriaxone as more likely GPC PNA
   -Tamiflu
   -combivent standing
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient initially hypertensive in the ED to 200s,
   requiring nitro gtt, and large amounts of sedation after intubation.
   Subsequently hypotensive on dopamine and levophed.  Dopamine weaned off
   but levophed still required.  Likely all secondary to R heart failure.
   Patient likely very sensitive to CVP given RV dysfunction.
   - pressors as needed for MAPs>60
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 10 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1, up to over 3 today. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN
   given hypotension vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Started on CVVH.
   - continue CVVH with goal of negative 50 cc/hr
   - continue to follow acidosis, is likely all non-compensated metabolic
   as his pCO2 are normal
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs.
   -hct today 22; will receive 1 u PRBCs today for goal of hct btw 25 and
   30 as trop still trending upward
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib, rate controlled in the 80s.
   -rate: hold metoprolol given current pressor requirement.
   - discuss with EP about increasing pacing rate
   -anticoagulation: f/u INR. Consider coumadin if INR < 3.0.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   -ROMI; CK going down but trop still trending up; expected in renal
   failure
   -repeat EKG
   -continue ASA, statin
   -hold BB in the setting of hypotension
   - per cards, RV pathology could be RV infarct but likely not acute

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

Based on the assessment, the patient has several medical complications. These include:

1. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient has evidence of ischemia on the EKG and elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating an acute myocardial infarction.

2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has multilobar pneumonia, bacterial versus viral (H1N1), which is causing respiratory failure. Oxygenation has improved with paralysis.

3. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.1, but it has increased to over 3 today. This suggests acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy.

4. Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient has severe sepsis with evidence of organ dysfunction, including respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular involvement.

The plan includes:
- Continue CVVH with goal of negative 50 cc/hr.
- Wean vent as tolerated.
- Continue di"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dilated congestive heart failure (dCHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was found to have multilobar pneumonia, likely secondary to bacterial infection.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. These include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to multilobar pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation with paralysis.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypertension but later became hypotensive, requiring vasopressor support. This hypotension is likely secondary to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.1, which has increased to over 3 today. This acute renal failure could be due to either hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) on admission was 27%. He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is currently on various medications including midazolam, cisatracurium, fentanyl, heparin sodium, KCl (CRRT), calcium gluconate (CRRT), propofol, and phenylephrine.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 93/47 to 176/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 9,328 mL and a total output of 1,585 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 7,743 mL. Urine output is 385 mL, NG output is 350 mL, and stool output is not mentioned. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 430 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)"

   Event Note:  This morning the patient was noted to have a cuff leak and
   dropping tidal volumes.  RT was able to restore ETT seal via mild
   lateral pressure.  The airway cart was brought into the room and the
   bronchoscope passed into the ETT.  The tube was noted to be seated
   against the tracheal wall, beyond the level of the vocal cords.  The
   carina was identified and the ETT advanced into position 3cm above the
   carina.  The bronchoscope was easily removed.  The patient

   Assessment and Plan:
   Impression: 67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD
   s/p CABG presents with dyspnea, a/w hypoxemic respiratory failure in
   the setting of recent suspected H1N1 infection, c/b multiple episodes
   of hypotension in the setting of vent dyssynchrony.
   1.Hypoxemic respiratory failure - likely infectious but differential
   for multifocal infitlrates in this setting is relatively [**Name2 (NI) **].  Most
   likely viral vs atypical PNA..  Afebrile.
   -GPCs on gram stain from BAL but no growth (albeit on antibiotics).
   -Cont osteltamavir, currently dose adjusted for renal failure.
   -BAL sent to state lab for RT-PCR for H1N1
   -Cont course x8 days vancomycin and levofloxacin.
   -D/c CTX.
   -Plan to continue ARDSnet ventilation, and decrease PEEP to hit ARDSnet
   weaning goals.
   - Attempt to wean paralytics.
   2. Shock
 likely [**2-6**] sepsis.  Unclear source, but GPCs in sputum as
   noted.  Pressor requirement dramatically decreased.
   2. R heart failure- Unclear etiology. Neg for PE.  No evid of RV
   infarct per cardiology.  Seems likely [**2-6**] hypoxic pulmonary
   vasoconstriction.  RV dilation in the setting of PASP 45 most c/w acute
   event.  Continues to have mild Tn leak.  No improvement in hemodynamics
   w/ inc CVP to 15-20 on [**11-29**].  Prior TTE additionally notable for
   bowing of the septum c/w volume overload.  Given these limitation,
   would recommned CVP goal [**10-19**] on CVVH.
   3. ARF
 Started on CVVH, will hold on further attempts at negative
   fluid balance while weaning paralytics.
   4. Anemia- Goal 25-30 given ongoing ischemia.
   5. PAF
 HR in nl range currently.  Improved on neo.

He presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a recent suspected H1N1 infection. 

24-hour events:
- The patient had a cuff leak and dropping tidal volumes, but the respiratory therapist was able to restore endotracheal tube (ETT) seal via mild lateral pressure.
- The airway cart was brought into the room, and the bronchoscope was passed into the ETT.
- The tube was noted to be seated against the tracheal wall, beyond the level of the vocal cords.
- The carina was identified, and the ETT was advanced into position 3 cm above the carina.
- The bronchoscope was easily removed. The patient's oxygen saturations remained at 100% throughout the procedure, and the tidal volume (Vt) was restored to the set volume of 430 cc.

Allergies: Sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), unknown.

   Assessment and Plan:
   Impression: 67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD
   s/p CABG presents with dyspnea, a/w hypoxemic respiratory failure in
   the setting of recent suspected H1N1 infection, c/b multiple episodes
   of hypotension in the setting of vent dyssynchrony.
   1.Hypoxemic respiratory failure - likely infectious but differential
   for multifocal infitlrates in this setting is relatively [**Name2 (NI) **].  Most
   likely viral vs atypical PNA..  Afebrile.
   -GPCs on gram stain from BAL but no growth (albeit on antibiotics).
   -Cont osteltamavir, currently dose adjusted for renal failure.
   -BAL sent to state lab for RT-PCR for H1N1
   -Cont course x8 days vancomycin and levofloxacin.
   -D/c CTX.
   -Plan to continue ARDSnet ventilation, and decrease PEEP to hit ARDSnet
   weaning goals.
   - Attempt to wean paralytics.
   2. Shock
 likely [**2-6**] sepsis.  Unclear source, but GPCs in sputum as
   noted.  Pressor requirement dramatically decreased.
   2. R heart failure- Unclear etiology. Neg for PE.  No evid of RV
   infarct per cardiology.  Seems likely [**2-6**] hypoxic pulmonary
   vasoconstriction.  RV dilation in the setting of PASP 45 most c/w acute
   event.  Continues to have mild Tn leak.  No improvement in hemodynamics
   w/ inc CVP to 15-20 on [**11-29**].  Prior TTE additionally notable for
   bowing of the septum c/w volume overload.  Given these limitation,
   would recommned CVP goal [**10-19**] on CVVH.
   3. ARF
 Started on CVVH, will hold on further attempts at negative
   fluid balance while weaning paralytics.
   4. Anemia- Goal 25-30 given ongoing ischemia.
   5. PAF
 HR in nl range currently.  Improved on neo.

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8860**], whose note above reflects
   my input.  Overall, has made some progress from a respiratory failure
   standpoint, with PEEP down to 12 and FiO2 down to 50%.  On paralysis,
   has had no further episodes of hypoxemia/dyssynchrony leading to
   hypotension.  On [**Last Name (STitle) **]-spectrum oseltamivir for possible influenza, and
   vanco/levoflox for possible CAP.  Will follow cultures and continue
   present rx.  Maintain on ARDSnet ventilation.  Will attempt to remove
   pharmacologic paralysis today. Continue CRRT for ARF.   Other issues as
   per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8860**] and the ICU team note from today.  Critically ill: 30

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dCHF, COPD, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a recent suspected H1N1 infection.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has had multiple episodes of hypotension due to vent dyssynchrony. He is also experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is indicated by the need for ARDSnet ventilation and a low tidal volume strategy.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with signs of right heart failure. There is evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular (RV) dilation on echocardiography. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level.

The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but he has mild hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. His white blood cell count is slightly elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing oseltamivir for possible influenza, vancomycin and levofloxacin for possible community-acquired pneumonia, and maintaining ARDSnet ventilation. The goal is to wean off the paralytics and attempt to remove them. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is being continued for acute renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a recent suspected H1N1 infection. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. 

24-hour events include a cuff leak and dropping tidal volumes, which were addressed by advancing the endotracheal tube (ETT) position. The patient's oxygen saturations remained at 100% throughout the procedure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 93/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and paralyzed.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 101 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.79. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a suspected H1N1 infection.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has experienced episodes of hypotension. He is also receiving dialysis through a catheter. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 93/47 to 176/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, with an endotracheal tube in place. His lungs are clear bilaterally, and there is no evidence of rashes or skin changes. Neurologically, the patient is paralyzed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin-T levels. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal ranges.

   likely viral vs atypical PNA..  Afebrile.
   -GPCs on gram stain from BAL but no growth (albeit on antibiotics).
   -Cont osteltamavir, currently dose adjusted for renal failure.
   -BAL to be set to state lab for RT-PCR for H1N1
   -Cont course x8days.
   -Plan to continue ARDSnet ventilation, and decrease PEEP to hit ARDSnet
   weaning goals.
   - Will continue paralytics today given overnight events, and hope to
   try and wean tomorrow in setting of getting
      Fluid off with CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and intubated in the ICU. They have a history of allergies to sulfa medications and are currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), cisatracurium, propofol, KCl (CRRT), and midazolam. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 93/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. 

The patient's physical examination reveals irregularly irregular heart sounds, accentuated P2, and bilateral rhonchi anteriorly. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T level. The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute renal failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure - likely infectious but differential for multifocal infiltrates in this setting is relatively low. Most likely viral vs atypical PNA. The patient is being treated with oseltamivir, currently dose-adjusted for renal failure. BAL will be sent to the state lab for RT-PCR for H1N1.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress includes:

- The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure. The specific type of myocardial infarction (STEMI, NSTEMI) is not mentioned.
- The patient also has acute renal failure and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.
- The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure (hypotension), increased heart rate (tachycardia), and decreased urine output.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a ventilator, receiving oxygen and having controlled respiratory rates.
- The patient has several lines and catheters inserted, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, dialysis catheter, and others.
- The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in various parameters such as white blood cell count, creatinine levels, potassium levels, and liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The acute respiratory failure could progress to more severe conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not properly managed.
3. Renal complications: Acute renal failure may lead to chronic kidney disease or require long-term dialysis.

   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient with multilobar pneumonia,
   bacterial vs. viral (H1N1).  Some component of edema.  Unlikely MI,
   TRALI, or PE. 1mm lateral ST segment depressions seen in OSH likely
   secondary to demand ischemia.   Oxygenation has improved with
   paralysis.
   - trial of weaning paralytics
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - continue diuresis -50 cc/hr keeping CVP > 10, tolerating neo as
   needed
   - peep at 10 this morning, will try to decrease
   -Vanc, Levofloxacin for pneumonia for 7 days from [**11-28**].  D/c
   ceftriaxone as more likely GPC PNA
   -Tamiflu
   -combivent standing

   # Hypotension: Patient initially hypertensive in the ED to 200s,
   requiring nitro gtt, and large amounts of sedation after intubation.
   Subsequently hypotensive on dopamine and levophed.  Dopamine weaned off
   but levophed still required.  Likely all secondary to R heart failure.
   Patient likely very sensitive to CVP given RV dysfunction.
   - pressors as needed for MAPs>60
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 10 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1, up to over 3 today. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN
   given hypotension vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Started on CVVH.
   - continue CVVH with goal of negative 50 cc/hr
   - continue to follow acidosis, is likely all non-compensated metabolic
   as his pCO2 are normal
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs.
   -hct today 22; will receive 1 u PRBCs today for goal of hct btw 25 and
   30 as trop still trending upward
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib, rate controlled in the 80s.
   -rate: hold metoprolol given current pressor requirement.
   - discuss with EP about increasing pacing rate
   -anticoagulation: f/u INR. Consider coumadin if INR < 3.0.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   -ROMI; CK going down but trop still trending up; expected in renal
   failure
   -repeat EKG
   -continue ASA, statin
   -hold BB in the setting of hypotension
   - per cards, RV pathology could be RV infarct but likely not acute

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be secondary to multilobar pneumonia. However, it is now considered more likely to be due to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE) given the absence of myocardial infarction (MI), tension pneumothorax (TRALI), or pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's initial blood pressure was in the 200s and required nitroglycerin and large amounts of sedation after intubation. Subsequently, the patient became hypotensive on dopamine and levophed, likely due to right ventricular (RV) failure. Dopamine was weaned off but levophed is still required.

The patient developed acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine (Cr) of 1.1, rising to over 3 today. The attending physician suspects either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been initiated with a goal of negative 50 cc/hr.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute. He is also receiving various medications through infusions, including phenylephrine, heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), fentanyl, midazolam (versed), propofol, KCl (CRRT), and diltiazem.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 166/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 94.2 kg, and his height is 67 inches. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, and fluid balance shows a total input of 4,471 mL and output of 5,324 mL since midnight, with a negative balance of -853 mL.

The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, HCO3 of 106 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His arterial blood gas values indicate a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 212.

Physical examination findings are not available due to the patient being intubated and unresponsive. Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 18,000 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.7 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 86 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 5.1 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) at 129 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 21 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) at 8.1 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 2.0 mg/dL, phosphorus (PO4) at 3.7 mg/dL, and lactate at 1.3 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's current medical conditions include myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is being treated in the ICU with appropriate care measures, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and administration of antibiotics."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia, likely bacterial or viral (H1N1). There are also components of edema, making it unlikely to be myocardial infarction (MI), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), or pulmonary embolism (PE).

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation improved with paralysis, which suggests that the respiratory failure may be secondary to increased work of breathing. The pneumonia is being treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin for 7 days.

2. Hypotension: The patient initially had hypertension in the emergency department, requiring nitroglycerin and large amounts of sedation after intubation. He then became hypotensive on dopamine and levophed. The hypotension is likely due to right ventricular (RV) failure and high pulmonary vascular resistance. Pressors are being used as needed to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.1, but it increased to"

   Critical Care Attending:
   Patient with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, CHF (diastolic,
   LV; systolic RV). Pressors have been gradually reduced. FIO2 now down
   to 0.5; still being vented with low VT per ARDSnet. Started on CVVH for
   acute renal failure.  Echo showed evidence of RV pressure overload with
   bowing of septum. Attempt made to reduce fluids, which has led to drops
   in BP.
   On exam, patient intubated and sedated. Unresponsive. Heart sounds are
   very soft. No tricuspid regurgitation noted. Lungs clear anteriorally
   and laterally. Abdomen distended with few bowel sounds. Non tender.
   Extremities warm and well pefurfused. Trace edema.
   The fact that patient shows evidence on exam of good peripheral
   perfusion argues against low output shock due to RV dysfunction and
   more for redistributive shock from sepsis; the fact that there is
   minimal TR on echo also argues against grossly dilated RV. Would add
   vasopressin. Urine output has been variable on CVVH. Patient still has
   high minute ventilation requirements consistent with large dead space.
   Continues on anti-virals and anti-biotics for pneumonia. Will add
   better gram negative coverage. Will begin to come down on PEEP given
   excellent oxygenation and marginal hemodynamics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a suspected H1N1 infection. The patient is critically ill, intubated, and sedated. He has multiple medical complications including shock, right heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, anemia, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely infectious, but there is a differential diagnosis for multifocal infiltrates. Viral infection or atypical pneumonia should be considered. The patient is already receiving antiviral therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, which may be due to an unidentified source of infection. The pressor requirement has decreased, but there is a possibility of right ventricular (RV) failure.
3. Right heart failure: The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure, including an R axis shift on the ECG and evidence of RV dilation. This could be secondary to pulmonary hypertension or acute events.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient is undergoing"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a suspected H1N1 infection.

The patient has been sedated and intubated. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 430 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35°C (95°F), heart rate (HR) of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 157/77 mmHg to 166/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including dCHF, COPD, and atrial fibrillation. He is on several medications, including coumadin, diltiazem, pantoprazole, and various antibiotics.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.2 g/dL, elevated troponin-T level of 0.89, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 506 IU/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, shock likely secondary to sepsis, right heart failure, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be infectious in nature, possibly due to a viral or atypical pneumonia. The presence of multilocular infiltrates on imaging could indicate a more severe form of viral infection or an alternative diagnosis such as ARDS.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, characterized by persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. The source of infection remains unclear, but gram-positive cocci (GPCs) have been identified in the sputum. The pressor requirement has decreased, but the patient may still be experiencing right ventricular (RV) failure, especially considering the tachycardia observed this morning.

3. Right heart failure: The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure, evidenced by an R-axis shift on the admit ECG and a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of 45 mmHg"

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient with multilobar pneumonia,
   bacterial vs. viral (H1N1).  Some component of edema.  Unlikely MI,
   TRALI, or PE. 1mm lateral ST segment depressions seen in OSH likely
   secondary to demand ischemia.   OxygenatioN improved with paralysis
   which have been discontinued.
   - continue diuresis -50 cc/hr keeping CVP > 10, wean neo as tolerated
   - peep at 12 this morning, will try to decrease
   -Vanc, Levofloxacin for pneumonia for 7 days from [**11-28**].  D/c
   ceftriaxone as more likely GPC PNA
   -Tamiflu at renally adjusted treatment dose; could consider peramivir
   - consider NO for pulm vasodilation and better forward flow if BP
   decompensates again1
   -combivent standing
   - DFAs all undeterminate, awiating culture
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient initially hypertensive in the ED to 200s,
   requiring nitro gtt, and large amounts of sedation after intubation.
   Subsequently hypotensive on dopamine and levophed.  Dopamine weaned off
   but levophed still required.  Likely all secondary to R heart failure/
   high pulm vascular resistance. .
   - pressors as needed for MAPs>60
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 10 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1, up to over 3 today. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN
   given hypotension vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Started on CVVH.
   - continue CVVH with goal of negative 50 cc/hr
   - continue to follow acidosis, is likely all non-compensated metabolic
   as his pCO2 are normal
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs.
   - trend, daily sufficient
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib, avg heart rate with wide variation 70s to
   120s.
   -rate: hold metoprolol given current pressor requirement.
   -anticoagulation: coumadin on hold, heparin drip w/ low goal PTT 40-60
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   -ROMI; CK trending down; likely a product of demand and wall stress
   over ACS
   -serial EKG (tracings so far c/w RV strain)
   -continue ASA, statin
   -hold BB in the setting of hypotension
   - per cards, RV pathology could be RV infarct but likely not acute

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), multilobar pneumonia (bacterial vs. viral), and right ventricular failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to multilobar pneumonia, possibly caused by a bacterial or viral infection. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in further respiratory distress or even respiratory arrest if not properly managed.

2. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient has been diagnosed with AMI, which may have contributed to his current condition. Complications related to AMI include arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or myocardial rupture.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has developed acute renal failure, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). ARF can worsen the patient's overall prognosis and increase the risk of complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and infection.

4. Severe Sepsis: The patient has severe se"

- The patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications including myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.
- The patient is on cardiovascular hemofiltration (CVVH) with a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of at least 10 due to preload dependency.
- The patient's PEEP and FiO2 have been weaned to 8 cmH2O and 50%, respectively.
- Vasopressin has been started to wean other pressors.
- Cardiac enzymes have shown intermittent substantial elevations in CK-MB. The PTT of heparin drip has been raised from CVVH goal to acute care surgery (ACS) goal. The patient is already rate-controlled and on statin and ASA.
- Antibiotic coverage has been broadened from levofloxacin to cefepime + levofloxacin due to low-grade temperatures while on CVVH.
- Piramivir has been released from state.
- The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics).
- The patient received various infusions including phenylephrine, midazolam, vasopressin, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), heparin sodium, KCl (CRRT), and propofol"

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient with multilobar pneumonia,
   bacterial vs. viral (H1N1).  Some component of edema.  Unlikely MI,
   TRALI, or PE. 1mm lateral ST segment depressions seen in OSH likely
   secondary to demand ischemia.   OxygenatioN improved with paralysis
   which have been discontinued.
   - continue diuresis -50 cc/hr keeping CVP > 10, wean neo as tolerated
   - peep at 12 this morning, will try to decrease
   -Vanc, Levofloxacin for pneumonia for 7 days from [**11-28**].  D/c
   ceftriaxone as more likely GPC PNA
   -Tamiflu at renally adjusted treatment dose; could consider peramivir
   - consider NO for pulm vasodilation and better forward flow if BP
   decompensates again1
   -combivent standing
   - DFAs all undeterminate, awiating culture
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient initially hypertensive in the ED to 200s,
   requiring nitro gtt, and large amounts of sedation after intubation.
   Subsequently hypotensive on dopamine and levophed.  Dopamine weaned off
   but levophed still required.  Likely all secondary to R heart failure/
   high pulm vascular resistance. .
   - pressors as needed for MAPs>60
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 10 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1, up to over 3 today. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN
   given hypotension vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Started on CVVH.
   - continue CVVH with goal of negative 50 cc/hr
   - continue to follow acidosis, is likely all non-compensated metabolic
   as his pCO2 are normal
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs.
   - trend, daily sufficient
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib, avg heart rate with wide variation 70s to
   120s.
   -rate: hold metoprolol given current pressor requirement.
   -anticoagulation: coumadin on hold, heparin drip w/ low goal PTT 40-60
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   -ROMI; CK trending down; likely a product of demand and wall stress
   over ACS
   -serial EKG (tracings so far c/w RV strain)
   -continue ASA, statin
   -hold BB in the setting of hypotension
   - per cards, RV pathology could be RV infarct but likely not acute

The patient presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be secondary to pneumonia. However, it is now believed to be due to multilobar pneumonia with bacterial vs. viral etiology (H1N1). The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and a myocardial infarction (MI).

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), vasopressin, phenylephrine, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and propofol.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 142/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory"

   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient with multilobar pneumonia,
   bacterial vs. viral (H1N1).  Some component of edema.  Unlikely MI,
   TRALI, or PE. 1mm lateral ST segment depressions seen in OSH likely
   secondary to demand ischemia.   OxygenatioN improved with paralysis
   which have been discontinued. Weaned on vent from PEEP 12 to 8 over
   course of day yesterday.
   - continue diuresis -50 cc/hr keeping CVP > 10, wean neo as tolerated
   -Vanc, Levofloxacin for pneumonia for 7 days from [**11-28**].  D/c
   ceftriaxone as more likely GPC PNA
   -Tamiflu at renally adjusted treatment dose; could consider peramivir;
   virology still waiting for state lab results
   - consider NO for pulm vasodilation and better forward flow if BP
   decompensates again1
   -combivent standing
   - DFAs all undeterminate, awiating culture
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient initially hypertensive in the ED to 200s,
   requiring nitro gtt, and large amounts of sedation after intubation.
   Subsequently hypotensive on dopamine and levophed.  Now on levophed and
   vasopressin; will try to wean levophed first today.  Likely all
   secondary to R heart failure/ high pulm vascular resistance. .
   - pressors as needed for MAPs>60
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 10 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   .
   # CAD: having troponin leak and CK-MB peak at 40; likely is having
   ongoing ischemia based on these numbers.  Cardiology following along
   and appreciate recs.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from TEE cardioversion tomorrow to
   improve synchrony.
   - cont heparin at ACS PTT goals
   - consider plavix load and ? cath later this week
   - will keep NPO at MN for possible cardioversion tomorrow
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN given hypotension
   vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Started on CVVH.
   - continue CVVH with goal of negative 50 cc/hr
   - continue to follow acidosis, is likely all non-compensated metabolic
   as his pCO2 are normal
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs.
   - trend, daily sufficient
   - has been stable recently
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib, avg heart rate with wide variation 70s to
   120s.
   -rate: hold metoprolol given current pressor requirement.
   -anticoagulation: coumadin on hold, heparin drip w/ ACS dosing

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia, likely bacterial or viral (H1N1). He also has acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute renal failure (ARF), and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia with multilobar involvement, leading to respiratory failure. Oxygenation improved with paralysis, but he is still dependent on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.
2. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): The patient shows signs of ongoing ischemia with elevated troponin levels and a CK-MB peak at 40. Cardiology is following up, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) cardioversion is planned tomorrow to improve synchrony.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a baseline creatinine (Cr) of 1.1 and is likely experiencing either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or contrast-induced nephropathy. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CV"

    67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea, a/w hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting
   of recent suspected H1N1 infection, c/b multiple episodes of
   hypotension in the setting of vent dyssynchrony.
   1.Hypoxemic respiratory failure - likely infectious but differential
   for multifocal infitlrates in this setting is relatively [**Name2 (NI) **].  Most
   likely viral vs atypical PNA.. Expanded antibiotic coverage yesterday
   given low grade temp on CVVH.
   -GPCs on gram stain from BAL but no growth (albeit on antibiotics).
   Secretions thick, tan.
   -Vanc/levofloxacin/cefepime
   -Small/mod R pleural effusion (b/l but right larger).  If demonstrates
   other evidence of infection may need  to consider thoracentesis, but
   currently would be relatively high risk procedure due to size and PPV.
   -Cont osteltamavir, currently dose adjusted for renal failure/CVVH
   -BAL sent to state lab for RT-PCR for H1N1
   -Now on expanded abx course.  If continues to be febrile (relatively,
   on CVVH) and sputum non-diagnostic may need bronchoscopy.
   -Plan to continue ARDSnet ventilation, and decrease PEEP to hit ARDSnet
   weaning goals.
   -Yesterday, sedation weaned but didn
t wake up and became
   hemodynamically stable.  Will continue to attempt daily wake up, assess
   for NM weakness.
   2. Shock
 likely [**2-6**] sepsis.  Unclear source, but GPCs in sputum as
   noted.  Pressor requirement stable but possibly component of RV failure
   at this point.  Vasopressin added
   -  goal 25cc neg/h on CVVH.
   3. R heart failure- R axis shift on admit ECG.  Unclear etiology. Neg
   for PE.  No evid of RV infarct per cardiology.  Seems likely [**2-6**]
   hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.  RV dilation in the setting of PASP
   45 most c/w acute event  No improvement in hemodynamics w/ inc CVP to
   15-20 on [**11-29**].  Prior TTE additionally notable for bowing of the
   septum c/w volume overload.  Given these limitation, would recommend
   CVP goal [**10-19**] on CVVH. Ongoing +Tn concerning for mild demand
   ischemia.
   -attempt gentle CVVH diuresis to eliminate intraventricular dependence
   -consider inhaled pulmonary vasodilator, but has continued to make
   progress on vent.
   3. ARF
 On CVVH, will hold on further attempts at negative fluid
   balance while weaning paralytics.
   4. Anemia- Goal 25-30 given ongoing ischemia.
   5. PAF

   Assessment and Plan:
    67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea, a/w hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting
   of recent suspected H1N1 infection, c/b multiple episodes of
   hypotension in the setting of vent dyssynchrony.
   1.Hypoxemic respiratory failure - likely infectious but differential
   for multifocal infitlrates in this setting is relatively [**Name2 (NI) **].  Most
   likely viral vs atypical PNA.. Expanded antibiotic coverage yesterday
   given low grade temp on CVVH.
   -GPCs on gram stain from BAL but no growth (albeit on antibiotics).
   Secretions thick, tan.
   -Vanc/levofloxacin/cefepime
   -Small/mod R pleural effusion (b/l but right larger).  If demonstrates
   other evidence of infection may need  to consider thoracentesis, but
   currently would be relatively high risk procedure due to size and PPV.
   -Cont osteltamavir, currently dose adjusted for renal failure/CVVH
   -BAL sent to state lab for RT-PCR for H1N1
   -Now on expanded abx course.  If continues to be febrile (relatively,
   on CVVH) and sputum non-diagnostic may need bronchoscopy.
   -Plan to continue ARDSnet ventilation, and decrease PEEP to hit ARDSnet
   weaning goals.
   -Yesterday, sedation weaned but didn
t wake up and became
   hemodynamically stable.  Will continue to attempt daily wake up, assess
   for NM weakness.
   2. Shock
 likely [**2-6**] sepsis.  Unclear source, but GPCs in sputum as
   noted.  Pressor requirement stable but possibly component of RV failure
   at this point.  Vasopressin added
   -  goal 25cc neg/h on CVVH.
   3. R heart failure- R axis shift on admit ECG.  Unclear etiology. Neg
   for PE.  No evid of RV infarct per cardiology.  Seems likely [**2-6**]
   hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.  RV dilation in the setting of PASP
   45 most c/w acute event  No improvement in hemodynamics w/ inc CVP to
   15-20 on [**11-29**].  Prior TTE additionally notable for bowing of the
   septum c/w volume overload.  Given these limitation, would recommend
   CVP goal [**10-19**] on CVVH. Ongoing +Tn concerning for mild demand
   ischemia.
   -attempt gentle CVVH diuresis to eliminate intraventricular dependence
   -consider inhaled pulmonary vasodilator, but has continued to make
   progress on vent.
   3. ARF
 On CVVH, will hold on further attempts at negative fluid
   balance while weaning paralytics.
   4. Anemia- Goal 25-30 given ongoing ischemia.
   5. PAF
 HR in nl range currently.  Holding BB.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I was physically present with the housestaff team for discussion of the
   above history, physical, data and assessment and plan with which I
   agree.  I would add the following comments.
   Patient is a 67 yo male admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and
   shock.  This is in the setting of a history of COPD and CHF with
   initial presentation with hypoxemic respiratory compromise and with
   asymmetric ground glass opacities noted with Right>Left.  He has had
   viral source considered most likely.
   Over time his hypotension has been treated with pressors.  He has
   required paralytics with concern for significant hypoxemia and
   hypotension with ongoing respiratory effort.  He did have PE evaluation
   which was negative.  He did have paralytics discontinued and has been
   weaned to neosynephrine alone for pressors.
   EXAM-
   Patient with bilateral crackles actually left>right
   Labs-All microbiology studies negative at this time in regards to
   culture with GPC
s on BAL specimen seen.  Influenza PCR is pending
   CXR-CVL/OGT and ETT in good position.  Patient with persistent
   pulmonary infiltrates in right lung with effusion suggested R>L
   A/P
67 yo male with acute presentation with what is clinically
   consistent with acute pulmonary infection concerning for H1N1 influenza
   despite DFA negative studies.  This is currently well supported by the
   fact that CvO2 remains elevated despite elevated right sided heart
   pressures.  At this time we have been able to keep fluid balance
   negative with CVVH and wean in FIO2 to 0.5 has been effected.
   By problem
   1)Respiratory Failure-Hypoxemic, secondary to infection likely viral or
   atypical bacterial infection.
   Pneumonia-Vanco/Cefepime/Levofloxacin/Tamiflu-all renally dosed for
   CVVH
   Will continue with A/C support and maintain current settings
   Follow culture results
   Move to negative fluid balance as possible
   2)Shock
This would appear to be sepsis given current findings with
   fever, elevated CvO2 and likely pulmonary source of infection.
   -Will continue with Neo/Vasopressin
   -Will continue with [**Year (4 digits) **] spectrum antibiotics
   -Will follow culture results
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Move to CVVH at this time and work to goal fluid balance negative
   4)Myocardial infarction-
   -Patient with persistent troponin and CK-MB elevation (MB=21)
   -Will continue to support for sepsis as defined above
   -Cardiology involved
   -Heparin/ASA in place
   -Will add statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of a recent suspected H1N1 infection. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 115/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 209 K/uL, elevated troponin levels, and evidence of renal failure. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure - likely infectious but differential for multifocal infiltrates in this setting is relatively atypical pneumonia. Most likely viral versus atypical bacterial infection. Expanded antibiotic coverage was given yesterday due to low-grade temperature on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- GPCs on gram stain from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) but no growth (albeit on antibiotics).
Secretions are thick and tan.
- Vancomycin/lev"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. On admission, the patient's vital signs included a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 115/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's FiO2 was weaned, and neosynephrine was weaned minimally. The patient remains sedated and unable to provide history. Allergies include sulfa. 

Infusions include phenylephrine, midazolam, vasopressin, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), heparin sodium (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), and propofol. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of right lower extremity pain and swelling. 

Physical examination findings include right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right DP pulse not assessed, left DP pulse not assessed, and skin not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

   .
   # Hypotension: Cardiogenic shock with severe right heart failure and
   high pulm vasc resistants, also with some septic component.  He was
   transitioned from dopamine and levophed to vasopressin in an attempt to
   wean pressors.
   - pressors as needed for MAPs>60; wean vasopressin
   - consider NO for pulm vasodilation and better forward flow if BP
   decompensates again
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 8 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient with multilobar pneumonia,
   bacterial vs. viral (H1N1).  Requiring high MV (13.6).  Some component
   of edema as currently up 15L LOS.  Unlikely MI, TRALI, or PE. Weaned on
   vent from PEEP 8 to 5over course of day yesterday.
   - low TV ventilation goal 6 cc/kg
   - continue diuresis -50 cc/hr keeping CVP >8
   - Vanc, Cefepime, Levofloxacin for pneumonia for 8 days from [**11-28**] to
   [**12-6**]
   - Tamiflu at renally adjusted treatment dose; could consider peramivir;
   virology still waiting for state lab results
   - combivent standing
   - trial of inhailed NO
   .
   # CAD: Likely ongoing ischemia, possibly demand related, but may also
   be occlusive.  Cardiology following along and appreciate recs.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   benefit from cardiac cath if sufficiently stable.
   - on ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN given hypotension
   vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Started on CVVH.
   - continue CVVH with goal of negative 25 cc/hr
   - continue to follow acidosis, is likely all non-compensated metabolic
   as his pCO2 are normal
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 27 on admission to OSH. Received 1u PRBCs.
   - trend, daily sufficient
   - has been stable recently
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib, avg heart rate with wide variation 70s to
   120s.
   -rate: hold metoprolol given current pressor requirement.
   -anticoagulation: coumadin on hold, heparin drip w/ ACS dosing
   - consider cardioversion tomorrow

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Myocardial Infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient likely has ongoing ischemia, possibly demand-related, but may also be occlusive. Cardiology is following along and appreciates recommendations for cardiac catheterization if sufficiently stable.

2. Respiratory Failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia, bacterial versus viral (H1N1). He requires high mechanical ventilation (MV) and some component of edema. He was weaned on the ventilator from PEEP 8 to 5 over the course of the day yesterday.

3. Renal Failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient has baseline creatinine of 1.1 and is likely experiencing either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or contrast-induced nephropathy. He has been started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

4. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient's hypotension is due to cardi"

   # Hypotension: Cardiogenic shock with severe right heart failure and
   high pulm vasc resistants, also with some septic component.  He was
   transitioned from dopamine and levophed to vasopressin in an attempt to
   wean pressors.
   - pressors as needed for MAPs>60
   - consider NO for pulm vasodilation and better forward flow if BP
   decompensates again
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 10 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient with multilobar pneumonia,
   bacterial vs. viral (H1N1).  Requiring high MV (13.6).  Some component
   of edema as currently up 15L LOS.  Unlikely MI, TRALI, or PE. Weaned on
   vent from PEEP 8 to 5over course of day yesterday.
   - low TV ventilation
   - continue diuresis -25 cc/hr keeping CVP > 10
   - Vanc, Levofloxacin for pneumonia for 8 days from [**11-28**] to [**12-6**]
   - Tamiflu at renally adjusted treatment dose; could consider peramivir;
   virology still waiting for state lab results
   - combivent standing

   # CAD: Likely ongoing ischemia, possibly demand related, but may also
   be occlusive.  Cardiology following along and appreciate recs.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   benefit from cardiac cath if sufficiently stable.
   - cont heparin at ACS PTT goals
   - consider plavix load and cath

   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN given hypotension
   vs. contrast induced nephropathy.  Started on CVVH.
   - continue CVVH with goal of negative 25 cc/hr
   - continue to follow acidosis, is likely all non-compensated metabolic

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI), Acute: The patient has ongoing ischemia possibly related to demand or occlusion. Cardiology is following along and recommends a cardiac catheterization if the patient is sufficiently stable.

2. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient requires high mechanical ventilation due to multilobar pneumonia, bacterial versus viral (H1N1). The patient has been weaned from PEEP 8 to 5 over the course of the day yesterday.

3. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient has baseline creatinine (Cr) of 1.1. The cause of acute renal failure is uncertain between hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient has been started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

4. Sepsis, Severe: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The source of infection is suspected to be respiratory due to multilobar pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
    1. Respiratory failure:  Likely viral PNA and ARDS
   - Vt 430ml at low-tidal volume.  Ventilation adequate.
   - Aim TBB negative today and monitor for increasing pressor requirement
   - PEEP titration today
   - Wheezing today, possible airways resistance with viral infection.
   Standing bronchodilators.
    2. Shock: Septic +/- cardiogenic
   - Suspect persistent vasodilation with infection
   - Change to levophed in favor of vasopressin given reduced CvO2
   - NO trial and follow CvO2 and PaO2 improvement as markers for
   response.  Could consider sildenafil if responds.
    3. ID:  ? H1N1, remains broadly covered
   - H1N1 PCR pending from state lab
   - Check lower-respiratory sample for viral panel DFA
   - Given question of poor GI absorption, will consider peramivir.
    4. Renal:  Renal failure, possible ATN
   - Goal CVP 8-10, monitor hemodynamics given pressor requirement as he
   is diuresed.
    5. CHF/Afib:  TTE with RV dysfunction.  PE-CT at OSH without PE.
       Likely in setting of ARDS and high PVR.
   - NO trial today as above
   - Appreciate cardiology input but would not favor aggressive ischemic
   evaluation at this time given clinical picture predominately sepsis and
   ARDS, suspect + biomarkers in setting of sepsis.
   - Digoxin qod; digoxin level tomorrow

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation (Afib). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxemia and shock, with the etiology being uncertain between cardiogenic and septic origins. 

The patient's presentation included fevers, myalgias, rigors, and contact with a sick individual suspicious for influenza. He experienced ventricular dyssynchrony while off propofol and during turning to the right side, indicating potential cardiac instability. His FiO2 and PEEP were increased, and vasopressin was restarted.

The patient has several allergies, including sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), with unknown allergens. His last doses of antibiotics were cefipime and vancomycin. Other medications include oseltamivir, levofloxacin, heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam (versed), potassium chloride (KCl) for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), calcium gluconate for CRRT, propofol, vasopressin, protonix, digoxin every other day (qod), colace, and Lipitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, pneumonia, acute renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and is also experiencing fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved but may still require pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. There is a risk of recurrent hypotension if the septic shock does not fully resolve.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 50%. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation if the underlying cause of respiratory failure is not adequately treated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.1. There is a risk of worsening renal function if the underlying cause (septic shock, contrast-induced nephropathy, or ATN) is not addressed.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload with positive fluid balance and pitting edema in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dCHF, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and CAD who presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock with severe right heart failure and high pulmonary vascular resistances, along with a septic component. The patient has been transitioned from dopamine and levophed to vasopressin in an attempt to wean off pressors.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, bacterial vs. viral (H1N1), and is requiring high mechanical ventilation. Some component of edema is present as the patient is up 15 liters of fluid output so far. Unlikely causes of hypoxemia include myocardial infarction, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), or pulmonary embolism. The patient has been weaned off from PEEP 8 to 5 over the course of the day yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Right Heart Failure (RHF), and sepsis, possibly due to a viral infection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume ventilation. The patient has been receiving various medications including vasopressor support with levophed, antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin), and antiviral medication (oseltamivir). The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with regular updates on vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to worsening hypoxemia and further respiratory compromise.
2. Shock: The patient's RHF and vasoplegia related to resolving infection can contribute to ongoing hemodynamic instability and shock.
3. Infectious disease: There is a suspicion of a viral infection, and the patient is at risk for developing secondary infections while in the ICU.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to renal impairment. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is necessary.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (pAF) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with right ventricular dysfunction. Monitoring for arrhythmias and cardiac ischemia is important"

The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, right heart failure (RHF), and sepsis, possibly secondary to a viral infection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is being treated with vasopressin, low-dose levophed, and antibiotics (cefipime and vancomycin). The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, and his last dose of antibiotics was given on 02/05/2102 at 08:02 AM. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/41 mmHg to 163/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a CVP of 14 mmHg. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 4,020 mL and output of 4,814 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 794 mL. The patient's urine output is 657 mL, and his NG output is 150 mL. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, platelet count of 157 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 1.82. Other lab results are within normal limits. 

Assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Continue low tidal volume ventilation and supportive care. Decrease PEEP to 8 and drop FiO2 to 0.4 later if tolerated.
2. Shock: Continue levophed and consider using it for volume removal if needed.
3. ID: Continue oseltamivir and vancomycin/levofloxacin for 10 days.
4. Renal: Aim for TBB negative on CVVH.
5. CV: Monitor digoxin level and consider PO amiodarone per cardiology. Discontinue heparin for ACS and afib (in SR).
6. Neuro: Perform daily awakening trials and follow triglycerides tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation, using oral hygiene, and avoiding unnecessary aspiration should be implemented.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as heparin subcutaneously and TEDS/boots should be initiated.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk for stress ulcers. Pro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dCHF, COPD, and Afib, presenting with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU, where he has been receiving various treatments and interventions for his multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may be due to prolonged immobility, pressure sores, or decreased nutrition. Proper skin assessment and prevention strategies should be implemented to prevent further complications.
2. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to reduced oral intake, malabsorption, or inadequate caloric intake. Nutritional support should be provided to meet the patient's requirements and promote healing.
3. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient's history of CAD and current presentation suggest the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. Continuous monitoring and appropriate cardiac interventions are necessary to manage this condition.
4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to his underlying COPD and hypoxemic respiratory distress. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation should be maintained through appropriate respiratory support measures.
5. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of fluid balance"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on Coumadin, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive and did not respond to inhaled nitrate. However, it is improving and likely resolving septic shock. The patient is on a low dose of levophed and will be weaned as tolerated.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is still on PEEP of 10 but down to 50% FiO2. A trial of inhaled NO did not augment cardiac output. The goal is to maintain low TV ventilation with a target of 6 cc/kg, continue diuresis, and keep CVP >8.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been on Vanc and Cefepime for pneumonia for 8 days from [11-28] to [12-6] and will be discontinued today.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient likely has demand ischemia, and card"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about volume overload and bronchospasm. The patient's shock is improving, and renal function is being managed with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). There are no positive cultures, so the course of antibiotics can be discontinued. The patient's cardiovascular status should be evaluated for ischemia once there is improvement. The patient is critically ill and remains in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and flow limitation on exam indicate ongoing respiratory failure. Complications such as worsening hypoxemia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or barotrauma may occur.
2. Shock: Although the patient's shock is improving, there is still a risk of deterioration. Complications such as organ hypoperfusion or cardiac arrhythmias may occur.
3. Renal dysfunction: CVVH is being used to manage the patient's renal function, but there is still a risk of renal failure or fluid overload.
4. Infectious complications: Despite no positive cultures, the patient is still at risk for infections due to immunosuppression. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, bloodstream infection, or catheter-related urinary tract infection may occur.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient tolerated continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) at a rate of 100 ml/hr without significant change in blood pressure. The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and has received vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics. The patient is currently on multiple infusions including norepinephrine, fentanyl, propofol, potassium chloride (CRRT), and calcium gluconate (CRRT). Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/57 mmHg to 163/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 at 50%, and mixed venous oxygen saturation between 80-80%. The patient's weight is currently 94.2 kg, with a height of 67 inches. Central venous pressure is 13 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 6,201 mL and output of 7,588 mL since midnight.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which is slowly improving with the use of Levophed. It is important to monitor and adjust the dose of Levophed as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) should be kept greater than 8 to ensure preload for right ventricular (RV) failure.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient failed a trial of pressure support ventilation (PS) due to persistent hypoxia. However, his pulmonary mechanics are slowly improving, and he can tolerate lower partial oxygen pressures (PaO2) while maintaining oxygen saturation above 100%. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is now on Combivent for respiratory support.

3. Bradycardia/sinus block: The patient intermittently drops P waves, indicating bradycardia and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS thought to be secondary to H1N1 infection. He is currently in the ICU and requires increased sedation and volume control due to increased work of breathing and vent dysynchrony. The patient's allergies include sulfa, and he has been on various medications such as oseltamivir, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), propofol, fentanyl, and others. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/48 mmHg to 90/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a CVP of 15 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 7,840 mL and output of 10,674 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,834 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 174 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 11.2 L/min. The patient's physical examination reveals somnolence, clear anterior lung sounds, regular rapid respirations (RRR), and minimal edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 22.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 120 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 0.9 to 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 116 to 132 mg/dL, and various other lab results. The patient's chest X-ray shows lower lung volumes with worsening bilateral interstitial opacities. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure secondary to ARDS, shock with suspected cardiogenic component, cardiac issues such as first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) and possible sinus block, renal failure with plans for continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH), and hematological issues including thrombocytopenia and anemia. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS thought to be secondary to H1N1 infection. The patient required increased sedation and a change to volume control yesterday due to increased work of breathing and ventilator dyssynchrony. The patient's PaO2 has improved today. The patient has allergies to sulfa medications, and the last dose of antibiotics given was Oseltamivir.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure secondary to ARDS: The patient is on volume control ventilation with a tidal volume of 420 mL, PEEP of 10, and FiO2 of 0.5. The goal is to attempt to decrease PEEP and FiO2 while continuing the current tidal volume settings.
2. Shock: There is a suspected cardiogenic component with right ventricular overload. The patient is stable on low-dose norepinephrine. It is planned to continue norepinephrine and follow systemic vascular resistance if reducing or discontinuing it.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has first-degree atrioventricular block, possibly sinus block, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Digoxin has been discontinued, and amiodarone will be continued. Heparin therapy will be therapeutic rather than prophylactic. A cardiac ischemic evaluation will be conducted following improvement of ARDS.
4. Renal failure: Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch, 94.2 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 122/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with ventilator support. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased work of breathing and vent dysynchrony, for which increased sedation and change to volume control were required. 

The patient is receiving several medications and infusions, including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), propofol, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's lab results show abnormal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and others. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 174, and base excess of -1 mEq/L. 

The patient's physical examination reveals absent peripheral pulses"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dCHF, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and CAD who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications that require careful management.

1. Hypotension: The patient requires lower doses of levophed and has been started on dopamine due to bradycardic episodes. Levophed will be weaned as tolerated, and efforts will be made to keep the central venous pressure (CVP) above 8 to ensure preload for right ventricular (RV) failure. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) may be considered.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient failed a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday due to hypoxia, but pulmonary mechanics are slowly improving. The patient can tolerate lower oxygen saturations if still maintaining 100% saturation. The respiratory viral culture is negative. Diuresis will be continued to keep CVP >8, and the patient has completed a course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Tamiflu has been given at a renally adjusted treatment dose for 10 days.

3. Bradycardia/sinus block: The patient has intermittent dropping P waves. Digoxin has been stopped, and amiodarone will be continued. No signs of ischemia are seen on"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, and myocardial infarction.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been requiring lower doses of levophed and added dopamine due to bradycardic episodes. Levophed will be weaned as tolerated, and the CVPs will be maintained above 8 to ensure preload for right ventricular (RV) failure. Diuresis will be continued with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), decreasing to 50cc/hr.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient failed a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday due to persistent hypoxia, but pulmonary mechanics are slowly improving. The patient will tolerate lower PO2 levels if still saturating at 100%. Respiratory viral culture is negative, and diuresis will be continued with CVP >8.

3. Bradycardia/sinus block: The patient has intermittent dropping P waves, and digoxin has been stopped due to these episodes. Amiodarone"

   1.       Shock:  persistent levophed; low dose dopamine
   - Goal CVP 8-10; BP slightly lower than yesterday.  Would favor
   euvolemia given evidence of hemodynamic instability
   - MAP > 60
   - d/c dopamine given low-dose might contribute to vasodilation
   2.       Respiratory Failure:
   - Maintain low-tidal volume ventilation
   - decrease FiO2 to 0.4
   - will discuss trach with wife if no improvement over weekend
   3.       PNA:
   - Send cultures: UA/Ucx/sputum/blood
   - Completed courses of oseltamivir/vancomycin/cefipime

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS likely secondary to H1N1. He has been experiencing bradycardia with sinus pauses, for which digoxin and amiodarone have been withheld. Dobutamine was started but led to bursts of ventricular arrhythmia, so dopamine was changed with adequate blood pressure and improvement in arrhythmia. The patient's PaO2 decreased with a drop in PEEP, so PEEP was increased. The patient has a history of CAD and is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, dopamine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), fentanyl, and others. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 54-171 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block. His weight is currently 94.2 kg, and height is 67 inches. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and other settings. The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.7 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 7.7 g"

   67yoM with h/o CAD, here with ARDS thought secondary to possible
   influenza.
   1.       Shock:  persistent levophed; low dose dopamine
   - Goal CVP 8-10; BP slightly lower than yesterday.  Would favor
   euvolemia given evidence of hemodynamic instability
   - MAP > 60
   - d/c dopamine given low-dose might contribute to vasodilation
   2.       Respiratory Failure:
   - Maintain low-tidal volume ventilation
   - decrease FiO2 to 0.4
   - will discuss trach with wife if no improvement over weekend
   3.       PNA:
   - Send cultures: UA/Ucx/sputum/blood
   - Completed courses of oseltamivir/vancomycin/cefipime
   4.       CV: sinus pause?
   - holding digoxin and amiodarone for now
   - Eventual cath if improves
   5.       Renal:
           - CVVH even today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS thought to be secondary to H1N1. The patient has experienced several medical complications, including bradycardia with sinus pauses, ventricular arrhythmia, and respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Shock: The patient is still on vasopressor support (levoephed) indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. There is a concern for persistent shock.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low-tidal volume strategy. However, there is a need to discuss the possibility of tracheostomy with the wife if there is no improvement over the weekend.

3. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has completed courses of oseltamivir, vancomycin, and cefipime. Cultures have been sent for urinary antigen, urine culture, sputum culture, and blood culture to rule out any ongoing infection.

4. Cardiac Conduction Abnormality: The patient has experienced sinus pauses, and digoxin and amiodarone have been held. An eventual pacemaker may be necessary if the condition improves.

5. Renal Failure: The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to renal dysfunction.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, hemodynamic stability, and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Atrial Flutter (AFLUTTER): The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, a type of abnormal heart rhythm.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to prolonged bed rest or poor circulation.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has an alteration in nutrition, likely due to inadequate intake or malabsorption.

   # Hypotension: Had been requiring lower doses of levophed.  Added
   dopamine because of bradycardic episodes but now off and no further
   bradycardic episodes
   - Levophed as needed for MAPs>60; wean as tolerated.
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 8 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Failed trial of PS yesterday [**2-6**]
   hypoxia, pulmonary mechanics slowly improving, will tolerate lower PO2s
   if still satting 100%. Respiratory viral culture negative.
   - Finished course of [**Month/Day (2) 40**] for VAP, however low grade fevers and +GNRs on
   sputum GS, consider restarting [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] check CXR and if worse or if

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suspected to be secondary to H1N1 influenza. He is currently in the ICU and has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, requiring neoreminephrine for blood pressure support. The patient's respiratory failure persists despite mechanical ventilation, and there are concerns about hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to the presence of GNR and yeast in the sputum culture. The patient's renal function is being monitored, and he has been on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) but has been taken off due to concerns about the hemodialysis line. The patient's cardiovascular status is also being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure has not improved despite mechanical ventilation, indicating a potential complication related to ARDS.
2. Shock: The patient remains on low-dose levophed, suggesting ongoing hypotension and possible shock.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which requires close monitoring and management.
4. Renal function: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, especially since he has been taken off CVVH.
5. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The presence of GNR and yeast in the sputum culture raises concerns for HAP,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, possibly secondary to H1N1 influenza, who is critically ill and currently in the ICU. He has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and requires norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. The patient has been weaned off CVVH due to concerns about hemodynamic instability. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. His oxygenation has improved, but he still has hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's heart rhythm is now improved, and he is being restarted on amiodarone. There are concerns about worsening lung infiltrates, which may indicate ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's renal status is stable, and he has been on a holiday from CVVH. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, and he is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Shock: The patient is still dependent on norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability and the potential for shock.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently stable, but"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for several medical conditions.

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient tolerated a trial of pressure support (PS) ventilation and has improving pulmonary mechanics. The respiratory viral culture is negative. The plan is to continue with combined therapy and attempt to wean off the ventilator when appropriate.

2. Hypotension: The patient is now off levophed and dopamine. The goal is to maintain central venous pressures (CVPs) above 8 to ensure preload for right ventricular (RV) failure. 

3. Bradycardia/sinus block: The patient's P waves are intermittently dropping, but have improved with discontinuation of digoxin and amiodarone. Continuous monitoring is recommended.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient likely has demand ischemia, and cardiology would like to perform a cardiac catheterization (cath) in the future to assess his anatomy for possible CABG. The patient is currently on aspirin (ASA) and a statin, with plans for catheterization once stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS thought to be secondary to H1N1. The patient has shown increased PaCO2 on a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday, with a respiratory rate increase breath (RISB) of 70. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 67-118 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 72/44 to 119/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on several medications including fentanyl, heparin sodium, Wellbutrin, Prozac, ASA, Simvastatin, Albuterol/atrovent q4h, and amiodarone.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and unknown allergies. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin, cefepime, and cipro.

The patient's current medical and family history remains unchanged. The patient's physical examination reveals clear anterior chest sounds with reduced and bronchial breath sounds at the left base. The patient has irregular heart rhythm with atrial flutter and minimal edema.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.3 g/dL, plate"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, possibly secondary to H1N1. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's recent events include a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) with increased PaCO2, reintubation, and the restart of antibiotics due to concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is off pressors and his vital signs are relatively stable, although he has a fever. The patient's weight has increased from 80 kg at admission to 94.2 kg currently.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on an endotracheal tube with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode, assisted/synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), and automatic flow (AutoFlow). The set tidal volume (Vt) is 430 mL, the respiratory rate (RR) is set at 30 breaths per minute, the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, and the respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 55. The plateau pressure is 23 cmH2O and the negative inspiratory force (NIF) is -34 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he opens his eyes to voice, does not track, and does not follow commands. There is no scleral edema and his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG surgery puts him at risk for myocardial infarction. The EKG changes and cardiac enzymes mentioned in the note indicate possible ischemia.

2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress to severe respiratory failure if not adequately managed. Prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation may be necessary due to pneumonia.

3. Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient's presentation with fevers and positive sputum culture suggests a severe infection leading to sepsis. This condition requires prompt management to prevent further organ dysfunction.

4. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria indicate acute renal failure. CVVH was initiated but had to be stopped due to an infected line. Restarting CVVH and"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.
- EKG changes were observed, but it is unclear if they were due to interference with leads. The cardiac enzymes were flat, suggesting some demand ischemia.
- The patient is on esmolol for rate control, heparin gtt, aspirin, and a statin. Cardiology input is appreciated, and a cardiac catheterization is planned once the patient is out of the ICU.
- The patient is slowly weaning off mechanical ventilation but may need a prolonged wean. A positive sputum culture and fevers suggest pneumonia. Antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.
- Anemia continues to trend down, and the patient has been transfused twice. Phlebotomy is being considered due to heparin gtt.
- Hypotension has resolved, and the patient is now off levophed. CVPs greater than 8 will be maintained to ensure preload for right ventricular failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, thought to be secondary to H1N1 infection. He has experienced several significant events overnight, including tachycardia with ST changes, for which an esmolol drip was started and subsequently resolved. The patient also received a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells due to a decreasing hematocrit level.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) and periodic atrial fibrillation. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes. His oxygen saturation remains at 95% on 50% FiO2.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated troponin levels. The patient's blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods, identified as Pseudomonas, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin. He is currently receiving cefepime and ciprofloxacin, but vancomycin has been discontinued based on current culture data.

The patient's respiratory status has worsened since yesterday, with increased hypoxemia. There is evidence of volume overload, and the team plans to consult interventional pulmonology for the possibility of tracheostomy. The patient's cardiac status needs further evaluation for ischemia, and he may require an ischemic work-up after recovery from his acute episode.

The patient also has constipation/poor gastrointestinal motility"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, believed to be secondary to H1N1. The patient has been experiencing several complications during his stay in the ICU. Overnight, the patient had tachycardia and ST changes on EKG, prompting the initiation of an esmolol drip. The EKG changes subsequently resolved.

The patient required a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells due to a declining hemoglobin concentration. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and is currently on multiple infusions, including heparin sodium, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and an esmolol drip. The esmolol drip was held at some point.

The patient's medical history includes underlying coronary artery disease and periodic atrial fibrillation. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/51 to 150/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,017 mL and output of 423 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,594 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 2 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs with diminished right base, irregular S1S2 heart sounds without murmurs, soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and minimal edema. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin concentration of 6.6 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 113 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T level of 1.74. The patient's sputum culture is positive for gram-negative rods, specifically pseudomonas.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure with worsening hypoxemia, cardiovascular issues related to underlying coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal constipation/poor motility, anemia, renal dysfunction, and infection with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has worsened, leading to increased hypoxemia. This could be due to volume overload, and the team is continuing low tidal volume ventilation. The patient may require a tracheostomy, which the family is agreeable to.

2. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has underlying coronary artery disease and periodic atrial fibrillation. The recent tachycardia and ST changes on EKG indicate potential ischemic concerns. An ischemic work-up should be done after the patient recovers from his acute episode.

3. Gastrointestinal Constipation/Poor Motility: The patient is experiencing constipation/poor gastrointestinal mot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, thought to be secondary to H1N1. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. Overnight, the patient experienced tachycardia with ST changes, and an esmolol drip was started. The EKG changes subsequently resolved. The patient also required a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a decreasing hemoglobin concentration (HCT trending downwards). The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and is currently receiving multiple medications, including cefipime, vancomycin, cipro, heparin sodium, midazolam (versed), fentanyl, and esmolol.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened since yesterday, with increased hypoxemia. This may be due to volume overload. Low tidal volume ventilation will continue, and tracheostomy placement is being considered.
2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) and experiences periodic atrial fibrillation (afib). An ischemic work-up should be conducted after the patient recovers from the acute episode. Esmolol drip may be used as needed for cardiac rhythm control.
3. Gastrointestinal (GI) Issues: The patient is experiencing constipation/poor GI motility. Methylnaltrexone, weaning of fentanyl, bowel regimen, and a KUB"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, thought to be secondary to H1N1 infection. The patient experienced tachycardia overnight with ST changes and was discussed with cardiology. An esmolol drip was started, and EKG changes subsequently resolved. The patient received a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a decreasing hematocrit (HCT) trend. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) and periodic atrial fibrillation. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with increased hypoxemia since yesterday, likely due to volume overload. Low tidal volume ventilation will continue, and the possibility of tracheostomy was discussed with the family and they are agreeable.

The patient also has gastrointestinal (GI) issues such as constipation and poor GI motility. A bowel regimen has been initiated, along with methylnaltrexone to address these concerns. The patient's anemia is suspected to be due to critical illness/renal disease, blood loss during phlebotomy, or possible retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed). Close monitoring of HCT is recommended, and if it continues to decrease, a non-contrast abdominal CT will be done to evaluate for RP hematoma.

Renal replacement therapy has been initiated due to the patient's renal issues. The patient has developed a new ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, suspected to be secondary to H1N1 infection. He also has VAP and a possible line infection with GPC bacteremia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 108/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 430 mL, RR set at 30 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and PIP at 27 cmH2O.

Physical examination findings include clear anterior chest with rhonchi at the bases, irregular heart rhythm, minimal edema, and no abdominal or extremity abnormalities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, increased creatinine level, and low potassium levels. The patient's blood cultures revealed GPC bacteremia, and sputum cultures showed PsA sensitivity to cefipime. Imaging studies show bilateral interstitial opacities with basilar infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Treatment of VAP and addressing gram-positive bacteremia (now speciated as VRE).
   - Decrease FiO2 to 0.4
   - Tracheostomy +/- per"

   67yoM with CAD/CABG; admitted with ARDS and hypoxemic respiratory.
   1.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Now with PsA PNA, as well as
   gram-positive bacteremia
   - Treatment of VAP
   - Likely a component of volume overload as he was off renal replacement
   over past 2 days; will run TBB negative with goal CVP 8-10.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 0.4
   2.  GPC bacteremia:
   - line change
   - change to linezolid from vancomycin until sensitivities return
   3.  PsA PNA:
   - cefepime x 14 days
   4.  Renal
   - Goal TBB negative .5 to 1L on CVVH; or goal CVP 8-10
   5.  GI  constipation
   - methylnatlrexone

   - Tamiflu 10 day course completed
   - combivent standing
   # GPC bacteremia; developed on Vanc.  Contaminant vs. VRE bacteremia.
   - change lines
   - Linazolid in place of vanc
   - follow speciation, may need TEE
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control
   - on heparin gtt.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.
- The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely superimposed on flu-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPC), which developed while on vancomycin. The causative organism is still being determined.
- The patient has coronary artery disease and is experiencing some demand ischemia. Rate control is necessary.
- The patient has anemia, which is stable today. Blood transfusions were given on [**12-10**] and [**12-11**]. Phlebotomy will be performed as needed.
- The patient has hypotension, now off levophed. Preload for right ventricular (RV) failure will be ensured by keeping central venous pressures (CVPs) greater than 8.
- The patient has constipation, likely due to opioid use. It has resolved with methylnaltrexone. Colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl will be continued,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy planned. The patient has been diagnosed with VRE bacteremia, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient's current medications include cefepime, linezolid, heparin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension likely due to septic shock from pseudomonas pneumonia and VRE bacteremia. Measures such as keeping CVPs greater than 8 to ensure preload for right ventricular failure and using levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 60 are being implemented.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has positive sputum culture and fevers suggesting pneumonia, superimposed on likely flu-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A tracheostomy has been planned, and the patient will be given a 10-day course of Tamiflu.

3. VRE bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with VRE bacteremia, likely due to a central venous catheter infection. The right internal jugular vein catheter has already been changed, and the"

   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 8 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   - levophed to MAP > 60
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Positive sputum culture and fevers
   suggest pneumonia, superimposed on likely flu related ARDS. Tamiflu 10
   day course completed
   - Cefepime for 14 day course from [**12-8**]
   - attempt to diurese 1-2L/day
   - Trachostomy to be done today.  Hold Heparin at 4AM, needs DDAVP
   - combivent standing
   # VRE bacteremia: Likely [**2-6**] line infection.  Right IJ changed  on [**12-8**] need to change CVVH line as was in for 24 hours prior to
   linazolid if persistent culture positive.
   - daily cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock caused by pseudomonas pneumonia and VRE bacteremia. There is a risk of further hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has positive sputum culture and fevers suggesting pneumonia, superimposed on likely flu-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The risk of worsening respiratory failure and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) exists.

3. VRE bacteremia: The patient has likely developed VRE bacteremia, which could be due to a central venous catheter infection. There is a risk of spreading the infection or developing sepsis again.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient likely has demand ischemia, and there is a risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina. Rate control and antiplatelet therapy should be considered.

5. Anemia: The patient is anemic but stable for now. However, there is a risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, likely secondary to H1N1 (unconfirmed). The patient has been experiencing hypotension and required restarting on levophed after not responding to fluid bolus. The patient also has confirmed VRE bacteremia and a central line was changed. The patient's HD catheter clotted off twice yesterday. The patient is allergic to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and the last dose of antibiotics was Linezolid on 12/13/2102 at 12:36 AM and Cefipime on 12/13/2102 at 08:23 AM. The patient is currently on several infusions including midazolam (versed) at 3 mg/hour, norepinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, fentanyl at 300 mcg/hour, and heparin held. Other medications include Wellbutrin, ASA, Colace, Simvastatin, Albuterol/atrovent, Epo, and Amiodarone PO. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/53 to 144/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and a C"

   67yoM with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1 (unconfirmed); course now
   complicated by VRE bacteremia and PsA PNA.
   1.       Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  ARDS, volume overload, PsA PNA
   -   Keep TBB even to slightly negative today given possible active
   sepsis
   - Treatment of infectious process
   -   Trial of PSV, can wean FiO2 after trach and wean sedation
   2.       Shock:  Back on levophed, CVP > 15 and was not fluid
   responsive.  Pressors weaning down.  Suspect sepsis in setting of line
   infection.
   - continue to wean levophed as tolerates
   - Continue antibiotics
   - repeat CvO2
   3.       PsA PNA
   - continue cefipime x 14 days
   4.       VRE Bacteremia:  Likely line source
   - Linezolid
   - s/p line change
   5.       CV: afib, h/o CAD
   - continue amiodarone
   - restart heparin
   6.       GI:
   - methylnaltrexone
   7.       Neuro:
   - wean narcotics after trach

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, likely secondary to H1N1 influenza (unconfirmed). The patient has experienced several complications during their stay in the ICU.

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, volume overload, and PsA PNA. Treatment includes keeping the tidal volume below the recommended limit, treating the infectious process, and weaning FiO2 and sedation.

2. Shock: The patient was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s overnight and was not responsive to fluid resuscitation. The patient is on levophed and the pressors are being weaned down. Sepsis is suspected due to a line infection.

3. PsA PNA: The patient has been diagnosed with PsA PNA and is receiving cefipime for treatment.

4. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed VRE bacteremia, which is likely due to a line source. Linezolid has been started, and the central line has been changed.

5. CV: The patient has atrial fibrillation and a history of CAD. Amiodarone is being continued, and heparin has been restarted.

6. GI: Methylnaltrexone may be considered for gastrointestinal symptoms.

7. Neuro: Narcotics should be weaned after tracheostomy.

8. Renal: CVVH is currently down"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF
   # Hypotension: Possibly septic, but hypotension resolved and afebrile
   o/n w/o leukocytosis, surveillance cultures negative, off pressors
   currently. If develops hypotension again will start running CVVH even
   and give some fluid back.
   - fluid bolus if needed to keep MAP>60
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**2-6**] influenza initially, now
   likely VAP possibly some fluid overload. Now s/p trach.
   - d/c midazolam wean sedation
   - Cefepime for 14 day course from [**12-8**]
   - attempt to diurese 1-2L/day
   - combivent standing
   # VRE bacteremia: Likely [**2-6**] line infection.  Right IJ changed  on
   [**12-12**], catheter tip culture pending.
   - Send cultures from CVVH line.
   - may need to change CVVH line as was in for 24 hours prior to
   linazolid if persistent culture positive.
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Linazolid 2 week course from [**12-12**]
   - Consider TEE once stable
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control
   - on heparin gtt.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   # Anemia: Very low retic count, transfusing today likely BM suppression
   from influenza and critical illness
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: likely [**2-6**] opiod.  Resolved with Methylnaltrexone
   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - repear Methylnaltrexone if worsening
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off CVVH as Cr rises after d/c
   - continue CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improving.  Likely [**2-6**] CRRT. HIT negative, normal
   fibrinogen
   - restart heparin gtt given recent a.fib/flutt
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt
   - Amiodarone
   # Depression: Will hold Prozac while on linazolid and plan to restart
   once linzolid course complete

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including percutaneous tracheostomy, central venous catheter placement, hemodialysis, and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's current medical complications include hypotension, hypoxemic respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, anemia, constipation, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and depression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypotension leading to septic shock, development of further respiratory failure and VAP, persistent VRE bacteremia, worsening renal function, exacerbation of anemia, worsening constipation, thrombotic events, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, and worsening depression.

These potential complications need to be closely monitored and managed accordingly to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock from pseudomonas pneumonia and VRE
   bacteremia.
   - will try to keep CVPs greater than 8 to ensure preload for the RV
   failure
   - levophed to MAP > 60
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Positive sputum culture and fevers
   suggest pneumonia, superimposed on likely flu related ARDS. Tamiflu 10
   day course completed
   - Cefepime for 14 day course from [**12-8**]
   - attempt to diurese 1-2L/day
   - Trachostomy to be done today.  Hold Heparin at 4AM, needs DDAVP
   - combivent standing
   # VRE bacteremia: Likely [**2-6**] line infection.  Right IJ changed  on [**12-8**] need to change CVVH line as was in for 24 hours prior to
   linazolid if persistent culture positive.
   - daily cultures
   - Linazolid 2 week course from [**12-12**]
   - TEE once stable
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control
   - on heparin gtt.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   # Anemia: Stable today.  Transfused 1U on [**12-10**] and 1 U in [**12-11**].  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   [**2-6**] phlebotomy.  Given heparin gtt, can not r/o RP hematoma
   - CT abdomen if continues to trend down
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: likely [**2-6**] opiod.  Resolved with Methylnaltrexone
   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - repear Methylnaltrexone if worsening
   # Acute renal failure: Volume up and Cr trending up off of CVVH.
   Baseline Cr 1.1. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN given hypotension vs. contrast induced
   nephropathy.  Started on CVVH. UOP has been increasing.
   - continue CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable.  Likely [**2-6**] CRRT. HIT negative, normal
   fibrinogen
   - restart heparin gtt given recent a.fib/flutt
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin and
   amiodarone. Consider restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt
   # Depression: Will hold Prozac while on linazolid and plan to restart
   once linzolid course complete

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock from pseudomonas pneumonia and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. Measures such as maintaining central venous pressure (CVP) greater than 8 to ensure preload for right ventricular (RV) failure and using vasopressors like levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 are being implemented.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has positive sputum culture and fevers suggesting pneumonia, superimposed on likely influenza-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Antibiotic therapy with cefepime for 14 days, diuresis to remove 1-2 liters of fluid per day, tracheostomy, and combination of ipratropium bromide and albuterol (Combivent) are part of the management plan.

3. VRE bacteremia: The patient is likely experiencing a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) with VRE. Daily cultures, changing the"

   67M with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1; course complicated by VAP, VRE
   bacteremia from line infection; now s/p trach.
   1.       Respiratory failure.  s/p trach yesterday.  Remains hypoxemia
   with FiO2 .5; however, suspect component both of his resolving VAP and
   volume overload.
   - continue to run CVVH negative by 100ml/hr; CVP goal [**8-14**]
   - Wean FiO2 today
   - Sedation as below
   2.       PsA PNA
   - cefipime x 16days for PsA VAP
   3.       VRE:
   - continue linezolid x 14 days for bacteremia
   - Once afebrile/assure surveillance cultures
   4.       Neuro:
   - discontinue versed; assess mental status and consider haldol for
   agitation/anxiety/delirium
   - Wean fentanyl today; prefer bolus of IV narcotics prn for pain
   5.       Ileus/partial SBO:  demonstrated by increased NGT output
   - continue NGT to suction and monitor output.
   - methlynaltrexone; decreasing narcotics.
   - Avoid kaxyelate in setting of ileus/partial obstruction as increased
   risk of perforation.
   6.        Renal:
   - CVVH negative today.  If BP remains stable and overall improving,
   will discuss possible switch to HD.
   - suspect increased metabolic acidosis/AG secondary to CVVH change
   yesterday.  Lactate negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS thought to be secondary to H1N1 influenza. The patient underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy yesterday and experienced transient mediastinal free air, which resolved on repeat chest X-ray. The patient was unable to have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to feculent material in the stomach, so a nasogastric tube (NGT) is being used for suction overnight with some output. The patient also has mild obstruction of the kidneys, as shown by the KUB demonstrated mild obstruction.

The patient is currently off pressors and receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a slight decrease in hematocrit (HCT). Oral medications cannot be administered due to NGT output. The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), and the last doses of antibiotics given were linezolid and cefepime on December 14th at 12:27 AM and 7:15 AM, respectively.

The patient is receiving several infusions including fentanyl, midazolam (versed), heparin sodium, and potassium chloride (KCl) for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), which was started on December 14th at 7:15 AM. The patient's medical history includes Wellbutrin, ASA 325 mg daily"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1; course complicated by VAP, VRE
   bacteremia from line infection; now s/p trach.
   1.       Respiratory failure.  s/p trach yesterday.  Remains hypoxemia
   with FiO2 .5; however, suspect component both of his resolving VAP and
   volume overload.
   - continue to run CVVH negative by 100ml/hr; CVP goal [**8-14**]
   - Wean FiO2 today
   - Sedation as below
   2.       PsA PNA
   - cefipime x 16days for PsA VAP
   3.       VRE:
   - continue linezolid x 14 days for bacteremia
   - Once afebrile/assure surveillance cultures
   4.       Neuro:
   - discontinue versed; assess mental status and consider haldol for
   agitation/anxiety/delirium
   - Wean fentanyl today; prefer bolus of IV narcotics prn for pain
   5.       Ileus/partial SBO:  demonstrated by increased NGT output
   - continue NGT to suction and monitor output.
   - methlynaltrexone; decreasing narcotics.
   - Avoid kaxyelate in setting of ileus/partial obstruction as increased
   risk of perforation.
   6.        Renal:
   - CVVH negative today.  If BP remains stable and overall improving,
   will discuss possible switch to HD.
   - suspect increased metabolic acidosis/AG secondary to CVVH change
   yesterday.  Lactate negative.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, suspected to be secondary to H1N1. He underwent a tracheostomy yesterday due to prolonged respiratory failure. The patient also has feculent material in his stomach, making it difficult to place a PEG tube. As a result, an NGT (nasogastric tube) has been placed on suction overnight with some output.

The patient has been unable to tolerate oral medications due to the NGT output. Additionally, the patient has a mild obstruction in the kidneys based on the KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) imaging.

The patient is currently receiving various infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and potassium chloride through CRRT (continuous renal replacement therapy). Other medications being administered include pantoprazole, ASA, colace, simvastatin, albuterol, atrovent, and amiodarone.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 36.5 to 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 65-77 beats per minute, blood pressure between 100/47-151/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's weight is currently 94.2 kg, and his height is 67 inches.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,516 mL since 12 AM, with an output of 1,894 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 622 mL. The patient has received a total of 350 mL of blood products.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 282, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio is 212.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 6.7 g/dL, platelet count of 159 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 41 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, and chloride level of 105 mEq/L. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.30, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 24 mEq/L, base excess of -5, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 99%, and lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L.

Radiology imaging reveals resolved pneumomediastinum and stable bilateral infiltrates with pulmonary edema.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, which is being managed with tracheostomy and weaning of FiO2. The patient also has pneumonia with a suspected Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, for which cefipime is being administered. Additionally, the patient has VRE bacteremia, and linezolid has been prescribed for 14 days. Neurological status is being monitored, and sedation is being weaned off. The patient is also being evaluated for ileus/partial small bowel obstruction and renal function, with plans to switch from CVVH (continuous venovenous hemofiltration) to hemodialysis if appropriate."

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1; course complicated by VAP, VRE
   bacteremia from line infection; now s/p trach.
   1.       Respiratory failure.  s/p trach yesterday.  Remains hypoxemia
   with FiO2 .5; however, suspect component both of his resolving VAP and
   volume overload.
   - continue to run CVVH negative by 100ml/hr; CVP goal [**8-14**]
   - Wean FiO2 today
   - Sedation as below
   2.       PsA PNA
   - cefipime x 16days for PsA VAP
   3.       VRE:
   - continue linezolid x 14 days for bacteremia
   - Once afebrile/assure surveillance cultures
   4.       Neuro:
   - discontinue versed; assess mental status and consider haldol for
   agitation/anxiety/delirium
   - Wean fentanyl today; prefer bolus of IV narcotics prn for pain
   5.       Ileus/partial SBO:  demonstrated by increased NGT output
   - continue NGT to suction and monitor output.
   - methlynaltrexone; decreasing narcotics.
   - Avoid kaxyelate in setting of ileus/partial obstruction as increased
   risk of perforation.
   6.        Renal:
   - CVVH negative today.  If BP remains stable and overall improving,
   will discuss possible switch to HD.
   - suspect increased metabolic acidosis/AG secondary to CVVH change
   yesterday.  Lactate negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS thought to be secondary to H1N1. He has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has VAP and VRE bacteremia from a line infection. His respiratory status remains hypoxemic despite being on FiO2 of 0.5. The plan includes continuing CVVH negative by 100ml/hr, weaning FiO2 today, and sedation as below. The patient has PsA PNA, for which cefipime will be given for 16 days. He also has VRE bacteremia, and linezolid will be continued for 14 days. Neurologically, the patient is sedated and encephalopathic, and versed will be discontinued. Methylation will be used to treat ileus/partial SBO, and narcotics will be weaned today. Renal function is being managed with CVVH negative, and if the patient's blood pressure remains stable and overall improving, a switch to HD may be discussed. The patient is NPO due to partial SBO, and regular insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, thought to be secondary to H1N1. He has undergone tracheostomy for prolonged respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of feculent material in the stomach, preventing the placement of a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). An NGT (nasogastric tube) has been placed to suction overnight with some output. The patient has mild obstruction in the KUB (kidneys, ureters, bladder), and is unable to administer PO (oral) medications due to NGT output. He is receiving multiple IV infusions including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and KCl (CRRT). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 100/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's mental status is somnolent and unresponsive to commands or external stimuli. Physical examination reveals clear anterior chest, irregular heart rhythm (atrial flutter), and minimal edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 188 K/uL, hyponatremia with an Na+ level of 105 mEq/L, elevated creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count of 159 K/u"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which resolved without leukocytosis and negative surveillance cultures. The hypotension was likely due to septic shock.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially had hypoxemic respiratory failure likely caused by influenza. However, it is now suspected to be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with some fluid overload. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is being weaned off sedation.
3. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia: The patient likely had a line infection with VRE. The right internal jugular catheter was changed, and the tip culture was negative. Daily cultures from the hemodynamic (HD) line are pending, and the CVVH line may need to be changed if persistent culture positive.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient likely has demand ischemia and should have rate control due to his CAD.
5. Anemia: The patient has very low retic count, likely due to bone marrow suppression from influenza and critical illness."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, possibly secondary to unconfirmed H1N1. He has increased abdominal distention with decreased stool output, and an abdominal CT showed right upper lobe pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient required propofol overnight due to increased work of breathing and was switched back to controlled ventilation.

The patient has a history of sulfa allergy and received antibiotics (Linezolid and Cefipime) within the last 24 hours. He is currently on multiple infusions including calcium gluconate (CRRT), fentanyl, KCl (CRRT), and heparin sodium. The patient is also on other medications such as Haldol, ASA, Chlorhexadine, Simvastatin, and Amiodarone.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/45 mmHg to 161/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in atrial flutter, weighs 87 kg, and has a central venous pressure of 18 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,232 mL and total output of 7,541 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,309 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, initially thought to be secondary to unconfirmed H1N1. The patient has shown increased abdominal distention and decreased stool output. An abdominal CT was performed without evidence of obstruction but revealed right upper lobe pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient required propofol overnight due to increased work of breathing and was placed on controlled ventilation. In the morning, the patient was switched back to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and taken off propofol. The patient is unable to provide a history as they are sedated.

   # Fevers: Patient with fever on CVVH and Linazolid/Cefepime.  Possible
   causes include persistent line infection, viral, ESBL bacteria, fungal,
   drug fever.  Currently, stable and off pressors.
   - follow blood, urine cultures
   - consider meropenem if decompensating
   - may need CVVH line change.
   # Hypotension: Possibly septic, but hypotension resolved and afebrile
   o/n w/o leukocytosis, surveillance cultures negative, off pressors
   currently. If develops hypotension again will start running CVVH even
   and give some fluid back.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**2-6**] influenza initially, now
   likely VAP possibly some fluid overload. Now s/p trach.  Patient with
   agitation on vent.
   - on standing haldol, Fentanyl patch and IV bolus; weaning off gtt
   - follow EKG with haldol
   - Increased wheezing likely contributing to agitation, increase
   broncodilators and start Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - Cefepime for 16 day course from [**12-8**]
   - continue diuresis to dry weight 80 kg  (-100cc/hr and CVP >7)
   # VRE bacteremia: Likely [**2-6**] line infection.  Right IJ changed on [**12-12**],
   catheter tip culture negative. Cultures from HD line pending
   - f/u cultures from CVVH line.
   - may need to change CVVH line as was in for 24 hours prior to
   linazolid if persistent culture positive.
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Linazolid 2 week course from [**12-12**]
   - Consider TEE once stable
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control
   - on heparin gtt.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   # Anemia: Very low retic count, likely BM suppression from influenza
   and critical illness
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: likely [**2-6**] opiod.  Resolved initially with
   Methylnaltrexone, now slowing down but minimal residuals from NG
   suction
   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - Methylnaltrexone Q48 hr as needed
   - restart trophic tube feeds and PO meds today, advance TF as tolerated
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off CVVH as Cr rises after d/c
   - continue CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improving.  Likely [**2-6**] CRRT. HIT negative, normal
   fibrinogen
   -  heparin gtt given recent a.fib/flutt
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt
   -Restart coumadin today
   - Amiodarone
   # Depression: Will hold Prozac while on linazolid and plan to restart
   once linzolid course complete

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently being treated in the ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note are:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing increased agitation, which can be a sign of delirium or confusion. This may be related to the patient's underlying conditions or due to medications.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): There is a mention of constipation and the use of medications like opioids, which can contribute to intestinal motility issues and potentially lead to small bowel obstruction.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to immobility or poor circulation. This increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.

4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's ability to receive adequate nutrition may be compromised due to his critical condition and the need for mechanical ventilation.

5. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI): The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of developing an acute myocardial infarction while in the ICU.

   causes include persistent line infection, viral, ESBL bacteria, fungal,
   drug fever.  Currently, stable and off pressors.
   - follow blood, urine cultures
   - consider meropenem if decompensating
   - may need CVVH line change.
   # Hypotension: Possibly septic, but hypotension resolved and afebrile
   o/n w/o leukocytosis, surveillance cultures negative, off pressors

   likely VAP possibly some fluid overload. Now s/p trach.  Patient with
   agitation on vent.
   - on standing haldol, Fentanyl patch and IV bolus; weaning off gtt
   - Increased wheezing likely contributing to agitation, increase
   broncodilators and start Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - Cefepime for 14 day course from [**12-8**]
   - continue diuresis to dry weight 80 kg
   # VRE bacteremia: Likely [**2-6**] line infection.  Right IJ changed on [**12-12**],
   catheter tip culture negative. Cultures from HD line pending
   - f/u cultures from CVVH line.
   - may need to change CVVH line as was in for 24 hours prior to

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient's current conditions include delirium, small bowel obstruction, constipation, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, renal failure, severe sepsis, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient has a fever, which could be due to persistent line infection, viral, ESBL bacteria, fungal, or drug fever. Cultures should be followed, and meropenem may be considered if the patient decompensates. The CVVH line may need to be changed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to septic shock. However, it has resolved and the patient is stable without leukocytosis and negative surveillance cultures. If the hypotension recurs, the patient should be given a fluid bolus to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to [**2-6**] influenza initially, now possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with some fluid overload. The patient has been placed on standing haloperidol, fentanyl patch,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with delirium/confusion, small bowel obstruction, constipation, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, and severe organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers despite being on antibiotics. Possible causes include line infection, viral infection, ESBL bacteria, fungal infection, or drug fever. The patient's stability and negative surveillance cultures should be monitored, and consideration should be given to changing the CVVH line if necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension that resolved overnight without leukocytosis and negative surveillance cultures. If the hypotension recurs, fluid bolus administration may be necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially had hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to influenza, but now it is suspected to be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with some fluid overload. The patient has been treated with haloperidol, fentanyl patch, and IV bolus"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1; course complicated by PsA VAP
   and VRE bacteremia; now s/p trach.
   1. Respiratory failure:  barriers to breathing spontaneously include
   VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance and persistent
   encephalopathy with significant sedation.
   - Continue to diurese aggressively with CVVH
   - Bronchodilators
   - fluticasone inhaled
   - Likely increase his PEEP in response to
rounding-up
 on exam, can
   increase support if needed
   2. Fever:
   3. Neuro:  Likely delirium as well as respiratory distress secondary to
   bronchospasm and volume as above
   - haldol 2.5mg q6h standing and prn; titrate upwards as needed
   - start fentanyl patch 100mcg daily; wean fentanyl drip
   - Will avoid propofol and benzos
   1.       PsA PNA:
   - Cefipime x 16days
   2.       VRE bacteremia:
   - Linezolid x 14day
   3.       Renal:
   - Currently on CVVH; will discuss with renal regarding transition to
   intermittent HD.
   4.       CV:
   - evaluate with cath/ischemic evaluation in future when improved from
   pulmonary perspective
   5.       GI:  ileus/partial obstruction
   - need to minimize narcotics; continue methylnaltrexone
   - NGT output has improved remarkable; continue bowel regimen
   - trophic feeds

The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), now presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suspected to be secondary to H1N1 influenza infection. The patient is also suspected to have acute kidney injury (AKI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

24-hour events include the development of fever with a temperature of 101.2°F. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide a history. Allergies include a known allergy to sulfa-containing antibiotics.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including calcium gluconate (CRRT), fentanyl, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. He is also receiving antibiotics, specifically cefepime and linezolid.

Vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 100 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 129/59 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 inspiratory breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient's rhythm is atrial flutter.

","The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He is now presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suspected to be secondary to H1N1 influenza infection, complicated by pneumonia (PsA), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and requires aggressive diuresis with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance, and persistent encephalopathy with significant sedation.
2. Fever, which may indicate an ongoing infection.
3. Neurological complications such as delirium, likely secondary to respiratory distress, bronchospasm, and volume overload.
4. Renal complications due to the ongoing use of CVVH and potential transition to intermittent hemodialysis (HD).
5. Cardiac complications related to the patient's history of diastolic heart failure and ongoing evaluation for ischemic evaluation in the future.
6. Gastrointestinal complications such as ileus/partial obstruction, which needs to be managed with minimal narcotics, continuation of methylnaltrexone, and bowel regimen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He is now diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) suspected to be caused by H1N1 influenza, along with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), and bacteremia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129/59 to 174/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 857 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH level of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 176 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet (Plt) count within normal range. Renal function tests reveal increased serum creatinine (Cr) levels. Liver function tests show mildly elevated liver enzymes, while electrolyte levels are within normal range. Other lab results indicate elevated troponin-T and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, with no significant findings in the chest, cardiovascular, abdominal, or neurologic examinations.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has multiple barriers to spontaneous breathing, including VAP, volume overload, increased airway resistance, and persistent encephalopathy with significant sedation.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
   - Administer bronchodilators and inhaled fluticasone.
   - Increase PEEP if necessary based on examination findings.

2. Fever: The patient has an ongoing fever.
   - Continue to monitor and treat the underlying cause.

3. Neurological status: The patient likely has delirium secondary to respiratory distress caused by bronchospasm and fluid overload.
   - Administer haloperidol 2"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1; course complicated by PsA VAP
   and VRE bacteremia; now s/p trach.
   1. Fever: has been low-grade until midnight, now with fever to 101.2.
   Blood cultures negative since [**12-11**], when he grew enterococcus.  Also
   with PSA in sputum.  CXR without a clear new infiltrate.
   Hemodynamically stable off pressors.
   - continue same abx for now: linezolid, cefepime
   - repeat UA, urine culture, sputum culture
   - check c. diff
   - monitor hemodynamics; if hypotensive, will likely need to d/c CVVH
   line since it was placed on [**12-11**]
   2. Respiratory failure:  barriers to breathing spontaneously include
   VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance and persistent
   encephalopathy with significant sedation.  Net negative over 3 L since
   yesterday, pressures tolerating volume removal. CVP 7 this morning
   (range 7-23)
   - Decrease goal CVVH rate: neg 100/ hour
   - Continue bronchodilators, fluticasone inhaled
   - Likely increase his PEEP in response to
rounding-up
 on exam, can
   increase support if needed
   3. Neuro:  Likely delirium as well as respiratory distress secondary to
   bronchospasm and volume as above
   - haldol 2.5mg q6h standing and prn; titrate upwards as needed
   - started fentanyl patch 100mcg daily yesterday
   - wean fentanyl gtt by half today: to 50 mcg/hour
   - avoid propofol and benzos
   4. PsA PNA:
   - Cefipime x 16days, starting on [**12-8**]
   5. VRE bacteremia:
   - Linezolid x 14day
   6. Renal:
   - Currently on CVVH; will discuss with renal regarding transition to
   intermittent HD.
   - CVVH line may need to come out given new fever (as above)
   7. CV:
   - evaluate with cath/ischemic evaluation in future when improved from
   pulmonary perspective
   8. GI:  ileus/partial obstruction, responds to methylnaltrexone
   - need to minimize narcotics; continue methylnaltrexone
   - trophic feeds

   and VRE bacteremia; now s/p trach.
   1. Fever: has been low-grade until midnight, now with fever to 101.2.
   Blood cultures negative since [**12-11**], when he grew enterococcus.  Also
   with PSA in sputum.  CXR without a clear new infiltrate.
   Hemodynamically stable off pressors.
   - continue same abx for now: linezolid, cefepime
   - repeat UA, urine culture, sputum culture
   - check c. diff
   - monitor hemodynamics; if hypotensive, will likely need to d/c CVVH
   line since it was placed on [**12-11**]
   2. Respiratory failure:  barriers to breathing spontaneously include
   VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance and persistent
   encephalopathy with significant sedation.  Net negative over 3 L since
   yesterday, pressures tolerating volume removal. CVP 7 this morning
   (range 7-23)
   - Decrease goal CVVH rate: neg 100/ hour
   - Continue bronchodilators, fluticasone inhaled
   - Likely increase his PEEP in response to
rounding-up
 on exam, can
   increase support if needed
   3. Neuro:  Likely delirium as well as respiratory distress secondary to
   bronchospasm and volume as above
   - haldol 2.5mg q6h standing and prn; titrate upwards as needed
   - started fentanyl patch 100mcg daily yesterday
   - wean fentanyl gtt by half today: to 50 mcg/hour
   - avoid propofol and benzos
   4. PsA PNA:
   - Cefipime x 16days, starting on [**12-8**]
   5. VRE bacteremia:
   - Linezolid x 14day
   6. Renal:
   - Currently on CVVH; will discuss with renal regarding transition to
   intermittent HD.
   - CVVH line may need to come out given new fever (as above)
   7. CV:
   - evaluate with cath/ischemic evaluation in future when improved from
   pulmonary perspective
   8. GI:  ileus/partial obstruction, responds to methylnaltrexone
   - need to minimize narcotics; continue methylnaltrexone
   - trophic feeds

   Currently, stable and off pressors.
   - follow blood, urine cultures

   # Hypotension: Has been normotensive recently, plan is to run CVVH
   until he drops his pressure and then give some fluid back if necessary.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Biggest problem with weaning currently
   is mental status. Pt. gets agitated w/ withdrawl of sedation. Will
   likely need to be switched from Fentanyl to dilaudid and then weaned
   down. Pt. will need to be uncomfortable and agitated for some period of
   time while the sedation is weaned but may consider pressedex for a
   brief period while weaning opiates.
   - D/c haldol and fentanyl
   - Increased wheezing likely contributing to agitation, increase
   broncodilators and start Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - Cefepime for 16 day course from [**12-8**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Fevers: The patient continues to have spiking fevers, but blood cultures have remained negative, making it unlikely to be a line infection. However, it could be due to nosocomial pneumonia (NMS) with Haloperidol given for rigidity or serotonergic syndrome caused by bupropion and linezolid.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been normotensive recently, and the plan is to continue with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) until the blood pressure drops, then give some fluid back if necessary.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's biggest problem is weaning from mechanical ventilation due to mental status changes, agitation, and withdrawal from sedation. The plan is to switch from fentanyl to dilaudid and then wean down the sedation gradually. The patient may need to be uncomfortable and agitated for some time while weaning off the opiates.

4. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia: The patient had a positive blood culture for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. He presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including fever, hypotension, hypoxemic respiratory failure, VRE bacteremia, anemia, constipation, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and depression. He is currently being treated in the ICU and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent line infection: The patient has been on CVVH and receiving antibiotics, but there is a possibility of persistent line infection leading to ongoing fevers and bacteremia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Agitation on the ventilator and increased wheezing may indicate worsening lung infection.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid removal through diuresis. However, there is a possibility of fluid overload contributing to his respiratory failure.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient is unable to go off CVVH due to rising creatinine levels. Continued renal dysfunction may be a complication.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's"

   67M with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1; course complicated by PsA VAP
   and VRE bacteremia; now s/p trach.
   1. Fever: has been low-grade until midnight, now with fever to 101.2.
   Blood cultures negative since [**12-11**], when he grew enterococcus.  Also
   with PSA in sputum.  CXR without a clear new infiltrate.
   Hemodynamically stable off pressors.
   - continue same abx for now: linezolid, cefepime
   - repeat UA, urine culture, sputum culture
   - check c. diff
   - monitor hemodynamics; if hypotensive, will likely need to d/c CVVH
   line since it was placed on [**12-11**]
   2. Respiratory failure:  barriers to breathing spontaneously include
   VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance and persistent
   encephalopathy with significant sedation.  Net negative over 3 L since
   yesterday, pressures tolerating volume removal. CVP 7 this morning
   (range 7-23)
   - Decrease goal CVVH rate: neg 100/ hour
   - Continue bronchodilators, fluticasone inhaled
   - Likely increase his PEEP in response to
rounding-up
 on exam, can
   increase support if needed
   3. Neuro:  Likely delirium as well as respiratory distress secondary to
   bronchospasm and volume as above
   - haldol 2.5mg q6h standing and prn; titrate upwards as needed
   - started fentanyl patch 100mcg daily yesterday
   - wean fentanyl gtt by half today: to 50 mcg/hour
   - avoid propofol and benzos
   4. PsA PNA:
   - Cefipime x 16days, starting on [**12-8**]
   5. VRE bacteremia:
   - Linezolid x 14day
   6. Renal:
   - Currently on CVVH; will discuss with renal regarding transition to
   intermittent HD.
   - CVVH line may need to come out given new fever (as above)
   7. CV:
   - evaluate with cath/ischemic evaluation in future when improved from
   pulmonary perspective
   8. GI:  ileus/partial obstruction, responds to methylnaltrexone
   - need to minimize narcotics; continue methylnaltrexone
   - trophic feeds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS thought to be secondary to H1N1. He has a history of PSA VAP and VRE bacteremia, and has undergone tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Fever: The patient's fever has been low-grade until midnight, now with a fever of 101.2. Blood cultures have been negative since December 11th, when Enterococcus was grown. Also, PSA was detected in the sputum. The chest X-ray does not show a clear new infiltrate.
- Continue the same antibiotics for now, including linezolid and cefepime.
- Repeat urine analysis, urine culture, and sputum culture.
- Check for Clostridium difficile.
- Monitor hemodynamics; if hypotensive, the CVVH line may need to be discontinued since it was placed on December 11th.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has several barriers to breathing spontaneously, including VAP, volume overload, increased airway resistance, and persistent encephalopathy with significant sedation. The net negative fluid balance over the past day is 3 liters since yesterday, with a CVP of 7 this morning (range 7-23).
- Decrease the goal CVVH rate to negative 100 mL/hour.
- Continue bronchodilators and inhaled fluticasone.
- Increase P"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suspected to be caused by H1N1 influenza, and he also had acute kidney injury (AKI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). His recent vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 143/58 mmHg to 151/70 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has had a persistent low-grade fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying condition.
2. Blood cultures negative since 12/11: This suggests that there may no longer be a bloodstream infection; however, the recent fever could indicate a new infection or a complication.
3. PsA VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia secondary to Pseudomonas aeruginosa"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1; course complicated by PsA VAP
   and VRE bacteremia; now s/p trach.
   1. Fever: has been low-grade until midnight, now with fever to 101.2.
   Blood cultures negative since [**12-11**], when he grew enterococcus.  Also
   with PSA in sputum.  CXR without a clear new infiltrate.
   Hemodynamically stable off pressors.
   - continue same abx for now: linezolid, cefepime
   - repeat UA, urine culture, sputum culture
   - check c. diff
   - monitor hemodynamics; if hypotensive, will likely need to d/c CVVH
   line since it was placed on [**12-11**]
   2. Respiratory failure:  barriers to breathing spontaneously include
   VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance and persistent
   encephalopathy with significant sedation.  Net negative over 3 L since
   yesterday, pressures tolerating volume removal. CVP 7 this morning
   (range 7-23)
   - Decrease goal CVVH rate: neg 100/ hour
   - Continue bronchodilators, fluticasone inhaled
   - Likely increase his PEEP in response to
rounding-up
 on exam, can
   increase support if needed
   3. Neuro:  Likely delirium as well as respiratory distress secondary to
   bronchospasm and volume as above
   - haldol 2.5mg q6h standing and prn; titrate upwards as needed
   - started fentanyl patch 100mcg daily yesterday
   - wean fentanyl gtt by half today: to 50 mcg/hour
   - avoid propofol and benzos
   4. PsA PNA:
   - Cefipime x 16days, starting on [**12-8**]
   5. VRE bacteremia:
   - Linezolid x 14day
   6. Renal:
   - Currently on CVVH; will discuss with renal regarding transition to
   intermittent HD.
   - CVVH line may need to come out given new fever (as above)
   7. CV:
   - evaluate with cath/ischemic evaluation in future when improved from
   pulmonary perspective
   8. GI:  ileus/partial obstruction, responds to methylnaltrexone
   - need to minimize narcotics; continue methylnaltrexone
   - trophic feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa antibiotics and is currently receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, calcium gluconate, KCl, heparin sodium, and lorazepam. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 79-151 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.7, potassium (K+) at 5.9 meq/L, and low levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) at 7.7 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range. The patient's blood cultures show growth of Acinetobacter baumannii. The patient has been receiving appropriate antibiotics, but there is still evidence of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and positive blood cultures suggest ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt management.
2. Acinetobacter baumannii infection: The patient's blood cultures indicate the presence"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS thought secondary to H1N1; course complicated by PsA VAP
   and VRE bacteremia; now s/p trach.
   1. Fever: has been low-grade until midnight, now with fever to 101.2.
   Blood cultures negative since [**12-11**], when he grew enterococcus.  Also
   with PSA in sputum.  CXR without a clear new infiltrate.
   Hemodynamically stable off pressors.
   - continue same abx for now: linezolid, cefepime
   - repeat UA, urine culture, sputum culture
   - check c. diff
   - monitor hemodynamics; if hypotensive, will likely need to d/c CVVH
   line since it was placed on [**12-11**]
   2. Respiratory failure:  barriers to breathing spontaneously include
   VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance and persistent
   encephalopathy with significant sedation.  Net negative over 3 L since
   yesterday, pressures tolerating volume removal. CVP 7 this morning
   (range 7-23)
   - Decrease goal CVVH rate: neg 100/ hour
   - Continue bronchodilators, fluticasone inhaled
   - Likely increase his PEEP in response to
rounding-up
 on exam, can
   increase support if needed
   3. Neuro:  Likely delirium as well as respiratory distress secondary to
   bronchospasm and volume as above
   - haldol 2.5mg q6h standing and prn; titrate upwards as needed
   - started fentanyl patch 100mcg daily yesterday
   - wean fentanyl gtt by half today: to 50 mcg/hour
   - avoid propofol and benzos
   4. PsA PNA:
   - Cefipime x 16days, starting on [**12-8**]
   5. VRE bacteremia:
   - Linezolid x 14day
   6. Renal:
   - Currently on CVVH; will discuss with renal regarding transition to
   intermittent HD.
   - CVVH line may need to come out given new fever (as above)
   7. CV:
   - evaluate with cath/ischemic evaluation in future when improved from
   pulmonary perspective
   8. GI:  ileus/partial obstruction, responds to methylnaltrexone
   - need to minimize narcotics; continue methylnaltrexone
   - trophic feeds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diastolic heart failure, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suspected to be caused by H1N1 influenza, complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient also has recurrent fevers.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate 84 bpm (69-124 bpm), blood pressure 143/58 mmHg (84/48-151/70 mmHg), respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute (12-33 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 97% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's CVP is 16 mmHg (7-19 mmHg).

The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, heparin sodium, and others. He has also been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected infections.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate levels, along with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's electrolytes, including sodium, chloride, and magnesium, are within normal range. The patient's glucose levels are also within normal range.

The patient's recent imaging studies show no clear new infiltrate on chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Fever: The patient has been low-grade until midnight, now with a fever of 101.2°F. Blood cultures negative since December 11th, when he grew enterococcus. CXR without a clear new infiltrate.
2. Respiratory failure: Barriers to breathing spontaneously include VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance, and persistent encephalopathy with significant sedation. Net negative over 3 L since yesterday, pressures tolerating volume removal. CVP 7 this morning (range 7-23).
3. Neuro: Likely delirium as well as respiratory distress secondary to bronchospasm and volume as above.
4. PsA PNA: Cefepime x 16 days, starting on December 8th.
5. VRE bacteremia: Linezolid x 14 days.
6. Renal: Currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH); will discuss with renal regarding transition to intermittent hemodialysis (HD). CVVH line may need to come out given new fever (as above).
7. CV: Evaluate with cath/ischemic evaluation in future when improved from pulmonary perspective.
8. GI: Ileus/partial obstruction, responds to methylnaltrexone. Need to minimize narcotics; continue methylnaltrexone. Trophic feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia: The patient is already infected with VRE, which can lead to further complications if not treated appropriately.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. This increases the risk of developing AKI.
4. Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing delirium, which can be associated with the use of sedatives and other factors related to critical illness.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
7. Infection: The patient has recurrent fevers and positive blood cultures for enterococcus, indicating a possible ongoing infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   night, now pressures stable again and tolerating CVVH.
   - continue linezolid + flagyl
   - check another c. diff
   - d/c CVVH line, culture tip
   - consider changing cefepime to meropenem if still febrile p line out
   2. Respiratory failure:  barriers to breathing spontaneously include
   VAP, volume overload, increased airways resistance and persistent
   encephalopathy with significant sedation.  Net negative over 2.3 L

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suspected to be secondary to H1N1 infection, complicated by aspiration pneumonia (PsA), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and not responding to commands.

24-hour events include a new fever yesterday, pan-culture done with flagyl added, hypotension at 10 pm requiring a 250 cc bolus, and briefly on neoropine last night. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a net negative fluid balance of 2.3 liters since yesterday.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 143/58 to 151/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's physical examination shows decreased wheezes, scattered rales anteriorly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suspected to be secondary to H1N1 influenza, complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, along with recurrent fevers.

24-hour events include a new fever yesterday, pan-culture results negative, addition of Flagyl, hypotension at 10 pm requiring a 250 cc bolus, and decrease in fentanyl infusion.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including ARDS, VAP, VRE bacteremia, ileus/partial obstruction, dusky toes, and renal failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 143/58 mmHg to 79/48 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg.

   from NMS w/ haldol given rigidity vs. Fentanyl vs. buproprion causing
   serotonin syndrome w/ linezolid.  bacteria, fungal, drug fever.
   Currently, stable and off pressors.
   - follow blood, urine, HD line cultures
   -Changed fentanyl to dilaudid drip, now turn off drip with PRN boluses
   - Less likely to be NMS as symptoms started before haldol and normal CK
   - D/C buproprion
   - Keep cefepime for now as ESBLs would have grown by now, if HD
   unstable will restart meropenem
   - Replace HD line tomorrow

   # Hypotension: Has been normotensive recently.
   -Con
t to monitor
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Biggest problem with weaning currently
   is mental status. Pt. gets agitated w/ withdrawl of sedation. Will
   likely need to be switched from Fentanyl to dilaudid and then weaned
   down. Pt. will need to be uncomfortable and agitated for some period of
   time while the sedation is weaned but may consider pressedex for a
   brief period while weaning opiates.
   - D/C dilaudid gtt and use only PRN boluses for pain or withdrawal
   - PRN Haldol for agitations
   - Increased wheezing likely contributing to agitation, increased
   broncodilators and started Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - Cefepime for 16 day course from [**12-8**]
   - Restart HD vs. CVVH after line replacement
   - FiO2 to 40%
   # VRE bacteremia: Has not regrown VRE since line change but CVVH line
   was in place at time of bacteremia.
   - f/u cultures from CVVH line.
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Linazolid 2 week course from [**12-12**]
   - Consider TEE once stable
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control
   - on heparin gtt.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   # Anemia: Very low retic count, likely BM suppression from influenza
   and critical illness
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: likely [**2-6**] opiod.  Resolved initially with
   Methylnaltrexone, now slowing down but minimal residuals from NG

   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - Methylnaltrexone Q48 hr as needed
   -  continue tube feeds and PO meds today, advance TF as tolerated
   - Consider IP consult for PEG today given improvement
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c
   - continue HD after line holiday
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improving.  Likely [**2-6**] CRRT. HIT negative, normal
   fibrinogen
   -  heparin gtt given recent a.fib/flutt
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt
   -Restart coumadin after PEG
   - Amiodarone
   # Depression: Will hold Prozac while on linazolid and plan to restart
   once linzolid course complete
   - Decrease buproprion to half

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which may be related to multiple factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction: There is a possibility of small bowel obstruction, including intussusception or adhesions, which could be causing constipation and abdominal symptoms.

3. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, likely due to opioid use. Initial treatment with Methylnaltrexone was effective but symptoms are slowing down.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, a type of abnormal heart rhythm. Rate control is necessary, and heparin has been initiated.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is impaired, possibly due to prolonged bed rest and critical illness.

6. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's nutrition may be compromised, as indicated by anemia and low reticulocyte count.

7. Myocardial Infarction, Acute: The patient likely has some"

   # Fevers: Continues to spike fevers but blood cultures have remained
   negative, unlikely to be line infection but will pull HD line. Could be
   from NMS w/ haldol given rigidity vs. Fentanyl vs. buproprion causing
   serotonin syndrome w/ linezolid.  bacteria, fungal, drug fever.
   Currently, stable and off pressors.
   - follow blood, urine, HD line culturescultures
   -Changed fentanyl to dilaudid drip
   - Hold haldol for ? NMS
   - Half buproprion dose
   - Change to meropenem from cefepime
   # Hypotension: Has been normotensive recently, plan is to run CVVH
   until he drops his pressure and then give some fluid back if necessary.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Biggest problem with weaning currently
   is mental status. Pt. gets agitated w/ withdrawl of sedation. Will
   likely need to be switched from Fentanyl to dilaudid and then weaned
   down. Pt. will need to be uncomfortable and agitated for some period of
   time while the sedation is weaned but may consider pressedex for a
   brief period while weaning opiates.
   - D/c haldol and fentanyl
   - Increased wheezing likely contributing to agitation, increased
   broncodilators and started Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - Cefepime or meropenem for 16 day course from [**12-8**]
   - Restart HD vs. CVVH after line replacement
   # VRE bacteremia: Has not regrown VRE since line change but CVVH line
   was in place at time of bacteremia.
   - f/u cultures from CVVH line.
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Linazolid 2 week course from [**12-12**]
   - Consider TEE once stable
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control
   - on heparin gtt.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   # Anemia: Very low retic count, likely BM suppression from influenza
   and critical illness
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: likely [**2-6**] opiod.  Resolved initially with
   Methylnaltrexone, now slowing down but minimal residuals from NG
   suction
   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - Methylnaltrexone Q48 hr as needed
   -  continue tube feeds and PO meds today, advance TF as tolerated
   - Consider IP consult for PEG today given improvement
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c
   - continue HD after line holiday
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improving.  Likely [**2-6**] CRRT. HIT negative, normal
   fibrinogen
   -  heparin gtt given recent a.fib/flutt
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt
   -Restart coumadin after PEG
   - Amiodarone
   # Depression: Will hold Prozac while on linazolid and plan to restart
   once linzolid course complete
   - Decrease buproprion to half

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently stable and off pressors. The patient continues to spike fevers, which are unlikely to be due to a line infection but could be caused by neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with haloperidol, serotonin syndrome with bupropion and linezolid, or drug fever. Blood cultures have remained negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status is agitated, making it difficult to wean him off sedation. This may lead to confusion and delirium.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has constipation, which could be due to opioid use. This could potentially lead to small bowel obstruction.
3. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is likely experiencing some demand ischemia. This could lead to a myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Weaning him off the ventilator may be challenging due to agitation.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure"

   with fentanyl (direct serotonin agonist) in combination with Bupropion
   (serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Still with somnolence
   - discontinue dilaudid drip; can treat pain or withdrawal with prn
   boluses
   - Treat delirium with haldol if needed
   - Assess underlying respiratory status if develops agitation and
   consider ventilator changes for increased support as opposed to
   increased sedation.
   2.       Respiratory Failure:  improving with minimal support ([**5-9**],
   fiO2 .5)
   -          wean FiO2 to 0.4
   -          watch for signs of CHF as not being dialysed
   3.       PsA VAP:
   - Discontinue meropenem as no evidence for new VAP; plan 2 week course

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, thought to be secondary to H1N1 infection. His course has been complicated by PsA VAP and VRE bacteremia. He has been experiencing recurrent temperatures over the weekend, leading to expanded antibiotic coverage. His sedation was changed due to rigidity and concern for NMS or serotonin syndrome. The HD catheter was removed due to recurrent fevers, and a PICC line was placed today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological: There is doubt about NMS given normal CK levels, but there is a possibility of serotonin syndrome with fentanyl and Bupropion. The patient remains somnolent, so it is recommended to discontinue dilaudid drip and treat pain or withdrawal with prn boluses. Haldol can be used to treat delirium if needed, and underlying respiratory status should be assessed if agitation occurs, considering ventilator changes for increased support instead of increased sedation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving with minimal support. It is recommended to wean FiO2 to 0.4 and watch for signs of CHF as he is not being dialyzed.

3. PsA VAP: Meropenem should be discontinued as there is no evidence for new VAP. A 2-week course of cefepime is planned.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, secondary to H1N1, and complicated by PsA VAP and VRE line infection. He has been experiencing recurrent temperatures, leading to expanded antibiotic coverage. The patient's sedation was changed due to rigidity and concern for NMS or serotonin syndrome. The HD catheter was removed due to recurrent fevers, and a PICC line was placed today. 

24-hour events include temperature fluctuations over the weekend, leading to the expansion of antibiotic coverage. The patient's rigidity prompted a change in sedation due to concerns about NMS or serotonin syndrome. The HD catheter was removed in the setting of recurrent fevers, and a PICC line was placed.

Medications include hydromorphone (Dilaudid), heparin sodium, pantoprazole (Protonix), ASA, chlorhexidine, simvastatin, albuterol/atrovent, heparin, Epogen, Tylenol q6h, and Wellbutrin. The patient is also on amiodarone 400mg PO.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be somnolent and not responding to voice, with clear anterior fields and improving right lower lung field. CV examination shows R"

   from NMS w/ haldol given rigidity vs. Fentanyl vs. buproprion causing
   serotonin syndrome w/ linezolid.  bacteria, fungal, drug fever.
   Currently, stable and off pressors.
   - follow blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Changed fentanyl to dilaudid drip, now turn off drip with PRN boluses
   - Less likely to be NMS as symptoms started before haldol and normal CK
   - D/C buproprion
   - Linazolid/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and VRE.  [**Last Name (un) **] started
   [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**]
   - Replace HD line today
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Biggest problem with weaning currently
   is mental status. Pt. gets agitated w/ withdrawl of sedation. Currently
   weaning dilaudid.  Pt. will need to be uncomfortable and agitated for
   some period of time while the sedation is weaned but may consider
   pressedex for a brief period while weaning opiates.
   - D/C dilaudid gtt and use only PRN boluses for pain or withdrawal
   - PRN Haldol for agitations
   - Increased wheezing likely contributing to agitation, increased
   broncodilators and started Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Restart HD vs. CVVH after line replacement
   - FiO2 to 40%
   # VRE bacteremia: Has not regrown VRE since line change but CVVH line
   was in place at time of bacteremia.  CVVH, CVL and A-lines removed.
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Linazolid 2 week course from [**12-12**]
   - TEE

   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   # Anemia: Very low retic count, likely BM suppression from influenza
   and critical illness
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: likely [**2-6**] opiod.  Resolved initially with
   Methylnaltrexone, now slowing down but minimal residuals from NG
   suction
   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - Methylnaltrexone Q48 hr as needed
   - holding TF in anticipation of PEG today
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c
   - continue HD after line holiday
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improving.  Likely [**2-6**] CRRT. HIT negative, normal
   fibrinogen
   -  heparin gtt given recent a.fib/flutt
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; Restart coumadin after PEG
   - Amiodarone
   - resume home metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Depression: Will hold Prozac while on linazolid and plan to restart
   once linzolid course complete
   - Holding buproprion and prosac

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has been experiencing various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient continues to have spikes in fever, but blood cultures have remained negative, making it unlikely to be a line infection. However, there is a possibility of neurologic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome due to the medications Haldol and buproprion.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction: There is a possibility of small bowel obstruction, including intussusception or adhesions.

3. Constipation: The patient is likely experiencing opioid-induced constipation.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which may require rate control.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to prolonged bedrest or pressure ulcers.

6. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and nutritional support is required.

7. Myocardial Infarction, Acute: The patient likely has some demand ischemia, indicating possible acute myocardial infarction.

8. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and not"

   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF
   # Fevers: Continues to spike fevers but blood cultures have remained
   negative, unlikely to be line infection but will pull HD line. Could be
   from rigidity (see below) vs  bacteria, fungal, drug fever.  Currently,
   stable and off pressors.  Lines changed.
   - follow blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Linazolid/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and VRE.  [**Last Name (un) **] started
   [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**], copurse pending TTE and
   speciation of GNR in sputum culture
   - Replace HD line today
   # Agitation and rigidity: Somewhat improved on exam today.  Ddx
   includes seritonin syndrome, delerium, sedation effects, pain.  Less
   likely to be NMS as symptoms started before haldol and normal CK.
   Hypertension exists at baseline
   - Stopped Prosac and buproprion
   - Changed fentanyl to dilaudid drip, now turn off drip with PRN boluses
   - restart metoprolol, consider labetalol if not controlled.
   - D/C dilaudid gtt and use only PRN boluses for pain or withdrawal
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Biggest problem with weaning currently
   is mental status. Pt. gets agitated w/ withdrawl of sedation. Currently
   weaning dilaudid.  Pt. will need to be uncomfortable and agitated for
   some period of time while the sedation is weaned but may consider
   pressedex for a brief period while weaning opiates.
   - Increased wheezing likely contributing to agitation, increased
   broncodilators and started Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Start  HD after line replacement
   # VRE bacteremia: Has not regrown VRE since line change but CVVH line
   was in place at time of bacteremia.  CVVH, CVL and A-lines removed.
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Linazolid 2 week course from [**12-12**]
   - TTE/TEE
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control.  He had 48 hours of heparin.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   # Anemia: Very low retic count, likely BM suppression from influenza
   and critical illness
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: likely [**2-6**] opiod.  Resolved initially with
   Methylnaltrexone, now slowing down but minimal residuals from NG
   suction
   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - Methylnaltrexone Q48 hr as needed
   - holding TF in anticipation of PEG today
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c
   - continue HD after line holiday
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improving.  Likely [**2-6**] CRRT. HIT negative, normal
   fibrinogen
   -  heparin gtt given recent a.fib/flutt
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; Restart coumadin after PEG
   - Amiodarone
   - resume home metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Depression: Will hold Prozac while on linazolid and plan to restart
   once linzolid course complete
   - Holding buproprion and prosac

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, agitation, and rigidity, and there is a concern for delirium or serotonin syndrome. The patient also has small bowel obstruction, constipation, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, and severe hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's mental status is a concern, and he is experiencing agitation and rigidity. This could be due to delirium or serotonin syndrome.
2. Serotonin Syndrome: The patient has been taking bupropion and fluoxetine, both of which can cause serotonin syndrome when combined. Symptoms include agitation, confusion, fever, sweating, tremors, and increased reflexes.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has small bowel obstruction, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which may be related to opioid use.
5. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS likely due to unconfirmed H1N1 infection. The patient's course has been complicated by VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) and VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococci) bacteremia. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, sedatives, and respiratory support. The patient's condition is critical, and they remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a component of ARDS and is being managed with bronchodilators and titration of ventilation support as needed for comfort and work of breathing (WOB).
2. Neurological issues: The patient has increased rigidity and altered mental status, which may indicate neurologic involvement. An MRI and EEG have been planned, and a neuroconsult may be considered pending these results and the patient's clinical status.
3. VAP/PNA: The patient has recurrent PsA (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and new infiltrates, indicating a possible VAP/PNA (ventilator-associated pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia). Antibiotic therapy with meropenem is being continued, and culture data will guide further antibiotic adjustments.
4. VRE bacteremia: The patient has cleared VRE bacteremia, but linezolid will be continued for an additional 2 weeks.
5. CV issues: The patient has hypertension and atrial flutter. Metop"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, likely due to unconfirmed H1N1 infection. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including placement of a PICC line, discontinuation of central line, and weaning off dilaudid. 

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line yesterday, which was discontinued today. The patient has required prn doses of dilaudid since yesterday. There was an increase in pressure support yesterday for increased work of breathing (WOB) and wheezing. The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy.

Allergies include a sulfa allergy. The last doses of antibiotics given were metronidazole on 12/18/2102 at 4:00 AM, cefepime on 12/18/2102 at 8:20 AM, linezolid on 12/19/2102 at 12:00 AM, and meropenem on 12/19/2102 at 4:00 AM.

   # Fevers: Again growing pseudamonas from sputum, could also be a
   component of serotonin syndrome.
   - follow blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Switch linezolid to daptomycin/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and
   VRE.  [**Last Name (un) **] started [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**],

   - TEE today
   # Agitation and rigidity: Stable, given he was on fluoxetine,
   buproprion and then started on linezolid within several days of
   stopping his fluoxetine while being on fentanyl strongly suspect
   serotonin syndrome. Doubt nosocomial meningitis as is extremely rare
   and pt. is rigid throughout, not just his neck.
   - Stopped Prosac and buproprion
   - restart metoprolol, consider labetalol if not controlled
   hypertension.
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS.
   - Neurology consult re: serotonin syndrome
   - Consider cyproheptadine
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Weaning is currently dependent on
   mental status, he still has positive urine benzos. He may still have a
   pseudamonas PNA.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to mental status changes and positive urine benzos.

2. Septic shock: The patient has a history of growing pseudomonas from sputum, indicating a possible infection. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia (VRE).

3. Serotonin syndrome: The patient is suspected to have serotonin syndrome due to the combination of fluoxetine, bupropion, and linezolid use. This can lead to agitation, rigidity, and hyperreflexia.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is currently on dialysis and has a rising creatinine level. It is important to monitor renal function closely and determine the cause of acute renal failure.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and may have demand ischemia. Rate control is essential, and further evaluation with a cardiac catheterization is recommended.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to bone marrow suppression from critical illness. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and appropriate transfusion should be considered.

7. Constipation: The patient previously experienced constipation, which has resolved. It is important"

   # Fevers: Continues to spike fevers but blood cultures have remained
   negative, unlikely to be line infection but will pull HD line. Could be
   from rigidity (see below) vs  bacteria, fungal, drug fever.  Currently,
   stable and off pressors.  Lines changed.
   - follow blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Linazolid/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and VRE.  [**Last Name (un) **] started
   [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**], copurse pending TTE and
   speciation of GNR in sputum culture
   - Replace HD line today
   # Agitation and rigidity: Somewhat improved on exam today.  Ddx
   includes seritonin syndrome, delerium, sedation effects, pain.  Less
   likely to be NMS as symptoms started before haldol and normal CK.
   Hypertension exists at baseline
   - Stopped Prosac and buproprion
   - Changed fentanyl to dilaudid drip, now turn off drip with PRN boluses
   - restart metoprolol, consider labetalol if not controlled.
   - D/C dilaudid gtt and use only PRN boluses for pain or withdrawal
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Biggest problem with weaning currently
   is mental status. Pt. gets agitated w/ withdrawl of sedation. Currently
   weaning dilaudid.  Pt. will need to be uncomfortable and agitated for
   some period of time while the sedation is weaned but may consider
   pressedex for a brief period while weaning opiates.
   - Increased wheezing likely contributing to agitation, increased
   broncodilators and started Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Start  HD after line replacement
   # VRE bacteremia: Has not regrown VRE since line change but CVVH line
   was in place at time of bacteremia.  CVVH, CVL and A-lines removed.
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Linazolid 2 week course from [**12-12**]
   - TTE/TEE
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control.  He had 48 hours of heparin.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU
   # Anemia: Very low retic count, likely BM suppression from influenza
   and critical illness
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: likely [**2-6**] opiod.  Resolved initially with
   Methylnaltrexone, now slowing down but minimal residuals from NG
   suction
   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - Methylnaltrexone Q48 hr as needed
   - holding TF in anticipation of PEG today
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c
   - continue HD after line holiday
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improving.  Likely [**2-6**] CRRT. HIT negative, normal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. 

The patient continues to spike fevers, but blood cultures have remained negative. There is a possibility of line infection or other causes such as bacteria, fungal, or drug fever. Antibiotics have been changed to cover possible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). 

The patient is also experiencing agitation and rigidity, which could be due to serotonin syndrome, delirium, sedation effects, or pain. The agitation is making it difficult to wean off the ventilator. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of VRE bacteremia, but it has not regrown since the line change. 

The patient also has coronary artery disease and is likely experiencing some demand ischemia. Rate control is recommended, and he had 48 hours of heparin. 

There are several other medical complications mentioned in the note, including anemia, constipation, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, depression, and others. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment accordingly"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS, likely due to H1N1; course complicated by persistent
   respiratoy failure requiring tracheostomy, VAP, VRE bacteremia, renal
   failure.
   1.       Respiratory Failure:
   -          try [**5-9**], HD today, goal of  negative
   2.       Neuro:  concern for rigidity, feves, clonus, perhaps
   hyperreflexia
 possible serotonin syndrome
   - consult neuro
   - discontinue linezolid
   - discontinue dialudid; give prn oxycodone or morphine if evidence of
   pain
   - holding wellbutrin and prozac
   3.       PsA PNA:
   -          awaiting culture data; currently on meropenem. Will define
   course.
   4.       VRE Bacteremia
   - change linezolid to daptomycin
   - TEE today
   5.       Renal: improving urine output overnight; now 100ml/hr
   -          likely HD today, but perhaps with improvement of his UOP
   moving towards renal recovery.
   6.       GI: can restart tube feeds today
   7.       CV:  afib, CAD
   - metoprolol 50mg tid; increase dose with BP and HR room
   - amiodarone daily from [**Hospital1 **]
   - eventual ischemic evaluation
   - restart heparin drip; restart coumadin

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS likely secondary to H1N1, complicated hospital course. The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation due to persistent respiratory failure and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has a VRE bacteremia and renal failure. The patient's neurologic status is concerning for possible serotonin syndrome. The patient's past medical history includes atrial flutter, coronary artery disease, and previous strokes. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal chronic microvascular changes and an old right cerebellar infarct. The patient's current plan includes continuing with meropenem for PsA PNA, changing linezolid to daptomycin for VRE bacteremia, performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and potentially initiating hemodialysis (HD) based on urine output. Other plans include restarting tube feeds, glycemic control with insulin sliding scale, heparin drip, and restarting Coumadin for cardiovascular issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS, likely due to H1N1; course complicated by persistent
   respiratoy failure requiring tracheostomy, VAP, VRE bacteremia, renal
   failure.
   1.       Respiratory Failure:
   - try [**5-9**] and attempt some time on trach mask today; restart PSV if
   evidence of increased WOB
   - HD today with negative
   2.       Neuro:  concern for rigidity, feves, clonus, perhaps
   hyperreflexia
 possible serotonin syndrome
   - consult neuro
   - discontinue linezolid
   - discontinue dialudid; give prn oxycodone or morphine if evidence of
   pain
   - holding wellbutrin and prozac
   3.       PsA PNA:
   - awaiting culture data; currently on meropenem. Will define course.
   4.       VRE Bacteremia
   - change linezolid to daptomycin
   - TEE today
   5.       Renal: improving urine output overnight; now 100ml/hr
   - likely HD today, but perhaps with improvement of his UOP moving
   towards renal recovery.
   6.       GI: can restart tube feeds today
   7.       CV:  afib, CAD
   - metoprolol 50mg tid; increase dose with BP and HR room
   - amiodarone daily from [**Hospital1 **]
   - eventual ischemic evaluation
   - restart heparin drip; restart coumadin

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) likely secondary to H1N1 influenza. The patient has had a complicated hospital course and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with atrial flutter, blood pressure ranging from 162/76 mmHg to 179/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube in CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased hematocrit and fibrinogen levels. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Liver function tests are within normal limits, while renal function tests indicate renal failure. Other lab results show elevated lactate levels and elevated cardiac enzymes.

Imaging studies reveal chronic microvascular changes and an old right cerebellar infarct in the brain, as well as sphenoid sinusitis. Microbiology reports indicate positive PsA in sputum culture and negative NGTD in blood culture.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy,"

   Imaging: TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or mass/thrombus is seen in
   the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the right atrium/right atrial
   appendage. The right atrial appendage ejection velocity is depressed
   (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
   are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta
   (to 32cm from the incisors). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened with focal thickening of the right coronary cusp. No masses
   or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation with normal valve
   morphology. No 2D echo evidence of endocarditis.

   # Fevers: Again growing pseudamonas from sputum, could also be a
   component of serotonin syndrome.
   - follow blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Switched linezolid to daptomycin/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and
   VRE.  [**Last Name (un) **] started [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**],

   # Leukocytosis: New today. CXR relatively unchanged.
   -Blood,urine, sputum cx and check c.diff.
   # Agitation and rigidity: Stable, given he was on fluoxetine,
   buproprion and then started on linezolid within several days of
   stopping his fluoxetine while being on fentanyl strongly suspect
   serotonin syndrome. Doubt nosocomial meningitis as is extremely rare
   and pt. is rigid throughout, not just his neck.
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, consider labetalol if not controlled
   hypertension.
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Weaning is currently dependent on
   mental status, he still has positive urine benzos. He may still have a
   pseudamonas PNA. Now with slight tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis.
   - f/u sensis
   - PRN morphine for signs of pain or tachypnea
   - broncodilators and started Inh fluticasone; combivent standing

   was in place at time of bacteremia.  CVVH, CVL and A-lines removed.
   Catheter tip cultures are pending. TTE not significantly changed.
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Switched linezolid to daptomycin
   - TEE negative
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control.  He had 48 hours of heparin.

   - holding TF s/p PEG
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c,
   but UOP rising now, may be post ATN diuresis.
   - continue HD after line holiday
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, complicated by VAP and VRE bacteremia, persistent depressed mental status, and suspected recurrent PsA PNA. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, using a tracheostomy tube, and receiving oxygen supplementation with FiO2 at 50%. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/58 mmHg to 171/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and SpO2 at 100%. The patient has a history of encephalopathy and renal failure, and has received multiple antibiotics for his infections. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of ARDS, VAP, and VRE bacteremia, indicating a high risk for further infections. The ongoing fevers suggest that there may still be an active infection present.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, as indicated by his need for mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure if the VAP is not effectively treated.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient has persistent depressed mental status, which could be related to prolonged sedation and renal failure. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration if the underlying causes are not addressed.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and the need for intermittent hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function if the underlying causes are not treated.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to prolonged immobilization and the presence of multiple lines and catheters. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including respiratory, neurological, renal, and infectious complications. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to address these potential complications and improve the patient's condition."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, complicated by VAP and VRE bacteremia, persistent depressed mental status, and recurrent PsA PNA. The patient's medical history includes a history of encephalopathy and allergies to sulfa medications. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/58 mmHg to 171/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a weight of 87.3 kg.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,706 mL, including 778 mL through IV fluids, and an output of 5,325 mL, including 1,125 mL of urine. The respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 545 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 5.9 to 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 21.3% to 23.1%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 228 to 295 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 1.5 to 4.1 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 103 to 126 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate elevated levels of PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, LDH, and decreased levels of albumin and fibrinogen.

Imaging results show a normal systolic function with mild/moderate mitral regurgitation on TEE, and an unchanged chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include:

1. ID: New PsA in sputum, persistent fevers. Continue meropenem and send cdiff; LFTs, Amylase/lipase. Hold on LP for now.
2. VRE Bacteremia: Cultures negative, TEE negative. Course of daptomycin for 14 days.
3. Respiratory Failure: Trial of [**5-9**]. Can assess for possible trach mask trial today.
4. Neuro: Suspect persistent encephalopathy related to prolonged sedation in setting of renal failure, etc.
5. CV: 
6. Renal: HD yesterday. Continue intermittent HD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Prolonged sedation leading to persistent encephalopathy.
- VRE bacteremia and the risk of spreading the infection.
- Respiratory failure and the need for further respiratory support.
- Recurrent PsA PNA and the risk of respiratory infection.
- Renal failure and the need for dialysis.
- Cardiovascular complications due to the presence of atrial fibrillation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition, administer appropriate antibiotics, provide respiratory support, manage fluid balance, and consider further interventions such as tracheostomy trial, dialysis, and neurologic evaluation."

   # Fevers: Likely infectious, but serotonin syndrome could be
   contributing.  TEE negative for endocarditis.  Lines have been changed.
   - consider empiric antifungal, ID consult
   - repeat sputum culture
   - follow blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Switched linezolid to daptomycin/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and
   VRE.  [**Last Name (un) **] started [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**] for

   - TEE negative for endocarditits.
   # Leukocytosis: New today. CXR relatively unchanged.
   -Blood,urine, sputum cx and check c.diff.
   # Agitation and rigidity: Stable, given he was on fluoxetine,
   buproprion and then started on linezolid within several days of
   stopping his fluoxetine while being on fentanyl strongly suspect
   serotonin syndrome. Doubt nosocomial meningitis as is extremely rare
   and pt. is rigid throughout, not just his neck.
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Weaning is currently dependent on
   mental status, he still has positive urine benzos. He may still have a
   pseudamonas PNA. Now with slight tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis.
   - f/u sensitivities
   - PRN morphine for signs of pain or tachypnea
   - broncodilators and started Inh fluticasone; combivent standing
   - meropenem
   - Start  HD
   # VRE bacteremia: Has not regrown VRE since line change but CVVH line
   was in place at time of bacteremia.  CVVH, CVL and A-lines removed.
   Catheter tip cultures are pending. TTE/TEE without endocarditis
   - Hold daily cultures as has been negative for past 2 days.
   - Switched linezolid to daptomycin
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control.  He had 48 hours of heparin.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness.
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Started Epo
   # Constipation: Resolved, holding opiates unless uncomfortable
   - continue colace/senna/miralax/bisacodyl
   - holding TF s/p PEG
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c,
   but UOP rising now, may be post ATN diuresis.
   - continue HD after line holiday
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; Restart coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.
- The patient has been experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia, which are concerning for possible infections or serotonin syndrome.
- The patient has leukocytosis and a new respiratory infection indicated by Gram-negative rods in the sputum culture.
- The patient's agitation and rigidity may be due to serotonin syndrome, especially considering the recent medication changes including fluoxetine and bupropion.
- The patient's respiratory failure is dependent on mental status, and there may still be a pseudomonas pneumonia.
- The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia, but it has not regrown since the line change.
- The patient has coronary artery disease with some demand ischemia and should have rate control.
- The patient has anemia likely due to bone marrow suppression from critical illness.
- The patient has constipation, which has resolved, and will continue with bowel regimen.
- The patient has acute renal failure and is on dialysis, with plans to continue after line holiday.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation currently in a rate-controlled flutter, and digoxin is being held.
- The patient's depression"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been experiencing various medical complications.

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is showing signs of confusion and agitation, which may be due to several factors such as infection, medication side effects (serotonin syndrome), or other underlying conditions.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): There is a suspicion of small bowel obstruction, possibly caused by adhesions or intussusception. This can lead to intestinal ischemia and potentially result in necrosis if not promptly addressed.

3. Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation, which may be related to medications, decreased mobility, or other factors. It is important to manage this condition to prevent further complications.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation but is currently in a rate-controlled flutter state. Appropriate management of his cardiac rhythm should be continued.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, potentially due to prolonged bed rest, poor nutrition, or impaired circulation. Regular skin assessments and appropriate interventions are necessary to"

The patient's current condition includes delirium/confusion, small bowel obstruction, constipation, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 94/53 mmHg to 147/78 mmHg, heart rate between 69-127 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure, complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing fevers, persistent GNR in sputum, and significant stool output. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and heated humidification (HD). His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/53 mmHg to 156/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa antibiotics and is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy. His current medications include Linezolid, Daptomycin, Meropenem, Heparin sodium, Simvastatin, Tylenol q6h, Amiodarone, Metoprolol, Coumadin, and Albuterol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates ongoing difficulty in breathing and oxygenation. Continued support with mechanical ventilation and adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary.
2. Persistent Fevers: The presence of fevers despite antibiotic therapy suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Further workup, including repeat cultures and imaging studies, may be required to identify the source of infection"

   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: Likely infectious, given WBC count, but serotonin syndrome
   could be contributing.  TEE negative for endocarditis.  Lines have been
   changed.  Remaining sources could include sinusitis seen on MRI, fungal
   infection of skin/lung (although not usually a cause of such fevers and
   inflammation), unseen intraabdominal abscess, drug reaction.
   Meningitis unlikely given that patient has been on antibiotics.
   - will treat with fluconazole for 5 days empiric therapy as well as
   topical chlotrimazole
   - Afrin to relieve sinus congestion, sinusitis should be covered by
   current antibiotics
   - will do CT with contrast sinus to abdomen on [**12-23**] if not improving
   to look for other source
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: daptomycin/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and VRE.

   complete.
   # Agitation and rigidity: Stable, given he was on fluoxetine,
   buproprion and then started on linezolid within several days of
   stopping his fluoxetine while being on fentanyl strongly suspect
   serotonin syndrome. Doubt nosocomial meningitis as is extremely rare
   and pt. is rigid throughout, not just his neck.
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Much improved, tolerating trach mask.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. He presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/73 to 166/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation, using 50% FiO2, and has a recent respiratory syncytial virus infection. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, liver enzymes, and electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, trace pitting edema, soft abdomen, and cogwheel rigidity with clonus in both feet. Neurological examination shows no response to commands.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has shown improvement in tolerating the tracheostomy mask.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has received appropriate antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted with ARDS from presumed H1N1 infection. The patient's course has been complicated by VAP (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), VRE bacteremia, persistent respiratory failure, and fevers of unclear etiology. The patient has shown low-grade fevers and leukocytosis, with ongoing issues including respiratory failure and unclear etiology of fevers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure, which could potentially worsen if not properly managed. This may require adjustments in ventilatory support and monitoring of oxygenation levels.
2. VAP (Pseudomonas aeruginosa): The presence of VAP indicates a possible healthcare-associated infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas species should be considered, along with measures to prevent further infection such as elevating the head of the bed, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory hygiene.
3. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has completed a course of daptomycin for VRE bacteremia. Continued monitoring for signs of relapse or new infections is necessary. It is important to follow infection control measures to prevent the spread of VRE within the healthcare setting.
4. Unclear Etiology of Fevers: The patient has persistent low-grade fevers despite extensive workup including negative pan scan, TEE, and other cultures. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying cause of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with ARDS, VAP (PsA), VRE bacteremia, persistent respiratory failure, and fevers of unclear etiology. The patient has been treated for various conditions including VRE bacteremia, PsA PNA, and anemia. The patient also shows signs of rigidity, which is unclear in etiology.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have persistent respiratory failure despite weaning attempts. This could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

2. Fevers and Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers and leukocytosis. These symptoms may indicate an ongoing infection or an inflammatory response. Further investigation is required to determine the underlying cause.

3. Rigidity: The patient's rigidity is of unclear etiology. It could be related to serotonin syndrome, Parkinson's disease exacerbation, or a neurological complication of the presumed H1N1 infection. Close monitoring and neurologic input are necessary to determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment.

4. Anemia: The patient is likely experiencing critical illness-related anemia, possibly due to renal issues. Minimizing blood draws and maintaining hemoglobin levels above 21 are recommended.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient"

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: Serotonin syndrome vs. drug fever vs. occult abdominal
   infection. C.diff recurrently negative.  Doubt that yeast in sputum is
   infection. Rash on back suggestive of drug rash
   - repeat diff on CBC.
   - d/c fluc
   - Afrin to relieve sinus congestion, sinusitis should be covered by
   current antibiotics
   - will consider CT with contrast sinus to abdomen on today if not
   improving to look for other source
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: daptomycin/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and VRE.
   [**Last Name (un) **] started [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**] for 14
   days.  Could consider d/c of antibiotics on [**12-26**] once VRE course
   complete.
   # rigidity: Stable, consider H1N1 induced parkinsonism. No known cases
   so far, but occurred with the [**2011**] virus. Mental status improving
   significantly. Urine benzos negative. Could still be serotonin syndrome
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Much improved, tolerating trach mask.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control.  He had 48 hours of heparin.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness.
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Started Epo
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c,
   but UOP rising now, may be post ATN diuresis.
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line this week if afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome
   - Holding buproprion and prosac

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently experiencing fevers, rigidity, hyperreflexia, and small bowel obstruction. 

The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities such as CHF, COPD, Afib, and CAD. He has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. 

The patient's current symptoms include hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is also experiencing rigidity and hyperreflexia, which may indicate serotonin syndrome or drug-induced parkinsonism. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and creatinine (Cr) levels, indicating possible infection, anemia, and renal dysfunction, respectively. The blood culture is negative for bacteria but shows moderate growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and sparse growth of yeast. 

The patient's imaging studies include a CT scan with contrast from December 19th, which may show other sources of infection or pathology. 

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for possible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, which can be a sign of delirium or confusion. This may be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or other underlying conditions.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has a history of constipation and is currently experiencing symptoms suggestive of small bowel obstruction, including abdominal pain and distension. Further evaluation with imaging studies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

3. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI): Given the patient's history of CAD and current symptoms, there is a possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and an electrocardiogram (ECG) would be important in assessing this possibility.

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. It is crucial to monitor oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely, and adjustments to the ventilator settings may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with ARDS from a presumed h1N1 infection. The patient's course has been complicated by VAP (PsA), VRE bacteremia, persistent respiratory failure, and fevers of unclear etiology. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing ongoing respiratory failure. The plan includes keeping the patient on total mouth (TM) and considering a repeat chest X-ray.
2. Low-grade fevers and leukocytosis: The patient has had extensive infectious workup, including negative results for pneumonia, central line infection, and Clostridium difficile. The concern here is possible drug fever or serotonin syndrome.
3. VRE Bacteremia: The patient is completing a course of daptomycin for VRE bacteremia.
4. PsA PNA: The patient is being treated with meropenem for PsA PNA.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely related to critical illness and renal issues. The goal is to maintain a hemoglobin concentration (Hct) above 21.
6. Rigidity: The patient has developed rigidity of unclear etiology, which may be related to serotonin syndrome or Parkinson's disease exacerbation.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has mild hypernatremia, and free water should be increased via tube feeds.

   Assessment and Plan
   67M admitted with ARDS from presumed h1N1 infection, course complicated
   by VAP (PsA ), VRE bacteremia, persistent respiratory failure and
   fevers of unclear etiology
   Primary issues include:
   # resp failure
   doing well with TM, OOB to chair, rest on AVC as needed, continues to
   have sig secretions, recs and repeat am cxr
   # low grade fevers and leukocytosis:  unclear etiology, has had
   extensive infectious w/u including neg pan scan (non IVC), TEE, cxs neg
   after clearing VRE, C diff neg X 3.
   --Sputum with PSA on [**Last Name (un) 614**] day 6, completing dapto course for VRE
   bacteremia, on afrin for  sinusitis
   --Concern for possible drug fever given rash (no eos urine or serum),
   serotonin syndrome given rigidity
   --low likelihood of hosp- acquired meningitis while on antibx so will
   hold on LP
   -- fever curve and leukocytosis trending down
   pan cx if spikes, consider repeat body scan to reassess for abscess if
   persists
   # PsA PNA:
   - complete [**Last Name (un) 614**] course day [**6-14**]
   # VRE bacteremia:
   - completing dapto course
   #Anemia:--likely critical illness/renal related
   - minimize blood draws, goal hct > 21
   # Rigidity
unclear etiology, developed during hospital course,?
   serotonin syndrome, ? parkinson

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted with ARDS from a presumed h1N1 infection. The course of treatment has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient continues to experience persistent respiratory failure and fevers of unclear etiology.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is ongoing respiratory failure. Despite being on therapeutic modalities such as tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, the patient still has significant secretions and requires frequent suctioning.

2. Low-grade fevers and leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers and leukocytosis, but the exact cause is unclear. Extensive infectious workup including negative pan scan (non-invasive ventilation), transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and chest X-ray (CXR) have been performed. The patient has also tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) three times.

3. PsA PNA: The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for PsA pneumonia, but there is concern for possible drug fever given the presence of a rash. The patient is currently on afrin for sinusitis.

4. VRE bacteremia: The patient has completed the dapto course for VRE"

   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: Serotonin syndrome vs. drug fever vs. occult abdominal
   infection. C.diff recurrently negative.  Doubt that yeast in sputum is
   infection. Rash on back suggestive of drug rash. Now growing
   stenotrophomonas in his sputum, likely VAP. Not covered by any current
   antibiotics
   - Allergic to sulfa, will start Ceftazidime for stenotrophomonas
   - Afrin to relieve sinus congestion, sinusitis should be covered by
   current antibiotics
   - will consider CT with contrast sinus to abdomen on today if not
   improving to look for other source
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: daptomycin/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and VRE.
   [**Last Name (un) **] started [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**] for 14
   days.  Could consider d/c of antibiotics on [**12-26**] once VRE course
   complete.
   # rigidity: Stable, consider H1N1 induced parkinsonism. No known cases
   so far, but occurred with the [**2011**] virus. Mental status improving
   significantly. Urine benzos negative. Could still be serotonin syndrome
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Much improved, tolerating trach mask.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control.  He had 48 hours of heparin.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness.
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Started Epo
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c,
   but UOP rising now, may be post ATN diuresis.
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line this week if afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: Serotonin syndrome vs. drug fever vs. occult abdominal
   infection. C.diff recurrently negative.  Doubt that yeast in sputum is
   infection. Rash on back suggestive of drug rash. Now growing
   stenotrophomonas in his sputum, likely VAP. Not covered by any current
   antibiotics. Afebrile x 48 hrs now.
   - Allergic to sulfa, will start Ceftazidime for stenotrophomonas, will
   confirm with family what the sulfa allergy is
   - Afrin to relieve sinus congestion, sinusitis should be covered by
   current antibiotics
   - will consider CT with contrast sinus to abdomen on today if not
   improving to look for other source
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: daptomycin/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and VRE.
   [**Last Name (un) **] started [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**] for 14
   days.  Could consider d/c of antibiotics on [**12-26**] once VRE course
   complete.
   - Given yeast in urine and sputum, will restart PO fluconazole for
   planned 5 day course
   # rigidity: Stable, consider H1N1 induced parkinsonism. No known cases
   so far, but occurred with the [**2011**] virus. Mental status improving
   significantly. Urine benzos negative. Could still be serotonin syndrome
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Much improved, tolerating trach mask.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control.  He had 48 hours of heparin.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness.
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Started Epo
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c,
   but UOP rising now, may be post ATN diuresis.
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line tomorrow
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome
   - Holding buproprion and prosac

   acute renal failure, VAP, VRE, persistent altered mental status.
   1.       VAP: now with stenotrophomonas, untreated.  Suspect this is
   cause of fevers. Also with PsA.
   - Add ceftaz per ID for stenotrophomonas (has sulfa allergy).  Will
   confirm with wife regarding sulfa allergy.
   - consider desensitization to bactrim if needed.
   - Continue meropenem through [**12-26**] for PsA PNA.

   - trach mask as tolerated
   - Pulmonary toilet with MIE if will tolerate; suctioning if needed.
   5.       Acute/Chronic renal failure
   - needs tunneled HD line once afebrile. Try for  tomorrow.
   - HD tomorrow
   6.       Atrial flutter:
   - start coumadin after HD line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), likely due to unconfirmed H1N1 influenza. His course has been complicated by acute renal failure, Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and persistent altered mental status.

The patient's recent events include low-grade fevers over the weekend, tolerance of tracheostomy mask until he developed tachypnea at 4 AM, and being put back on mechanical ventilation. He had a temperature of 100.2 last night and was afebrile otherwise. Stenotrophomonas was identified in his sputum.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax: 37.9°C (100.2°F), Tcurrent: 37.7°C (99.9°F), HR: 73 bpm (68-112 bpm), BP: 160/70 mmHg (93/59-177/89 mmHg), RR: 31 breaths per minute (27-50 breaths per minute), SpO2: 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with ARDS, likely due to unconfirmed H1N1; course complicated by
   acute renal failure, VAP, VRE, persistent altered mental status.
   1.       VAP: now with stenotrophomonas, untreated.  Suspect this is
   cause of fevers. Also with PsA.
   - Add ceftaz per ID for stenotrophomonas (has sulfa allergy).  Will
   confirm with wife regarding sulfa allergy.
   - consider desensitization to bactrim if needed.
   - Continue meropenem through [**12-26**] for PsA PNA.
   2.       [**Female First Name (un) 1354**]: urine/sputum/skin
   - fluconazole x 5 days
   3.       VRE bacteremia: s/p TTE/TEE without vegetation.
   - complete daptomycin tomorrow
   4.       Respiratory failure
   - trach mask as tolerated
   - Pulmonary toilet with MIE if will tolerate; suctioning if needed.
   5.       Acute/Chronic renal failure
   - needs tunneled HD line once afebrile. Try for  tomorrow.
   - HD tomorrow
   6.       Atrial flutter:
   - start coumadin after HD line
   7.       CAD:  outpatient cardiology follow-up
   8.       Neuro:  Slowly improving mental status, suspect resolving
   toxic-metabolic encephalopathy due to long-term sedation, infections,
   critical illness.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), likely due to unconfirmed H1N1 influenza. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure, Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and persistent altered mental status.

The patient continues to have low-grade fevers over the weekend and tolerated tracheostomy mask most of the previous day until he developed tachypnea at 4 AM and was placed back on the ventilator. The patient has been febrile at times, with a temperature of 100.2 last night.

Stenotrophomonas was identified from the sputum culture. The patient has a history of allergy to sulfa medications. The patient received daptomycin and meropenem as antibiotics, but both were stopped on 12/24/2102. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and pantoprazole (Protonix) as part of ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/70 to 177/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of"

   - treat stenotrophamonas
   - suction
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Started Epo
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line when afebrile
   - hold on tunneled line as was febrile overnight.
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line

- The patient has been experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia.
- Stenotrophomonas bacteria was found in the sputum, which is not responding to standard antibiotics.
- The patient has an allergy to sulfa, so he will be started on Ceftazidime for Stenotrophomonas.
- The patient's rigidity is improving, likely resolving from a drug effect.
- The patient had a flash pulmonary edema versus mucous plug causing hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- The patient's coronary artery disease enzymes are at baseline after flash.
- The patient has anemia due to bone marrow suppression from critical illness/renal failure.
- The patient has acute renal failure, with urine output increasing for one day but then dropping off.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently in a rate-controlled flutter, holding digoxin.
- The patient's depression may be related to serotonin syndrome.

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: Serotonin syndrome vs. drug fever vs. occult abdominal
   infection. C.diff recurrently negative.  Doubt that yeast in sputum is
   infection. Rash on back suggestive of drug rash. Now growing
   stenotrophomonas in his sputum, likely VAP. Not covered by any current
   antibiotics. Afebrile x 48 hrs now.
   - Allergic to sulfa, will start Ceftazidime for stenotrophomonas, will
   confirm with family what the sulfa allergy is
   - Afrin to relieve sinus congestion, sinusitis should be covered by
   current antibiotics
   - will consider CT with contrast sinus to abdomen on today if not
   improving to look for other source
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: daptomycin/meropenem for possible ESBL VAP and VRE.
   [**Last Name (un) **] started [**12-19**], Cefepime from [**Date range (1) 12163**], VRE from [**12-12**] for 14
   days.  Could consider d/c of antibiotics on [**12-26**] once VRE course
   complete.
   - Given yeast in urine and sputum, will restart PO fluconazole for
   planned 5 day course
   # rigidity: Stable, consider H1N1 induced parkinsonism. No known cases
   so far, but occurred with the [**2011**] virus. Mental status improving
   significantly. Urine benzos negative. Could still be serotonin syndrome
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Much improved, tolerating trach mask.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   # Coronary artery disease:  Patient likely has some demand ischemia and
   should ideally have rate control.  He had 48 hours of heparin.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness.
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Started Epo
   # Acute renal failure: Unable to go off dialysis as Cr rises after d/c,
   but UOP rising now, may be post ATN diuresis.
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line tomorrow
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome
   - Holding buproprion and prosac

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition has improved significantly, but he still requires tracheostomy mask support.
2. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, but his condition has stabilized.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is currently on dialysis and is expected to continue until his renal function improves.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed Stenotrophomonas in his sputum, which is likely VAP and not covered by any current antibiotics.
5. Yeast infection: The patient has yeast present in his sputum and urine, but it is uncertain if this is an infection.
6. Serotonin syndrome: The patient's rigidity and hyperreflexia may be indicative of serotonin syndrome, especially considering the use of certain medications.
7. Coronary artery disease: The patient likely has some demand ischemia, and it is important to control his"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He has been experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. The patient has a known allergy to sulfa medications and is currently being treated for Stenotrophomonas infection with ceftazidime. He is also receiving treatment for yeast in the urine and sputum with fluconazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening respiratory status and coarse bilateral bronchi-spurrants suggest the possibility of VAP. Stenotrophomonas infection has been identified, which may contribute to this complication.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient likely had flash pulmonary edema, as evidenced by his hypoxemic respiratory failure and subsequent treatment with hydralazine and nitroprusside.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to bone marrow suppression caused by critical illness and renal failure. Efforts should be made to minimize phlebotomy and initiate erythropoietin therapy.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD and elevated cardiac enzymes indicate ongoing myocardial ischemia. Further evaluation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, likely secondary to H1N1 influenza. He has a complicated course including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by PsA and Stenotrophomonas, as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient developed acute pulmonary edema and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during a tracheostomy trial. His current condition includes acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying cardiac condition, possibly including coronary artery disease (CAD) and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), may be contributing to the chronic respiratory failure. Management includes hemodialysis (HD) to minimize fluid overload, controlling blood pressure, and managing cardiac status with medications such as isordil/hydralazine, ASA, statin, and titrated metoprolol.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has VAP caused by PsA and Stenotrophomonas. Complete meropenem therapy is being initiated, and awaiting sensitivities for Stenotrophomonas. Ceftazidime is currently being used, with consideration for bactrim desensitization.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and has been treated with various antibiotics for different infections. He is currently being treated for stenotrophomonas infection with ceftazidime. The patient also has small bowel obstruction, constipation, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stenotrophomonas infection: The patient is currently being treated for stenotrophomonas infection with ceftazidime. If the infection does not respond to this antibiotic, alternative treatment options may need to be considered.
2. Allergic reaction: The patient has a known allergy to sulfa medications. It is important to avoid the use of sulfa-containing drugs to prevent an allergic reaction.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a small bowel obstruction, which can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and vomiting. Surgical intervention may be necessary if conservative measures fail to relieve the obstruction.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation needs to be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ARDS, complicated ICU course including VAP (PsA and stenotrophomonas), VRE bacteremia, renal failure. The patient has a sulfa allergy and has received multiple antibiotics. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 149/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 188 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.59, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 326, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 14 L/min. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.4 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 22.3%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 296 K/uL, increased creatinine (Cr) of 4.5 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T of 0.12 ng/mL, and elevated lactic acid level of 1.5 mmol/L. The patient's physical examination reveals clear chest sounds, irregular heart rhythm (AF), no abdominal tenderness, and wrapped lower legs with minimal edema. The patient's mental status is slowly clearing, and he is responsive to voice. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of chronic respiratory failure due to underlying cardiac etiology with congestive heart failure (CHF).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP caused by PsA and stenotrophomonas.

   67yoM with resolving ARDS, course complicated by VAP, VRE bacteremia,
   acute renal failure.
   1.  Chronic respiratory failure:  Suspect cardiac etiology with CHF
   with acute change yesterday.
   - Try to minimize fluids
   - Management of cardiac/volume status as below
   - Trial of trach mask for 2-4 hours
   2.  CV: underlying CAD/likely diastolic CHF
   - Will add hydralazine for afterload reduction (avoiding ace-inhibitor
   in setting of recent kidney injury and hope for recovery)
   - ASA, statin; titrate metoprolol as needed
   - Transfuse PRBC x 2 units
   3.  VAP:  PsA, stenotrophomonas; s/p meropenem
   - Await sensitivities on stenotrophomonas; currently on ceftazadime.
   Consider bactrim desensitization.
   4.  VRE:  Cultures negative, TTE/TEE negative; completed daptomycin
   5.  Yeast: urine, sputum
   - fluconazole D#[**3-9**] today.
   6.  Neuro:  slowly clearing mental status and rigidtity
   - no haldol, benzos; morphine as needed for pain
   7.  Renal:
   - will need tunneled line; await him being afebrile
   - discuss with renal regarding HD for 2-3 days to assist with volume
   management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, complicated by VAP (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas) and VRE bacteremia. He also has renal failure. The patient has a history of sulfa allergy. He has received several antibiotics including meropenem, daptomycin, and ceftazidime. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His oxygen saturation is 100% and his respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and impaired renal function. There are also signs of infection with yeast in the urine and sputum. The patient's mental status is improving, but he still exhibits rigidity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying cardiac condition, likely diastolic CHF, may lead to chronic respiratory failure.
2. VAP: The patient has developed VAP caused by PsA and stenotrophomonas. It is crucial to manage this infection appropriately.
3. VRE bacteremia: Although the patient's VRE bacteremia has cleared, close monitoring is necessary to prevent recurrence.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, requiring careful management and consideration for dialysis.
5. Yeast infection: The presence of yeast in the urine and sputum indicates a potential fungal infection, which needs to be treated promptly.
6. Neurological issues: The patient's mental status is improving, but he still exhibits rigidity. Monitoring his neurological status is essential.
7. Cardiac status: The patient's underlying CAD and potential CHF need to be managed appropriately to optimize cardiac function.
8. Fluid management: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and potential CHF, careful fluid management is necessary to avoid exacerbating his condition.
9. Antibiotic sensitivity: The patient's sputum culture indicates the presence of stenotrophomonas. Waiting for sensitivity results is crucial to guide antibiotic therapy.
10. Sulfa allergy: The patient's history of sulfa allergy should be taken into consideration when selecting future medications."

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: Febrile again yesterday but WBC remains stable. Likely
   stenotrophamonas which is not responding to standard antibiotics.
   Patient tolerated bactrim test dose. ID was curbsided and felt that
   betalactams and fluoroquinolones would be less efficacious. WBC
   improving
   - Start bactrim 2.5 tabs DS for 7 days to cover Stenotrohpomonas
   - LP today  to ruled out central source of fevers
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: finished dapto for VRE course [**12-26**], finished [**Last Name (un) 614**] for
   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole started12/21 for planned 5 day course to cover yeast
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Worsening oxygenation in the setting
   of fluid accumulation after 2 units of blood yesterday and minimal
   uop.. Likely had flash pulmonary edema vs. mucous plug.
   - HD today
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - hold off on TM until dialysis can remove fluid today
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Rigidity: Improving, likely resolving drug effect/serotonin syndrome,
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   Received 2 U PRBC yesterday. Hct improved only 4%. .
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue EPO with HD
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line when afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome
   - Holding buproprion and prozac

   4) Afib - on coumadin
   5) CAD
   6) Anemia
   Plan:
   1) Recognizing a distant allergy with Bactrim (reportedly mild rash)
   and in discussion with ID, will go ahead and start Bactrim because no
   other good options for stenotrophomonas
   2) Will perform LP
   3) Dialysis - will likely need serial dialysis for next couple days
   4) Wean to trach shield as tolerated
 dialysis should help

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He has been febrile multiple times, with a recent episode of rigidity and hyperreflexia that improved after stopping Prozac and buproprion. The patient has anemia, hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, severe sepsis, and several comorbidities. The patient's condition remains critical, and he requires ongoing treatment and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/Pneumonia - Stenotrophomonas infection: The patient has a persistent fever despite previous antibiotic treatment. Stenotrophomonas is resistant to some antibiotics, and Bactrim has been started to cover this organism. It is important to monitor the patient's response to this antibiotic and perform appropriate cultures to guide further treatment.
2. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function continues to deteriorate, indicating worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring and aggressive supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has significantly impaired"

   stenotrophamonas which is not responding to standard antibiotics.
   Patient tolerated bactrim test dose. ID was curbsided and felt that
   betalactams and fluoroquinolones would be less efficacious. WBC
   improving
   - Start bactrim 2.5 tabs DS for 7 days to cover Stenotrohpomonas
   - LP today  to ruled out central source of fevers
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: finished dapto for VRE course [**12-26**], finished [**Last Name (un) 614**] for
   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole started12/21 for planned 5 day course to cover yeast
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Worsening oxygenation in the setting
   of fluid accumulation after 2 units of blood yesterday and minimal
   uop.. Likely had flash pulmonary edema vs. mucous plug.
   - HD today
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - hold off on TM until dialysis can remove fluid today
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Rigidity: Improving, likely resolving drug effect/serotonin syndrome,

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently febrile, experiencing rigidity, and has hyperreflexia. The patient's white blood cell count is improving after starting antibiotics to cover Stenotrophomonas. A lumbar puncture has been ordered to rule out a central source of fevers. The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is worsening due to fluid accumulation, and he will undergo hemodialysis today. The rigidity is likely resolving due to drug effect or serotonin syndrome. The patient's coronary artery disease enzymes are at baseline, and he is on aspirin and statin therapy. Anemia is suspected to be caused by bone marrow suppression from critical illness or renal failure, and the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells yesterday. Acute renal failure does not appear to be recovering, and the patient will continue with hemodialysis. The patient is currently in atrial flutter and is being rate-controlled. There are concerns about serotonin syndrome related to depression medication. The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and has prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU for now."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia.

The patient has an allergic reaction to sulfa, so alternative antibiotics need to be considered. Stenotrophomonas infection is suspected, and sensitivity testing will be done to determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment. If the patient does not improve, a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast from sinus to abdomen may be performed to identify other potential sources of infection.

The patient's rigidity is likely due to a drug effect or serotonin syndrome. Medications such as Prozac and bupropion have been stopped, and metoprolol is being continued to control blood pressure. The use of haloperidol has been withheld due to concerns of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and parkinsonian symptoms. A neurological evaluation is recommended.

Hypoxemic respiratory failure may have been caused by flash pulmonary edema or a mucous plug. Hemodialysis (HD) will be used to remove excess fluid, and medications like nitro and hydralazine will be considered for blood"

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: Febrile again yesterday but WBC remains stable. No clear
   etiology. CSF benign appearing. Possibly related to stenotrophamonas
   which is not responding to standard antibiotics. Patient tolerated
   bactrim test dose. ID was curbsided and felt that betalactams and
   fluoroquinolones would be less efficacious. WBC improving
   - Continue  bactrim 2.5 tabs DS day [**3-11**] fpr Stenotrohpomonas
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: finished dapto for VRE course [**12-26**], finished [**Last Name (un) 614**] for
   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole started12/21 for planned 5 day course to cover yeast
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Respiratory status improved after HD
   removal of 4 Kg yesterday.
   - HD tomorrow
   - Attempt TM today
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Afib: Tachy brady noted yesterday from 40s to 120s after missing one
   dose. Rate controlled again this morning. Currenlty holding digoxin.
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Reduce metoprolol to 50 mg Q8 in case first degree AV block is
   precipitating tachycardia
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   Received 2 U PRBC 2 days ago. Hct improved only 4%. .
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue EPO with HD
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line when afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome but never had elevated CK. Rigidity
   improved. Prozac and bupropion have been on hold.
   - Holding buproprion and prozac
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has been febrile with rigidity and hyperreflexia. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status improved after removing 4 kg of fluid yesterday. However, he still requires mechanical ventilation and there is a concern for further respiratory deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile with rigidity and hyperreflexia, suggesting possible sepsis. The causative organism is not yet identified, and the patient is being treated with bactrim for Stenotrophomonas.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an increase in urine output followed by a decrease. He is currently on hemodialysis and will need continued renal support.
4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium/confusion, which may be due to multiple factors such as sepsis, medications, or underlying conditions.
5. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is presenting with EKG changes"

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: Febrile again yesterday but WBC remains stable. Likely
   stenotrophamonas which is not responding to standard antibiotics.
   Patient tolerated bactrim test dose. ID was curbsided and felt that
   betalactams and fluoroquinolones would be less efficacious. WBC
   improving
   - Start bactrim 2.5 tabs DS for 7 days to cover Stenotrohpomonas
   - LP today  to ruled out central source of fevers
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: finished dapto for VRE course [**12-26**], finished [**Last Name (un) 614**] for
   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole started12/21 for planned 5 day course to cover yeast
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Worsening oxygenation in the setting
   of fluid accumulation after 2 units of blood yesterday and minimal
   uop.. Likely had flash pulmonary edema vs. mucous plug.
   - HD today
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - hold off on TM until dialysis can remove fluid today
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Rigidity: Improving, likely resolving drug effect/serotonin syndrome,
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   Received 2 U PRBC yesterday. Hct improved only 4%. .
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue EPO with HD
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line when afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome
   - Holding buproprion and prozac

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure.
- The patient has been febrile and exhibited rigidity and hyperreflexia.
- Blood cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started to cover Stenotrophomonas.
- The patient's oxygenation has worsened, and fluid accumulation is present, indicating possible flash pulmonary edema or mucous plug.
- Hydralazine has been initiated for afterload reduction, and hemodialysis (HD) will be performed today to remove excess fluid.
- The patient's anemia is likely due to bone marrow suppression from critical illness or renal failure. Two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) were given yesterday, but the hematocrit (Hct) improved only 4%.
- The patient's acute renal failure does not appear to be reversible, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) will be continued with plans for a tunnelled line when the patient is afebrile.
- The patient's atrial flutter is currently being rate-controlled, and consideration is being given to restarting digoxin if more flutter occurs.
- The patient's depression may be related to serotonin syndrome, and buproprion and prozac have been held.

   # Fevers: Febrile again yesterday but WBC remains stable. Likely
   stenotrophamonas which is not responding to standard antibiotics.
   Patient tolerated bactrim test dose. ID was curbsided and felt that
   betalactams and fluoroquinolones would be less efficacious. WBC
   improving
   - Start bactrim 2.5 tabs DS for 7 days to cover Stenotrohpomonas
   - LP today  to ruled out central source of fevers
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: finished dapto for VRE course [**12-26**], finished [**Last Name (un) 614**] for
   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole started12/21 for planned 5 day course to cover yeast
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Worsening oxygenation in the setting
   of fluid accumulation after 2 units of blood yesterday and minimal
   uop.. Likely had flash pulmonary edema vs. mucous plug.
   - HD today
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - hold off on TM until dialysis can remove fluid today
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Rigidity: Improving, likely resolving drug effect/serotonin syndrome,
   - Stopped Prozac and buproprion
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro
   recs
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   Received 2 U PRBC yesterday. Hct improved only 4%. .
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue EPO with HD
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line when afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Afib: Currently in rate controlled flutter, holding digoxin. Consider
   restarting if more flutter
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome
   - Holding buproprion and prozac

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is little
   overall
   change. Status post CABG, the tracheostomy tube and the double-lumen
   left-sided central venous access line are in unchanged position.
   Unchanged
   bilateral reticular nodular opacities of constant extent and severity.
   Moderate cardiomegaly, no signs of overt overhydration. No pulmonary
   opacities have newly occurred in the interval.
   Assessment and Plan
   67yoM with resolving ARDS, course complicated by VAP, VRE bacteremia,
   acute renal failure.
   1.  Chronic respiratory failure:  Suspect cardiac etiology with CHF
   with acute change yesterday.
   - Try to minimize fluids
   - Management of cardiac/volume status as below
   - Trial of trach mask for 2-4 hours
   2.  CV: underlying CAD/likely diastolic CHF
   - Will add hydralazine for afterload reduction (avoiding ace-inhibitor
   in setting of recent kidney injury and hope for recovery)
   - ASA, statin; titrate metoprolol as needed
   - Transfuse PRBC x 2 units
   3.  VAP:  PsA, stenotrophomonas; s/p meropenem
   - Await sensitivities on stenotrophomonas; currently on ceftazadime.
   Consider bactrim desensitization.
   4.  VRE:  Cultures negative, TTE/TEE negative; completed daptomycin
   5.  Yeast: urine, sputum
   - fluconazole D#[**3-9**] today.
   6.  Neuro:  slowly clearing mental status and rigidtity
   - no haldol, benzos; morphine as needed for pain
   7.  Renal:
   - will need tunneled line; await him being afebrile
   - discuss with renal regarding HD for 2-3 days to assist with volume
   management.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ARDS, complicated ICU course including VAP (PsA and stenotrophomonas), VRE bacteremia, and renal failure. He has been intubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tracheostomy tube. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/67 to 147/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals rales at the bases of the chest, regular heart rhythm without murmurs or gallops, soft abdomen with rounding up with breathing, warm extremities without edema, and neurologic examination showing tracks, answers some questions, and squeezes left hand to command.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and slightly elevated troponin T. The chest X-ray shows no significant changes from the previous radiograph.

The patient's assessment and plan include chronic respiratory failure, underlying cardiovascular disease with likely diastolic heart failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by PsA and stenotrophomonas, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, yeast infection in urine and sputum, low-grade fevers, and acute renal"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ARDS, complicated ICU course including VAP (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas), VRE bacteremia, and renal failure. The patient is currently sedated and encephalopathic, unable to provide history. Allergies include sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) with rash. The last dose of antibiotics was Daptomycin on 12/26/2102 at 01:59 PM, and Ceftazidime on 12/26/2102 at 02:35 PM. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 108 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 122/67 to 147/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,413 mL and total output of 4,180 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,767 mL. 

The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube, using CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 26 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.4 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 129 mg/dL, renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T level of 0.14, and elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has multiple medical complications including chronic anemia, hypernatremia, fever, delirium/confusion, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. 

ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren 2.0, glycemic control, and various lines such as dialysis catheter and PICC line. Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   - Try to minimize fluids
   - Management of cardiac/volume status as below
   - Trial of trach mask for 2-4 hours
   2.  CV: underlying CAD/likely diastolic CHF
   - Will add hydralazine for afterload reduction (avoiding ace-inhibitor
   in setting of recent kidney injury and hope for recovery)
   - ASA, statin; titrate metoprolol as needed
   - Transfuse PRBC x 2 units
   3.  VAP:  PsA, stenotrophomonas; s/p meropenem
   - Await sensitivities on stenotrophomonas; currently on ceftazadime.
   Consider bactrim desensitization.
   4.  VRE:  Cultures negative, TTE/TEE negative; completed daptomycin
   5.  Yeast: urine, sputum
   - fluconazole D#[**3-9**] today.
   6.  Neuro:  slowly clearing mental status and rigidtity
   - no haldol, benzos; morphine as needed for pain
   7.  Renal:
   - will need tunneled line; await him being afebrile
   - discuss with renal regarding HD for 2-3 days to assist with volume
   management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of ARDS and has experienced complications in the ICU, including VAP (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas), VRE bacteremia, and renal failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide his own history. His allergies include sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), and he has had recent infusions of Heparin Sodium. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure with suspected cardiac etiology, possibly due to congestive heart failure (CHF) with acute changes.
2. Underlying cardiovascular disease, likely diastolic CHF.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by PsA and stenotrophomonas.
4. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, currently negative cultures.
5. Acute renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ARDS, ARF, and sepsis. He has had a complicated ICU course, including VAP (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas), VRE bacteremia, and renal failure. The patient tolerated tracheostomy (TM) all day yesterday and has low-grade temperatures. His beta-blocker dose was decreased without recurrent bradycardia. He is getting hemodialysis (HD) this morning. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, underlying coronary artery disease (CAD)/likely diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), VAP, VRE bacteremia, and acute renal failure. He is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen if there are any complications related to the tracheostomy or if the underlying cause of ARDS progresses.
2. Underlying CAD/diastolic CHF: The patient's underlying CAD/diastolic CHF may lead to further cardiac complications if not properly managed.
3. VAP: The patient's VAP caused by PsA and stenotrophomonas may recur or progress if appropriate measures are not taken to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. VRE bacteremia: The patient's VRE bacteremia may recur or lead to systemic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of ARDS, ARF, and sepsis. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, hypernatremia, fever, delirium/confusion, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, and myocardial infarction. The patient also has acute respiratory failure, renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These may include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient already has acute respiratory failure, and if not properly managed, it could progress and lead to further deterioration in lung function.

2. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient is currently experiencing acute renal failure. Without appropriate treatment and management, this condition may worsen, leading to a decline in kidney function.

3. Sepsis progression: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. If not effectively treated, sepsis can progress and cause multiple organ failure.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction. There is a risk of developing further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical conditions including anemia, hypernatremia, delirium/confusion, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status improved after hemodialysis (HD) removal of 1.5 kg yesterday. He continues to require mechanical ventilation and will be monitored closely for any changes in his respiratory function.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's fevers and rigidity suggest an ongoing infection. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, a type of bacteria, has been identified as a possible cause and is being treated with bactrim. Cultures from various sites will be followed to determine the effectiveness of the antibiotic treatment.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure does not appear to be resolving, and he will continue with hemodialysis. A tunnelled line will be considered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and is experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including anemia, hypernatremia, delirium, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, renal failure, and depression. He is being treated with multiple medications and interventions, including antibiotics for suspected stenotrophamonas infection, dialysis, and respiratory support. The patient's prognosis is uncertain due to the severity of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress to respiratory arrest if adequate oxygenation is not maintained.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration and neurological symptoms if not managed properly.

2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has been showing signs of confusion and delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or metabolic imbalances.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has stage II decubitus ulcers, indicating pressure sores that require regular wound care to prevent further complications.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support, suggesting respiratory failure. There are plans to trial extubation and downsize the tracheostomy tube if tolerated.

6. Renal Failure: The patient shows signs of acute renal failure, with elevated creatinine levels. There are plans for hemodialysis when fevers resolve.

7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial flutter, which requires continued IV heparin and titration of metoprolol.

8. Serotonin Syndrome: The patient's symptoms are consistent with serotonin syndrome, and further evaluation is needed.

9. Stenotrophomonas Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by stenotrophomonas bacteria"

   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers:. No clear etiology. CSF benign appearing. TSH normal.
   Cortisol elevated, making hypoadrenalism unlikely.  Possibly related to
   stenotrophamonas which is now responding to Bactrim. Patient tolerated
   bactrim test dose. ID was curbsided and felt that betalactams and
   fluoroquinolones would be less efficacious. WBC improving. Could still
   be resolving serotonin syndrome.
   - Continue  bactrim 2.5 tabs DS day [**5-19**] fpr Stenotrohpomonas
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: finished dapto for VRE course [**12-26**], finished [**Last Name (un) 614**] for
   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole completed [**12-25**] to [**12-30**] for urine yeast
   - Check ESR/CRP, if markedly elevated consider back MRI for osteo given
   some back pain
   - Check TSH and AM cortisol
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Tolerating trach mask well.
   - HD line today and HD to follow after that
   - TM as tolerated
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Afib: HR well controlled on reduced metoprolol dose. Currenlty
   holding digoxin.
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Reduced metoprolol to 50 mg Q8 in case first degree AV block is
   precipitating tachycardia
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   Received 2 U PRBC 2 days ago. Hct improved only 4%. .
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue EPO with HD
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line when afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome but never had elevated CK. Rigidity
   improved. Prozac and bupropion have been on hold.
   - Holding buproprion and prozac
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient's current conditions include anemia, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, delirium/confusion, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

The patient's medical history and current symptoms suggest potential complications such as:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) indicates a possible severe sepsis or septic shock. It is important to continue monitoring vital signs, organ function, and culture results to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure. The need for dialysis has been initiated, and further management should involve monitoring electrolyte levels, fluid balance, and adjusting medication dosages accordingly.

3. Atrial flutter: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current presentation of atrial flutter require close monitoring of heart rhythm and rate control. Medications such as beta-block"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 151/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's medical history includes chronic anemia, hypernatremia, fever, delirium, atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen due to the increasing sputum production and potential infection indicated by the elevated white blood cell count and fever.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction could lead to further deterioration of organ function, including the kidneys and lungs.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine levels and acute renal failure indicate a potential risk of acute kidney injury, which can be exacerbated by the patient's sepsis and fluid imbalances."

   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole started12/21 to [**12-30**]
   -Recheck pan cultures today
   - Check ESR/CRP, if markedly elevated consider back MRI for osteo given
   some back pain
   - Check TSH and AM cortisol
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Respiratory status improved after HD
   removal of 1.5 Kg yesterday.
   - HD tomorrow
   - TM as tolerated
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Afib: Tachy brady noted yesterday from 40s to 120s after missing one
   dose. Rate controlled again this morning. Currenlty holding digoxin.

   - Reduced metoprolol to 50 mg Q8 in case first degree AV block is
   precipitating tachycardia
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   Received 2 U PRBC 2 days ago. Hct improved only 4%. .
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue EPO with HD
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line when afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome but never had elevated CK. Rigidity
   improved. Prozac and bupropion have been on hold.
   - Holding buproprion and prozac

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may be due to bone marrow suppression caused by critical illness or renal failure.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be a result of dehydration or excessive intake.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which could be attributed to multiple factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or metabolic imbalances.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, a type of abnormal heart rhythm, which may require rate control measures.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to immobility or pressure ulcers.
6. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient may have an alteration in nutrition, potentially leading to malnutrition or poor nutritional status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was initially admitted after H1N1 with respiratory failure. The patient has been on invasive ventilation, blood cultures, and sputum cultures. He presented with bloody sputum while on heparin drip, which improved after stopping heparin. The patient has been on total parenteral nutrition (TCM) for the past several days. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 158/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on tracheal mask. His weight is 85.3 kg, and height is 67 inches. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,319 mL and a total output of 595 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a tracheal mask, with an ABG result of ///27. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and right and left lower extremity edema at 1+. 

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) at 7.7 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) at 15.4 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) at 272, creatinine (Cr) at 3.8 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.12, TCO2 at 32, glucose at 111 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range. 

The patient has several medical complications including chronic anemia, hypernatremia (high sodium), delirium/confusion, atrial flutter, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, severe sepsis (resolved), and possible serotonin syndrome. 

The patient's care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, lines (PICC line and tunneled dialysis catheter), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and other measures. The patient is currently in the ICU for pulmonary toilet and hemodynamic monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers: No clear etiology. CSF benign appearing. TSH normal. Cortisol
   elevated, making hypoadrenalism unlikely.  Possibly related to
   stenotrophamonas which is now responding to Bactrim. Patient tolerated
   bactrim test dose. ID was curbsided and felt that beta lactams and
   fluoroquinolones would be less efficacious. WBC improving. Could still
   be resolving serotonin syndrome.
   - Continue  bactrim 2.5 tabs DS day [**6-19**] for Stenotrohpomonas
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: finished dapto for VRE course [**12-26**], finished [**Last Name (un) 614**] for
   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole completed [**12-25**] to [**12-30**] for urine yeast
   - consider back MRI for osteo given some back pain
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Tolerating trach mask well.
   - trach mask as tolerated
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Afib: HR well controlled on reduced metoprolol dose. Currenlty
   holding digoxin.
   - continue coumadin
   - stop heparin gtt as will pull PICC
   - Reduced metoprolol to 50 mg Q8 in case first degree AV block is
   precipitating tachycardia
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   Received 2 U PRBC 2 days ago. Hct improved only 4%. .
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue EPO with HD
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunneled line when afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome but never had elevated CK. Rigidity
   improved. Prozac and bupropion have been on hold.
   - Holding buproprion and prozac
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro recs

         PLEASE SUBMIT ANOTHER SPECIMEN.
   CSF [**2102-12-28**]: No polys, no organisms
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with history of dCHF, COPD, Afib, CAD s/p CABG presents with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock and ARF now  w/ fevers,
   rigidity, hyperreflexia.
   # Fevers:. No clear etiology. CSF benign appearing. TSH normal.
   Cortisol elevated, making hypoadrenalism unlikely.  Possibly related to
   stenotrophamonas which is now responding to Bactrim. Patient tolerated
   bactrim test dose. ID was curbsided and felt that betalactams and
   fluoroquinolones would be less efficacious. WBC improving. Could still
   be resolving serotonin syndrome.
   - Continue  bactrim 2.5 tabs DS day [**5-19**] fpr Stenotrohpomonas
   - follow sputum culture, blood, urine, HD line cultures
   - Antibiotics: finished dapto for VRE course [**12-26**], finished [**Last Name (un) 614**] for
   VAP [**12-26**]
   - fluconazole completed [**12-25**] to [**12-30**] for urine yeast
   - Check ESR/CRP, if markedly elevated consider back MRI for osteo given
   some back pain
   - Check TSH and AM cortisol
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Tolerating trach mask well.
   - HD line today and HD to follow after that
   - TM as tolerated
   - Hydral for afterload reduction
   - treat stenotrophamonas as above
   - continue excellent pulmonary toilet
   # Afib: HR well controlled on reduced metoprolol dose. Currenlty
   holding digoxin.
   - heparin gtt; holding coumadin for tunnelled line
   - Reduced metoprolol to 50 mg Q8 in case first degree AV block is
   precipitating tachycardia
   - Amiodarone and metoprolol
   # Coronary artery disease:  enzymes baseline after flash.
   - ASA, statin
   - cath once out of ICU to define anatomy
   # Anemia: BM suppresion likely [**2-6**] critical illness/ renal failure.
   Received 2 U PRBC 2 days ago. Hct improved only 4%. .
   - Try to minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue EPO with HD
   # Acute renal failure: UOP increased for one day but then dropped off,
   does not appear that he will regain renal function
   - continue HD, plan for tunnelled line when afebrile
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Depression: ? serotonin syndrome but never had elevated CK. Rigidity
   improved. Prozac and bupropion have been on hold.
   - Holding buproprion and prozac
   - continue metoprolol, BP well controlled
   - hold Haldol for concern of NMS and parkisonian symptoms
   - Appreciate neuro recs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently experiencing fevers, rigidity, and hyperreflexia. The patient has been treated with various medications including bactrim for Stenotrophomonas infection, antibiotics for VRE and VAP, fluconazole for urine yeast, and heparin for atrial fibrillation. His vital signs are stable, but he requires ongoing respiratory support with a tracheal mask. The patient's blood cultures show yeast in the urine, while the CSF is benign appearing. There are no clear etiologies for his fevers. The patient's WBC count is improving, and there is a possibility of resolving serotonin syndrome. The plan is to continue bactrim for Stenotrophomonas, follow sputum, blood, and urine cultures, and check ESR/CRP. The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is being managed with HD line and HD treatment. His atrial fibrillation is well controlled on reduced metoprolol dose, and digoxin is being held. The patient's coronary artery disease is being managed with ASA and statin, and a catheterization will be done"
