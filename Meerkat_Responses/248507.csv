","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hip pain following left total hip arthroplasty (THA). Overnight events include transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and bolusing of 500cc of lactated Ringer's solution, resulting in a decrease in heart rate from 100 to the 70s. The patient has several known allergies, including losartan causing angioedema and lip swelling, lisinopril causing cough, penicillins causing itching, and tramadol causing rash. The last dose of antibiotics was given.

The patient is currently on multiple infusions and medications, including ICU-specific medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

Vital signs and flow sheet data are provided, showing a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate in the 70s, blood pressure ranging from 94/52 to 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight fluid balance deficit.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with oxygen saturation maintained at 97%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is pending. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to non-assessment of pulses and skin."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, CHF, and atrial fibrillation. She underwent left total hip arthroplasty (L THA) and is currently admitted to the ICU for post-operative care. The patient presented with an episode of tachycardia, which improved overnight with the transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fluid bolus. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 70s and blood pressure within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic function, or pain. Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient is receiving various medications including metoprolol, warfarin, albuterol, tiopropium, advair, prednisone, lasix, atorvastatin, morphine PCA, lovenox, and famotidine. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU for potential complications related to her medical conditions and recent surgery. Potential medical complications that can arise include further episodes of tachycardia, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, and glycemic"

   Borderline BP through day with declining UO. C/O thirst but no SOB.
   Exam remains notable for [**3-24**] holosyst m but no crackles.
   Although hct is stable she appears hypovolemic. We are giving IVF with
   close observation of resp status.  BP is low at baseline but this is
   lower than she usually goes.  Will watch closely for next 12 hrs

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation who presented with an episode of tachycardia after undergoing left total hip arthroplasty (L THA). The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and a fluid bolus, which helped improve her condition overnight. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate ranging from 73-111 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 94/52-126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin concentration of 10.6 g/dL, blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.02 mg/dL. The patient's INR is 12.6, and her cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) are within normal range. Other lab values, including electrolytes, are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of tachycardia with metoprolol, initiation of warfarin therapy due to her history of atrial fibrillation, monitoring of cardiac enzymes, and treatment for anemia with additional PRBC transfusion if necessary. The patient's other medical conditions, such as COPD, CHF, and recent left THA, are also being addressed with appropriate medications and precautions.

The patient's current critical care needs involve close monitoring of blood pressure, fluid status, and respiratory status. The patient appears hypovolemic despite a stable hematocrit level, and IV fluids are being administered with caution due to the patient's borderline blood pressure and risk of fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at baseline, and further drops in blood pressure may indicate hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient underwent surgery and is immobilized, there is a risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's history of COPD and recent surgery increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level indicates potential renal dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by medications or fluid overload.
6. Bleeding: With the initiation of warfarin therapy, there is a risk of bleeding, especially in the context of recent surgery.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values to promptly identify and manage these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD and CHF who underwent left total hip arthroplasty (THA) on 04/26/2142. She presented with an episode of tachycardia, which was later converted to normal sinus rhythm. The patient also experienced hypotension, for which she received a blood transfusion and fluid bolus. She has a history of allergies to Losartan, Lisinopril, Penicillins, and Ultram. The patient is currently on several medications including Enoxaparin (Lovenox), Famotidine (Pepcid), and others. Her vital signs show a temperature of 100.8°F, heart rate ranging from 73-94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 62-72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated cardiac enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been ranging from 70/40s-110s/60s. She is completely asymptomatic with low blood pressure and is maintaining good urine output. Possible causes include bleeding into the left hip post-op, medication-related (Lasix, beta-blockers, narcotics),"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F with h/o COPD, CHF now s/p L THA ([**2142-4-26**]), presents with an
   episode of tachycardia (junctional rhythm), asymptomatic, improved
   overnight with PRBC, fluid bolus.
   # Hypotension: Patient BP has been ranging from 70/40s-110s/60s. She is
   completely asymptomatic with low BP
s and is maintaining good UOP.
   Possibilities include bleeding in to L hip post-op, medication related
   (lasix, BB and narcotics) or falsely low BP due to atherosclerosis.
   - pm Hct to eval for bleed
   - will hold BB, lasix and minimize narcotics
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Patient has several episodes of possible SVT (likely
   AVNRT)up to 130
s bpm on tele o/n but converted to NSR at 90
s bpm
   without intervention. INR currently 1.4 from 1.1 yesterday.
   - holding BB due to hypotension
   - will monitor tele and try to obtain EKG if in SVT
   .
   #. Anemia:  Patient with Hct drop post-op to 26. Given 1u PRBC-> Hct
   31.6 and has trended down to 28.7 this am. She as a JP drain in place
   and was noted to have some oozing at surgical site. Patient is
   currently being anticoagualted (LMWH bridge to coumadin) which could
   complicate bleeding from or at surgical site.
   - repeat pm Hct as patient started on coumadin

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who underwent left total hip arthroplasty (THA). The patient has been experiencing several medical complications since admission to the ICU.

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating between 70/40s-110s/60s. This could be due to bleeding into the hip post-operatively, medication-related side effects (such as Lasix, beta-blockers, and narcotics), or falsely low blood pressure due to atherosclerosis.

2. Tachycardia: The patient had several episodes of possible supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), likely atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), with heart rates up to 130 beats per minute. The patient's INR increased from 1.1 to 1.4 overnight.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped post-operatively to 26%. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which temporarily increased the Hct to 31.6 but has since decreased to 28.7. The patient has a joint drainage in place and noted oozing at the surgical site. The patient is currently being anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin (LM"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been monitored for various parameters. The patient has arterial lines placed and received multiple medications including Enoxaparin (Lovenox), Famotidine (Pepcid), and others. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits with a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/44 to 119/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5,062 mL and total output of 725 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,337 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 92%. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic examination, and other systems are not assessed in the note.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 31.6%, platelet count (Plt) at 194 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.02 ng/mL, blood glucose at 126 mg/dL, and elevated levels of PT, PTT, and INR. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal ranges.

The patient has been monitored for various parameters, including hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient's arterial lines were started and stopped on specific dates, and the patient received prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and temperature suggest the possibility of an infection. Further investigation and appropriate cultures may be needed to confirm.
2. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance indicates the possibility of fluid overload. Monitoring and adjusting the fluid intake and output may be necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions may be required.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient's oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula suggests potential respiratory problems. Continuous monitoring and adjustments in respiratory support may be necessary.
5. Renal dysfunction: Elevated levels of creatinine and BUN may indicate renal dysfunction. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medications accordingly may be required.

These are just some potential complications based on the information provided."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation. She underwent left total hip arthroplasty (L THA) on [**2142-4-26**]. The patient presented with an episode of tachycardia, which improved overnight with packed red blood cells (PRBC) and fluid bolus. Her blood pressure remains stable, and she continues to be on metoprolol 12.5 mg PO bid. Warfarin therapy has been initiated at a dose of 4 mg PO daily due to her history of atrial fibrillation. Cardiac enzymes are being monitored. The patient is also being treated for anemia, COPD/eosinophilic lung disease, CHF/CAD, and post-operative pain control. She is on prophylactic lovenox for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and vancomycin will be administered tomorrow. The patient is also receiving wound bed care, glycemic control, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia, which can be caused by various factors such as pain, infection, electrolyte imbalance, or cardiac arrhythmia. Monitoring heart rate and rhythm is crucial to detect any further episodes or progression.
2. Anemia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, CHF, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with an episode of tachycardia, which improved overnight. The patient had a left total hip arthroplasty (THA) on 04/26 and is now experiencing episodes of possible supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), likely atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Her hemoglobin (Hct) level dropped post-op but has been corrected with packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient is currently being anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and will be bridged to warfarin. She has a drain in place and is at risk for bleeding complications. The patient's other medical conditions include COPD/eosinophilic lung disease, CHF/CAD, and s/p L THA. She is receiving appropriate medications for pain control, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's glycemic control and nutritional needs are being monitored. She is on prophylactic antibiotics and has an updated code status of full code. The patient is to be transferred to the floor.

   81 yo female with history of COPD/CHF now with left total hip
   replacement [**4-26**] and admitted with junctional tachycardia and
   hypotension from PACU
   Hypotension-_This was seen in the immediate post operative state and
   has persistent through to this morning.  This may be multifactorial and
   related to medications with beta-blockers in place and narcotics for
   pain control.  Alternatively acute insults such as blood loss, cardiac
   dysfnction, obstructive sources of impaired cardiac function all are
   important to consider.
   -Will follow HCT and wound site appears reassuring
   -No evidence for sepsis
   -Will monitor for respiratory distress or any evidence of significant
   hypoxia to consider possible source of PE
   -Will evaluate patient cardiac history or evaluate with ECHO
   -Vasodilatory source may be considered with possible effects of
   narcotic medications

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and CHF who underwent a total hip replacement surgery on 4-26. She is currently in the ICU due to junctional tachycardia and hypotension post-operatively. The arterial line was started on 4-27 at 09:11 AM and stopped at 07:00 PM. The patient experienced intermittent tachycardia and hypotension overnight, requiring IV fluid bolus. She also had a fever of 100.8°F (38.2°C) and her heart rate has been fluctuating between 73-94 bpm. Blood cultures were drawn on 4-27 at 03:35 AM and 12:41 PM, as well as on 4-28 at 06:11 AM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension post-operatively, which may be multifactorial. Possible causes include medications (such as beta-blockers), blood loss, cardiac dysfunction, or obstructive sources of impaired cardiac function.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has intermittent tachycardia, which could be related to pain, fever, medication side effects, or underlying cardiac issues.
3. Infection: Although there is no evidence of sepsis, the patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count warrant monitoring for potential infections, such as wound infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who underwent left total hip arthroplasty (THA) on [2142-4-26]. She presents with an episode of tachycardia and hypotension, but is currently asymptomatic. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped to 25.8 and received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She has a history of allergies to losartan, angioedema/lip, lisinopril (oral), cough, penicillins, itching, and tramadol Hcl (rash). The patient is currently being anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging to coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension with a blood pressure reading in the 60s. This could be due to various factors such as bleeding, medication side effects, or underlying heart condition.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped to 25.8, indicating a potential anemia. This may be related to blood loss during surgery or ongoing bleeding.
3. Tachycardia: The patient had an episode of tachycardia, but it resolved. The underlying cause needs to be investigated further"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD and CHF who underwent left total hip arthroplasty (THA) on 04/26/2142. She presented with tachycardia and hypotension post-op but is currently asymptomatic with good urine output. Her hemoglobin (Hct) dropped from 31.6 to 25.9 after receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient has a JP drain in place with some oozing at the surgical site and is being anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging to coumadin. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 70/40s to 110s/60s, temperature at 37.8°C, heart rate between 60-95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 10-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted hypotension and tachycardia. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and well-perfused extremities. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Radiology images demonstrate satisfactory alignment of the components in the left hip arthroplasty without periprosthetic fracture. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding into the left hip post-op: The patient's low hemoglobin levels and oozing at the surgical site raise the possibility of bleeding into the surgical area.
2. Medication-related hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to medications such as Lasix (furosemide), beta-blockers, and narcotics.
3. Falsely low blood pressure due to atherosclerosis: The patient's atherosclerosis could contribute to falsely low blood pressure readings.
4. Anemia: The drop in hemoglobin levels indicates anemia, which may be due to bleeding or other causes.
5. Complications from anticoagulation: The patient is being anticoagulated with LMWH bridging to coumadin, which could complicate bleeding from or at the surgical site.
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of COPD and eosinophilic lung disease, so there is a risk of pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD.
7. Heart failure: The patient has a history of CHF, and hypotension and tachycardia could be signs of heart failure exacerbation.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and surgery. Prophylaxis measures include boots, lovenox, and coumadin.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female who underwent total hip replacement (THR) surgery and is currently admitted with postoperative hypotension and tachycardia. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and allergies to certain medications. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with improved blood pressure today. She received a blood transfusion and her medications that may have caused the reaction were minimized. There is no clear evidence of a new significant septic insult. The patient's respiratory support includes incentive spirometry, and she will need to continue with MDI for COPD management. Mobilization is encouraged as soon as possible, especially with the completion of hip replacement. Anticoagulation is in place for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is receiving prophylaxis for stress ulcers and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion to vital organs, which can lead to organ damage if not promptly managed.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's increased heart rate may be a compensatory mechanism for hypotension, but sustained tachycardia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia.
