","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old man with no previous medical history who presented to the hospital with acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and was found to have extensive severe coronary artery disease (CAD) on cardiac catheterization. He was transferred to another hospital for evaluation for possible coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure within normal range, a heart rate of 63 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD) to the angle of the jaw, a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops, clear lung fields, and pitting edema to the shins bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. The troponin-T level remains within normal range.

The patient's plan includes continuous aspirin therapy, statin therapy, holding Plavix due to possible CABG, holding beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors given hypotension in the ambulance, repeat cardiac enzymes in the morning, lipid panel and HbA1c follow-up, cardiac surgery consult, and possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic heart disease. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), aspirin, atorvastatin, senna, bisacodyl, and docusate sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and is not on any mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood glucose level is 111 mg/dL, and all other lab results are within normal range except for slightly elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and surveillance for symptoms such as swelling, pain, and redness in the lower extremities should be performed.

2. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors to prevent stress-related mucosal disease. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as melena or hematemesis, should be done.

3. Ventilator-Associated"

","The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and extensive severe coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the hospital with symptoms of CHF and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe CAD. The patient is currently being evaluated for possible coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He is in sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD) to the angle of the jaw, a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, and no murmurs or gallops. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, and there is pitting edema to the shins bilaterally.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.0 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 42.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 160,000/mm³, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, glucose of 111 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 86-year-old man with no prior medical history who presented to the hospital with acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).
- He was found to have extensive severe coronary artery disease (CAD) on cardiac catheterization and was transferred to another hospital for evaluation for possible coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
- The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is being treated for acute systolic CHF. He has been diuresed well with Lasix, but continues to be fluid overloaded with peripheral edema and pleural effusions.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD) to the angle of the jaw, a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, regular rate and rhythm, and no murmurs or gallops.
- The patient has pitting edema to the shins bilaterally.
- Laboratory results show elevated creatinine (Cr) levels at 1.3 mg/dL, likely due to diuresis. Other labs are"
