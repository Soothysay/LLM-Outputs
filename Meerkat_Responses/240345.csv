","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice, acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (AF), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient presented with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and was found to have brisk bleeding evidenced by melena. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which was negative for any evidence of bleeding. An angiogram and subsequent embolization of a bleeding vessel were performed. The patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 2 bags of platelets, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). His vital signs are currently stable with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 120/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to worsening congestive heart failure. He has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 50s and is being followed up for platelet antibodies. The patient is also on antiplatelet agents including Plavix and aspirin. His blood glucose levels are being managed with insulin sliding scale. He has a history of COPD and diabetes. The patient"

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was negative, but an angiogram and subsequent embolization of a bleeding vessel were performed. The patient has received 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 2 bags of platelets, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
- Heart rate: 60 bpm (range 60-107 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 120/58 mmHg (range 92/37-162/97 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute (range 10-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The respiratory support settings are as follows:
- Ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow

   # ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA - pt w/ hx of GI bleed and recent
   antiplatelet agents. EGD negative, s/p angiogram and embolization of
   [**Female First Name (un) **]. s/p 12units PRBC, 2 bags platelets, 2 units FFP. Brisk bleed as
   evidenced by melena again, no Hct stable, transfused one unit.  IR
   recommends surgical internvention should rebleeding become
   significant.
   - IV PPI
   - 2 18gauge IV
   - aggressive resuscitation w/ blood to goal CRIT 30. Check CBC/coags
   Q4hours
   - active T&S, crossmatch
   -considering dye load w/ angiogram, IR would like us to trend
   creatinine/renal function
   # ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - The patient appears to
   still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated
   JVP and crackles on exam. We only expect this to worsen as he receives
   blood for his acute GI bleed, so intubation and mechanical ventilation
   is necessary fo EGD.
   - Hold diuresis for now given potential for hypotension
   - Mechanical ventilation- barriers to extubation are sedation and fluid
   overload. Will check CXR to eval fluid status (good sats so far), will
   give 40mg IV lasix for diuresis if stable crits and BP
   - Cont. home digoxin- check level today
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA - Precipitous drop in platelets from 220 from
   admission to 50s concerning for possible HIT (received heparin at OSH),
   though may also be explained by receiving Plavix and integrillin.
   Aspirin being held.  Plt 102 after transfusion
   - f/u platelet Ab, ? low pretest probability for HIT.
   - No heparin, though not starting argatroban in absence of thrombosis
   and alternate explanation for thrombocytopenia
   - pt s/p platelet transfusion
   # CAD - s/p PCI. Cont. Plavix, statin as long as bleed stable. Cards
   rec continuing .   plavix alone x2 wks, then asa 325 without plavix

   plavix is stopped.
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - patient has underlying atrial fibrillation,
   v-paced
   - monitor on tele, continue digoxin
   - no Coumadin at this time given his history of melena and GI bleed.
   #COPD - appears to be stable on clinical exam
   - will continue on home medications, albuterol and spiriva MDIs

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 15 years ago, acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient presented with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a precipitous drop in platelets from 220 to 50s, which is concerning for possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, it may also be explained by receiving Plavix and integrillin. The patient received a platelet transfusion, and further evaluation of platelet antibodies is planned.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and his recent blood loss anemia and transfusions may worsen renal function. The patient's creatinine levels are trending upward, indicating potential deterioration of renal function.

3. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed and recent antiplatelet agents. Despite angiogram and embolization of a bleeding vessel, the patient continues to experience brisk bleeding evidenced by melena. The patient has received 12 units of packed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and recent percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient presented with acute gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena), and was found to have thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and a history of COPD.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed and recent antiplatelet agents. Endoscopy was negative, and the patient underwent angiogram and embolization of a bleeding vessel. The patient received 12 units of packed red blood cells, 2 bags of platelets, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. Despite these interventions, the patient experienced another episode of brisk bleeding, and the hematocrit level remained stable. The interventional radiology team recommended surgical intervention if significant rebleeding occurs. The patient is a poor candidate for surgical intervention unless urgent.

2. Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Heart Failure: The patient appears to still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given the elevated jugular venous pressure and crackles on examination. Diuretic therapy has been held due to the potential for hypotension. Mechanical ventilation is ongoing, and the patient will be evaluated for extubation barriers such as sedation and fluid overload.

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2, acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) now with acute gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is intubated due to respiratory failure. He has a precipitous drop in platelets, likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and is also experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to angiogram IV contrast or CHF. The patient has a history of COPD, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's recent GI bleed and use of antiplatelet agents may have resulted in significant blood loss, leading to acute anemia. The patient has received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), but his hematocrit (Hct) continues to trend down.
2. Acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure: The patient still exhibits signs of congestive heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and crackles on examination. His current condition suggests ongoing fluid overload.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CABGx2, acute exacerbation of CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and recent PCI, now presenting with acute GI bleed. 

The patient's recent events include bronchoscopy, invasive ventilation, blood cultured, urine culture, and fever. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.6, heart rate of 60-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 54/41 to 158/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 (18-33) breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates an increase in total in fluids and a decrease in total out fluids, resulting in a negative fluid balance. 

The respiratory support shows the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and plateau pressure at 27 cmH2O. 

The physical examination reveals no signs of respiratory distress or abnormal lung sounds, but the patient does have edema in the extremities. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactic acid"

   acute exacerbation of CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   Afib, and recent PCI now with acute GI bleed.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt still intubated after bronchoscopy for
   clearance of mucus plug.  CXR shows opacification in LLL.  Pt also has
   fever and elevated WBC, consistent with PNA.  Started Vanco, Cefepime,
   Flagyl.  Started on Contact precautions.   [**Name2 (NI) **] also has CHF and evidence
   of fluid on CXR, likely contributing to his high ventilation
   requirement.
   - continue Vanco, Cefepime, Flagyl (day 1 = [**9-25**])
   - diuresis limited by renal failure, low urine output and hypotension
   - increasing sedation to reduce overventilation and alkylosis, on max
   doses of Fenanyl and Versed, holding propfol given low BP
   .
   # ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - The patient appears to
   still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated
   JVP and crackles on exam.
   - Hold diuresis for now given hypotenion.  He is intravascularly
   deplete, and BP not responsive to fluid bolus.
   - consider addition of levophed if BP remains low and unable to
   maintain UOP goal of 40cc/hr
   - Cont. home digoxin- check level today
   #Acute renal failure
 primarily  attributed to ATN  [**1-30**] to angiogram
   IV contrast, not improving due to poor renal perfusion.  Pt has
   significant volume overload, but is intravascularly depelte.
   Maximizing cardiac output may help, however use of BB limited by
   hypotension.
   - continue to follow
   - consider addition of pressors
   # ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA - pt w/ hx of GI bleed and recent
   antiplatelet agents.  EGD negative, s/p angiogram and embolization of

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a past history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). He presented with an acute exacerbation of CHF, atrial fibrillation (AF), recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, COPD, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is evidence of pneumonia with fever and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's ventilation requirements are high, likely due to fluid overload and CHF. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Heart Failure: The patient appears to still be in some degree of congestive heart failure with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and crackles on examination. Diuretics are being held due to hypotension, but may need to be restarted once the patient's blood pressure stabilizes. Addition of vasopressors may be considered if blood pressure remains low.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure primarily attributed to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from angiogram and poor renal perfusion. Maximizing cardiac output and considering addition of pressors may"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 78 y.o male with past hx of CABGx2 15 years ago,
   acute exacerbation of CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   Afib, and recent PCI now with acute GI bleed.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt still intubated after bronchoscopy for
   clearance of mucus plug.  CXR shows opacification in LLL.  Pt also has
   fever and elevated WBC, consistent with PNA.  Started Vanco, Cefepime,
   Flagyl.  Started on Contact precautions.   [**Name2 (NI) **] also has CHF and evidence
   of fluid on CXR, likely contributing to his high ventilation
   requirement.
   - continue Vanco, Cefepime, Flagyl (day 1 = [**9-25**]), 8 day course
   - started Lasix drip
   - increasing sedation to reduce overventilation and alkylosis, on max
   doses of Fenanyl and Versed, reduce sedation to increase BP.
   # ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - The patient appears to
   still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated
   JVP and crackles on exam.
   - Hold diuresis for now given hypotension.  He is intravascularly
   deplete, and BP not responsive to fluid bolus.
   - consider addition of levophed if BP remains low and unable to
   maintain UOP goal of 40cc/hr
   - Cont. home digoxin- check level today
   - call cardiology on whether pt should remain on digoxin
   - TTE
   #Acute renal failure
 primarily  attributed to ATN  [**1-30**] to angiogram
   IV contrast, not improving due to poor renal perfusion.  Pt has
   significant volume overload, but is intravascularly depelte.
   Maximizing cardiac output may help, however use of BB limited by
   hypotension.
   - continue to follow
   - consider addition of pressors
   # ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA - pt w/ hx of GI bleed and recent
   antiplatelet agents.  EGD negative, s/p angiogram and embolization of
   [**Female First Name (un) **]. s/p 12units PRBC, 2 bags platelets, 2 units FFP. No more melanotic
   stools, Hct continues to trend down.  He was not transfused.  IR
   recommends surgical internvention should rebleeding become significant,
   given difficulty finding bleed at last intervention.     Pt poor
   candidate for surgical intervention unless urgent.  No significant
   melanotic stools.  Hct stable at 30.
   - PPI
   - maintain access -  PICC
   - aggressive resuscitation w/ blood to goal CRIT 30. Check CBC/coags
   Q12hours
   - active T&S, crossmatch
   - surgery consulted in case of hemodynamic instabiltiy
   - GI signed off given no active bleeding.
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA - Precipitous drop in platelets from 220 from
   admission to 50s concerning for possible HIT (received heparin at OSH),
   though may also be explained by receiving Plavix and integrillin.
   Aspirin being held.  Plt 102 after transfusion.  Increased to 149.
   HIT Ab is positive.
   - No heparin, though not starting argatroban in absence of thrombosis
   and alternate explanation for thrombocytopenia
   - pt s/p platelet transfusion
   - PICC line is heparin coated, receiving saline flushes q4h, to prevent
   heparin effect
   - trend platelets
   # CAD - s/p PCI. Cont. Plavix, statin as long as bleed stable. Cards
   rec continuing .   plavix alone x2 wks, then asa 325 without plavix
   indefinitely.  Cards would like to be informed if bleeding recurs and
   plavix is stopped.  Pt on lipitor.
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - patient has underlying atrial fibrillation,
   v-paced
   - monitor on tele, continue digoxin
   - no Coumadin at this time given his history of melena and GI bleed.
   #COPD - appears to be stable on clinical exam
   - will continue on home medications, albuterol and spiriva MDIs
   #DIABETES - Insulin sliding scale.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated after a bronchoscopy for clearance of mucus plug. He also has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, which is consistent with pneumonia. He is on mechanical ventilation and has evidence of fluid on chest X-ray, likely contributing to his high ventilation requirement.

2. Acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure: The patient appears to still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated jugular venous pressure and crackles on examination. His blood pressure is hypotensive and not responsive to fluid bolus.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure primarily attributed to acute tubular necrosis due to IV contrast during angiogram. His renal function is worsening despite fluid resuscitation.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a precipitous drop in platelets from 220 to 50s, concerning for possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). He received heparin at the outside hospital, and his HIT antibody test is positive.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 78 y.o male with past hx of CABGx2 15 years ago,
   acute exacerbation of CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   Afib, and recent PCI now with acute GI bleed.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt still intubated after bronchoscopy for
   clearance of mucus plug.  CXR shows opacification in LLL.  Pt also has
   fever and elevated WBC, consistent with PNA.  Started Vanco, Cefepime,
   Flagyl.  Started on Contact precautions.   [**Name2 (NI) **] also has CHF and evidence
   of fluid on CXR, likely contributing to his high ventilation
   requirement.
   - continue Vanco, Cefepime, Flagyl (day 1 = [**9-25**]), 8 day course
   - preliminary cultures show Gram positive pairs/chains, can d/c Flagyl
   - Vanco trough tomorrow
   - started Lasix drip with addition of metolazone (assess of dig
   toxicitiy with metolazone)
   - q8 lytes
   - daily metolazone with Lasix for UOP.
   - increasing sedation to reduce overventilation and alkylosis, on max
   doses of Fenanyl and Versed, reduce sedation to increase BP.
   - AM CXR
   # Urine - UA dirty, urine culture showed Staph aureus.  Sensitivities
   pending.  Pt already on broad coverage.
   - change foley today
   # ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - The patient appears to
   still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated
   JVP and crackles on exam.   ECHO shows significant systolic
   dysfunction, and aortic stenosis.
   - dig level 1.1, appropriate
   - call cardiology re management of CHF, digoxin seems appropriate in
   light of EF 30% ho of O2 at 4L requirement at home
   - he is preload dependent, so careful monitoring of diuresis is
   warranted
   - no BB in acute exacerbation, but should be started when out of
   pulmonary edema
   #Hypernatremia - Na 147, not receiving regular free water boluses as he
   has not been tolerating tube feeds.
   - consider D5W if does not improve.
   #Acute renal failure
 primarily  attributed to ATN  [**1-30**] to angiogram
   IV contrast, not improving due to poor renal perfusion.  Pt has
   significant volume overload, but poor perfusion.   Maximizing cardiac
   output with aggressive diuresis and digoxin.
   - continue to follow Cr
   - renally dose medications
   - consider addition of pressors if worsenining renal function,
   hyptoentsion, and  poor UOP
   # ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA - pt w/ hx of GI bleed and recent
   antiplatelet agents.  EGD negative, s/p angiogram and embolization of
   [**Female First Name (un) **]. s/p 12units PRBC, 2 bags platelets, 2 units FFP. No more melanotic
   stools, Hct continues to trend down.  He was not transfused.  IR
   recommends surgical internvention should rebleeding become significant,
   given difficulty finding bleed at last intervention.     Pt poor
   candidate for surgical intervention unless urgent.  No significant
   melanotic stools.  Hct stable at 30.
   - continue PPI
   - maintain access -  PICC
   - aggressive resuscitation w/ blood to goal CRIT 30. Check CBC/coags
   Q12hours
   - active T&S, crossmatch
   - surgery aware  in case of hemodynamic instabiltiy
   - GI signed off given no active bleeding.
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA - Precipitous drop in platelets from 220 from
   admission to 50s concerning for possible HIT (received heparin at OSH),
   though may also be explained by receiving Plavix and integrillin.
   Aspirin being held.  Plt 102 after transfusion.  Increased to 171.
   HIT Ab is positive.
   - No heparin, though not starting argatroban in absence of thrombosis
   and alternate explanation for thrombocytopenia
   - pt s/p platelet transfusion
   - PICC line is heparin coated, receiving saline flushes q4h, to prevent
   heparin effect
   - trend platelets
   - consider seratonin release assay to confirm HIT
   # CAD - s/p PCI. Cont. Plavix, statin as long as bleed stable. Cards
   rec continuing .   plavix alone x2 wks, then asa 325 without plavix
   indefinitely.  Cards would like to be informed if bleeding recurs and
   plavix is stopped.  Pt on lipitor.
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - patient has underlying atrial fibrillation,
   v-paced
   - monitor on tele, continue digoxin
   - no Coumadin at this time given his history of melena and GI bleed.
   #COPD - appears to be stable on clinical exam
   - will continue on home medications, albuterol and spiriva MDIs
   #DIABETES - Insulin sliding scale.
   # FEN: replace lytes as needed,  TF started slowly, increase as
   tolerated.
   # ACCESS: PICC, RArterial
   # PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He presented to the ICU with acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated after bronchoscopy for clearance of mucus plug. He has fever and elevated white blood cell count, consistent with pneumonia. Started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco, Cefepime, Flagyl) and contact precautions. Continue with the same antibiotics, and assess vancomycin trough tomorrow.
2. Urinary tract infection: Urine culture showed Staphylococcus aureus. Sensitivities pending. Pt already on broad coverage.
3. Acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure: The patient appears to still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated jugular venous pressure and crackles on exam. ECHO shows significant systolic dysfunction, and aortic stenosis. Call cardiology for management of CHF, digoxin seems appropriate in light of EF 30% ho of O2 at 4L requirement at home.
4. Hypernatremia: Na 147, not receiving regular free water boluses as he has not been tolerating tube feeds. Consider D5W if does not improve.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He presented with acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF), respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and pneumonia, and his urine culture shows the same organism. The patient's condition is complicated by hypernatremia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia with a possible diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and acute blood loss anemia due to his recent gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to his respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to chronic kidney disease.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has experienced a significant drop in platelet count, which could increase the risk of bleeding complications. HIT should be considered, and appropriate management should be implemented.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has stabilized, there is still a risk of rebleeding, especially given his history of gastrointestinal"

   Afib, and recent PCI now with acute GI bleed.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt reintubated given increasing dyspnea, left
   lung collapse.  Currently on 50% FiO2 with PEEP of 10; high peep can
   help to re-expand, recruit collapsed left lobe.  Cause of collapse
   likely secondary to increased secretions, continued pnuemonia.
   -Encourage aggressive chest PT, nebs, continued assist control.
   -Continue vanc and cefepime for coverage of HAP;  f.u sputum cxs.
   Track Rsided consolidation; if continuing to icnrease, consider tx
   failure, could be secondary to aspiration PNA.  [**Month (only) 51**] not be covering
   anaerobes.
   - on lasix drip at low rate 2 /hr; unclear how much CHF is contributing
   to dyspnea and respiratory distress:  was -2 L yesterday; maintain goal
   of -1.5 - 2 L and continue on low lasix drip.  Check Is and Os
   tonight.
   -Tendency to overbreath vent and becomes alkalotic, titrate fentanyl +
   versed to decrease minute ventilation
   -
   .
   # ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - The patient appears to
   still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated
   JVP and crackles on exam.   ECHO shows significant systolic dysfunction
   (EF 35%), and aortic stenosis.
   - continue lasix drip today; cardiology following, f/u recs
   - continue digitalis, most recent dig level 1.1, WNL
   .
   #Hypernatremia - Na 147, not receiving regular free water boluses as he
   has not been tolerating tube feeds.
   -Hasn't been tolerating TF/free water flushes, try D5W
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 primarily  attributed to ATN  [**1-30**] to angiogram
   IV contrast, further being exacerbated by continued poor renal
   perfusion.  Pt has significant volume overload, but poor perfusion.
   Maximizing cardiac output with aggressive diuresis and digoxin.
   - continue to follow Cr; stable over last 2 days
   - renally dose medications; recheck Dig level
   # ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA - pt w/ hx of GI bleed and recent
   antiplatelet agents.  EGD negative, s/p angiogram and embolization of
   [**Female First Name (un) **]. s/p 12units PRBC, 2 bags platelets, 2 units FFP. No more melanotic
   stools, Hct stable over last couple days.  He was not transfused.  IR
   recommends surgical internvention should rebleeding become significant,
   given difficulty finding bleed at last intervention.     Pt poor
   candidate for surgical intervention unless urgent.  No significant
   melanotic stools.  Hct stable at 30.
   - On lansoprazole, would continue, but consider changing to H2 blocker
   given that PPI can increase concentrations of plavix;
   - maintain access -  PICC
   - Goal HCT 30, currently above goal, continue to trend HCT q12 daily
   - active T&S, crossmatch
   - surgery aware  in case of hemodynamic instabiltiy
   - GI signed off given no active bleeding.
    .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA - Precipitous drop in platelets from 220 from
   admission to 50s concerning for possible HIT (received heparin at OSH);
   could potentially be explained by integrillin.  Aspirin being held.
   Plt 102 after transfusion.  Increased to 171.   HIT Ab is positive.
   Given optical density, 1-5% chance of HIT; serotonin release assay is
   pending.  Pretest probability intermediate.
   -All heparion D/c'd, receiving saline flushes q4 through PICC line, not
   starting argatroban in absence of thrombosis and alternate explanation
   for thrombocytopenia
   - trend platelets
   - F/u seratonin release assay to confirm HIT
   .
   # CAD - s/p PCI. Cont. Plavix, statin as long as bleed stable. Cards
   rec continuing .   plavix alone x2 wks, then asa 325 without plavix
   indefinitely.  Cards would like to be informed if bleeding recurs and
   plavix is stopped.  Pt on lipitor.
   .
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - patient has underlying atrial fibrillation,
   v-paced
   - monitor on tele, continue digoxin
   - no Coumadin at this time given his history of melena and GI bleed.
   .
   #COPD - appears to be stable on clinical exam
   - will continue on home medications, albuterol and spiriva MDIs

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 15 years ago, acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been reintubated due to increasing dyspnea and left lung collapse. He is on 50% FiO2 with PEEP of 10, and aggressive chest physiotherapy, nebs, and assist control ventilation are recommended. There is a concern for pneumonia and potential aspiration pneumonitis.
2. Acute Exacerbation of CHF: The patient shows signs of congestive heart failure with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and crackles on exam. Significant systolic dysfunction is noted on echocardiogram, and aortic stenosis is present. Lasix drip is being continued, and cardiology follow-up is recommended.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 147, and he is not tolerating tube feeds or free water flushes. D5W is being tried to correct the hypernatremia.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to contrast-induced acute tubular necrosis ("

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 78 y.o male with past hx of CABGx2 15 years ago,
   acute exacerbation of CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   Afib, and recent PCI now with acute GI bleed.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt reintubated given increasing dyspnea, left
   lung collapse.  Currently on 50% FiO2 with PEEP of 10; high peep can
   help to re-expand, recruit collapsed left lobe.  Cause of collapse
   likely secondary to increased secretions, continued pnuemonia.
   -Encourage aggressive chest PT, nebs, continued assist control.
   -Continue vanc and cefepime for coverage of HAP;  f.u sputum cxs.
   Track Rsided consolidation; if continuing to icnrease, consider tx
   failure, could be secondary to aspiration PNA.  [**Month (only) 51**] not be covering
   anaerobes.
   - on lasix drip at low rate 2 /hr; unclear how much CHF is contributing
   to dyspnea and respiratory distress:  was -2 L yesterday; maintain goal
   of -1.5 - 2 L and continue on low lasix drip.  Check Is and Os
   tonight.
   -Tendency to overbreath vent and becomes alkalotic, titrate fentanyl +
   versed to decrease minute ventilation
   -
   .
   # ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - The patient appears to
   still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated
   JVP and crackles on exam.   ECHO shows significant systolic dysfunction
   (EF 35%), and aortic stenosis.
   - continue lasix drip today; cardiology following, f/u recs
   - continue digitalis, most recent dig level 1.1, WNL
   .
   #Hypernatremia - Na 147, not receiving regular free water boluses as he
   has not been tolerating tube feeds.
   -Hasn't been tolerating TF/free water flushes, try D5W
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 primarily  attributed to ATN  [**1-30**] to angiogram
   IV contrast, further being exacerbated by continued poor renal
   perfusion.  Pt has significant volume overload, but poor perfusion.
   Maximizing cardiac output with aggressive diuresis and digoxin.
   - continue to follow Cr; stable over last 2 days
   - renally dose medications; recheck Dig level
   # ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA - pt w/ hx of GI bleed and recent
   antiplatelet agents.  EGD negative, s/p angiogram and embolization of
   [**Female First Name (un) **]. s/p 12units PRBC, 2 bags platelets, 2 units FFP. No more melanotic
   stools, Hct stable over last couple days.  He was not transfused.  IR
   recommends surgical internvention should rebleeding become significant,
   given difficulty finding bleed at last intervention.     Pt poor
   candidate for surgical intervention unless urgent.  No significant
   melanotic stools.  Hct stable at 30.
   - On lansoprazole, would continue, but consider changing to H2 blocker
   given that PPI can increase concentrations of plavix;
   - maintain access -  PICC
   - Goal HCT 30, currently above goal, continue to trend HCT q12 daily
   - active T&S, crossmatch
   - surgery aware  in case of hemodynamic instabiltiy
   - GI signed off given no active bleeding.
    .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA - Precipitous drop in platelets from 220 from
   admission to 50s concerning for possible HIT (received heparin at OSH);
   could potentially be explained by integrillin.  Aspirin being held.
   Plt 102 after transfusion.  Increased to 171.   HIT Ab is positive.
   Given optical density, 1-5% chance of HIT; serotonin release assay is
   pending.  Pretest probability intermediate.
   -All heparion D/c'd, receiving saline flushes q4 through PICC line, not
   starting argatroban in absence of thrombosis and alternate explanation
   for thrombocytopenia
   - trend platelets
   - F/u seratonin release assay to confirm HIT
   .
   # CAD - s/p PCI. Cont. Plavix, statin as long as bleed stable. Cards
   rec continuing .   plavix alone x2 wks, then asa 325 without plavix
   indefinitely.  Cards would like to be informed if bleeding recurs and
   plavix is stopped.  Pt on lipitor.
   .
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - patient has underlying atrial fibrillation,
   v-paced
   - monitor on tele, continue digoxin
   - no Coumadin at this time given his history of melena and GI bleed.
   .
   #COPD - appears to be stable on clinical exam
   - will continue on home medications, albuterol and spiriva MDIs
   .
   # Urine - UA dirty, urine culture showed Staph aureus.  Sensitivities
   pending.  Pt already on broad coverage.
   .
   #DIABETES - Insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # FEN: replace lytes as needed,  TF started slowly, increase as
   tolerated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of CABGx2, acute exacerbation of CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and recent PCI. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, hypernatremia, acute renal failure primarily attributed to ATN due to IV contrast, acute blood loss anemia, thrombocytopenia, CAD, atrial fibrillation, COPD, urine infection, diabetes, and fen. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including respiratory support, diuretics, antibiotics, and transfusions. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are potential medical complications that could arise. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been reintubated and is currently on 50% FiO2 with PEEP of 10. There is a concern for continued pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis, which may require adjustment in ventilation parameters or consideration of a different treatment approach.
2. Acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure: The patient still shows signs of congestive heart failure with elevated JVP and crackles on exam. Continued management with diuretics and cardiac isotropes may be necessary, and cardiology follow-up is recommended.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 147. Free water"

   Assessment and Plan
 AFIB:  V-paced, on digoxin.  Holding coumadin.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, HYPERNATREMIA:  Sodium improved with
   free water replacement.  Continue to monitor labs.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE):  Continues on
   plavix.  Restart ASA given stable hcts.  Elevated troponins, likely
   demand ischemia in setting of worsening respiratory status.
 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE/AORTIC STENOSIS:  Gentle diuresis with lasix
   drip. Follow electrolytes.  Goal for 100 cc/hr urine output, 500 cc
   negative/24 hours.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Secondary to inability to
   handle secretions and mucus plugging with left lung collapse.
   Reintubated overnight.  Repeat CXR shows persistent collapse shortly
   after intubation.  Repeat sputum gram stain and culture.  Albumin 2.2,
   likley contributing to total body fluid overload.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, previous percutaneous coronary intervention, gastrointestinal bleeding, and congestive heart failure. The patient presents with respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and congestive heart failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and requires critical care management.

The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and the use of accessory muscles. He continues to diurese and has not improved with bronchodilators or chest physiotherapy. The patient was intubated at approximately 2:00 am due to large amounts of thick oral secretions. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 50, and PaO2 of 95. A chest X-ray reveals left lung collapse.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode (AC), tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O. His cardiac enzymes are trending down slightly, and his digoxin level is 0.7.

The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, and his medication includes furosemide, morphine sulfate, metronidazole"

   Afib, and recent PCI now with acute GI bleed.
   # Respiratory failure
 patient currently on CMV assist with PEEP of 8
   and TV of 400 and PIP of 27
   - consider bronchoscopy for re-expansion of Lingula
   - continue aggressive chest PT and nebulizers
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime for HAP flora and f/u sputum Cx and
   daily CXR
   - continue gentle diuresis with Lasix drip as clinically fluid
   overloaded with goal -1L, track BNP
s as indicator of progress ([**Numeric Identifier 10488**])
   - titrate sedation to help reduce RR
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient continues to appear clinically
   fluid overloaded despite being negative for LOS, represents patient was
   likely fluid overloaded at initial presentation.
   - continue gentle diuresis via Lasix gtt
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   #Hypernatremia - Na 141 this AM:
   - will continue free water flushes with tube feeds or D5W PRN
   hypernatremia
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes in setting of Lasix gtt
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 2.2 (stable) from baseline
   1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.
   - follow daily Cr and UOP, on lasix gtt
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  Patient had single melanotic stool yesterday which may
   represent old blood as patient has been constipated since admission to
   unit.  HCT remains stable.
   - continue to trend with [**Hospital1 7**] HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA unless active GIB with falling HCT as
   patient had recent PCI with stent placement
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to defer argatroban unless clinical picture is more
   concerning for HIT
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   # CAD
 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Cardiac enzymes have remained stable.
   - continue statin and anti-platelet agents unless evidence of active

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He presented with gastrointestinal bleeding after being placed on Plavix and integrillin following a recent PCI. He is currently experiencing fluid overload, hypoxic respiratory failure, and possible underlying pneumonia. The patient has a maroon bowel movement, elevated urine output, and an imbalance in fluid balance. He is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, and Lasix. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and fluid overload. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient appears clinically fluid overloaded, which can exacerbate his underlying congestive heart failure. This can lead to worsening of cardiac function, pulmonary edema, and peripheral edema.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential acute kidney injury, possibly due to the combination of fluid overload, hypotension, and use of nephrotoxic medications. This can result in further deterioration in renal function, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Hypernatremia: The"

   # Respiratory failure
 patient currently on CMV assist with PEEP of 8
   and TV of 400 and PIP of 27
   - consider bronchoscopy for re-expansion of Lingula
   - continue aggressive chest PT and nebulizers
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime for HAP flora and f/u sputum Cx and
   daily CXR
   - continue gentle diuresis with Lasix drip as clinically fluid
   overloaded with goal -1L, track BNP
s as indicator of progress ([**Numeric Identifier 10488**])
   - titrate sedation to help reduce RR
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient continues to appear clinically
   fluid overloaded despite being negative for LOS, represents patient was
   likely fluid overloaded at initial presentation.
   - continue gentle diuresis via Lasix gtt
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   #Hypernatremia - Na 141 this AM:
   - will continue free water flushes with tube feeds or D5W PRN
   hypernatremia
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes in setting of Lasix gtt
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 2.2 (stable) from baseline
   1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.
   - follow daily Cr and UOP, on lasix gtt
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  Patient had single melanotic stool yesterday which may
   represent old blood as patient has been constipated since admission to
   unit.  HCT remains stable.
   - continue to trend with [**Hospital1 7**] HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA unless active GIB with falling HCT as
   patient had recent PCI with stent placement
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to defer argatroban unless clinical picture is more
   concerning for HIT
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding after being placed on Plavix and integrillin following a recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He is now experiencing fluid overload, hypoxic respiratory failure, and possible underlying pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate is 60 bpm, blood pressure is 120/50 mmHg, respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 24, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.56, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, HCO3- of 198 mEq/L, and base excess of +6.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.3%, platelet count of 225 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 30 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) of 2.2 mg/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride of 104 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, calcium of 8.1 mg/dL, glucose of 152 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 34 mg/dL. His urine cultures are positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and his blood culture is pending. His chest X-ray shows re-expansion of the left upper lobe (LUL) with most of the lingula remaining collapsed, a small left pleural effusion, and hyperinflation of the right lung with decreased edema and smaller consolidation in the right lower lobe (RLL).

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), thrombocytopenia, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, and urinary tract infection (UTI)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2, acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after being placed on Plavix and integrillin, fluid overload, hypoxic respiratory failure, and possible underlying pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, GIB, thrombocytopenia, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 and tidal volume (TV) of 400. The plateau pressure is 22 cmH2O, indicating a risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and daily chest X-rays is necessary to assess lung re-expansion and prevent further complications.

2. Congestive heart failure: The patient appears clinically fluid overloaded despite being negative for loss of sodium (LOS). Gentle diuresis with Lasix should be continued to manage fluid overload and track B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels as an indicator of progress.

   lower lung volumes is responsible for exaggeration of right infrahilar
   consolidation, probably
   pneumonia
   [**2108-9-26**] (echo):  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2108-9-19**], the findings are similar with moderately depressed
   biventricular function, moderate aortic stenosis, mild aortic and mild
   mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension.  LVEF 35%
   Microbiology: 1) Gram + cocci in sputum

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 78 y.o male with past hx of CABGx2 15 years ago,
   acute exacerbation of CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   Afib, and recent PCI now with acute GI bleed.
   # Respiratory failure
 Continued left sided lung collapse.  Patient
   currently on CMV assist with PEEP of 8 and TV of 400 and PIP of 25:
   - continue aggressive chest PT and nebulizers; have tried increasing
   PEEP in past to 12 but did not improve;
   - continue reduced dose of vancomycin and cefepime for HAP flora and
   f/u sputum Cx and daily CXR; likely to be good coverage as patient has
   remained afebrile with no change in WBC count
   - continue gentle diuresis with Lasix drip as clinically fluid
   overloaded with goal -1L, track BNP
s as indicator of progress ([**Numeric Identifier 10488**])
   - titrate sedation to help reduce RR
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient continues to appear clinically and
   radiologically fluid overloaded despite being overall -1 L negative;
   last night was just under -1 L
   - increase lasix drip to 10 mg/hr
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   #Hypernatremia - Na stable at 141 last couple days.
   - will continue free water flushes with tube feeds or D5W PRN
   hypernatremia
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes in setting of Lasix gtt
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 2.2 (stable) from baseline
   1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.
   - follow daily Cr and UOP, on lasix gtt
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  Patient had single melanotic stool yesterday which may
   represent old blood as patient has been constipated since admission to
   unit.  HCT very slow trend down likely secondary to blood draws;
   currently at 31.
   - continue to trend with [**Hospital1 7**] HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA unless active GIB with falling HCT as
   patient had recent PCI with stent placement
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to defer argatroban unless clinical picture is more
   concerning for HIT
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   # CAD
 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Telemetry shows occasional pauses, EKG reveals non-specific ST changes;
   cardiac enzymes being recycled with first set stable.
   -contine to cycle X 2
   - continue statin and anti-platelet agents unless evidence of active
   GIB
   # Atrial Fibrillation
 continue to hold anticoagulation in setting of
   recent GIB
   # Urine
 cultures pos. for MSSA, continuing broad spectrum antibiotics
   which should cover the urine flora
   # Diabetes
 continue ISS: sugars are 150-250
   # FEN: [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes with PRN repletion, TF with PRN free water
   flushes; if not tolerating TF, then nutrition recs: consider
   semi-elemental formula, lower fat formula = Peptamen 1.5 with goal of
   60ml/hr = 2160 calories and 98g protein, if patient unable to tolerate
   semi-elemental tube feed
 will need TPN

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 15 years ago, acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) now with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (MV) due to respiratory failure, with left-sided lung collapse. There are multiple medical complications that have been identified and are being managed:

1. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient has continued left-sided lung collapse.
   - Aggressive chest physiotherapy (PT) and nebulizers are being continued.
   - Reduced dose of vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) flora is being continued.
   - Daily chest X-ray (CXR) is being followed.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):
   - The patient appears clinically and radiologically fluid overloaded despite being overall -1 L negative.
   - Lasix drip is being increased to 10 mg/hr.
   - Digoxin is being continued for improved contractility.

3. Hypernatremia:
   - Sodium levels are stable at 141.
   - Free water flushes with tube feeds or D5W PRN are being continued.
   - Lasix gtt is being followed.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 78 yom with hx of CHF, AF  s/p staged PCI for acute
   CHF admitted with GIB in setting of anticoagulation for stent
   placement, now massively fluid overloaded s/p resuscitation requiring
   ventilator support.  Plan is now for aggressive diuresis and then
   planned extubation later this week.
   # Respiratory failure
 continued substantial pulmonary edema with
   retrocardiac atelectasis.  NST 10 (low).
   - cpntinue Vancomycin and Cefepime (? [**8-10**]) for empiric Tx of HAP
   - continue aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt for goal of - 2 L/day
   titrate to BP
   - continue chest PT with nebulizers
   - neuromuscular consult for etiology of continued acute onset weakness
   -
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient with continued fluid overload
   state s/p aggressive resuscitation for GIB, now receiving aggressive
   diuresis
   - continue lasix gtt 12 and consider adding metolazone to achieve
   diuresis goal of -2L / day
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   #Hypernatremia - Na stable at 141 last couple days.
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and treat hypernatremia with free water flushes PRN
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 1.9 (improving) from
   baseline 1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.  Renal
   failure seems to be resolving.
   - continue lasix gtt and add metolazone to achieve diuresis goal
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  HCT very slow trend down likely secondary to blood draws;
   currently at 29.6.  GIB stable.
   - continue to trend with [**Hospital1 7**] HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.  Likely result of Integrilin.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to defer argatroban unless clinical picture is more
   concerning for HIT
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   # CAD
 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Telemetry shows occasional pauses, EKG reveals non-specific ST changes;
   cardiac enzymes being recycled with first set stable.
   - continue statin and anti-platelet agents unless evidence of active
   GIB
   # Atrial Fibrillation
 patient currently in NSR, continue to hold
   anticoagulation in setting of recent GIB
   # Urine
 cultures pos. for MSSA on [**9-25**], continuing broad spectrum

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF), who underwent staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute CHF. The patient was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement. He is now massively fluid overloaded and requires ventilator support after resuscitation.

24-hour events include aggressive diuresis with Lasix, unsuccessful attempts to obtain nasal intubation for respiratory support, self-extubation, and increased sedation. The patient has allergies to heparin agents and has received various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, and Lasix.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/45 to 178/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 2,514 mL and output of 4,250 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,736 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 112.2 kg to 98.4 kg.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV)/assistant mode, set with a tidal volume"

   CHF admitted with GIB in setting of anticoagulation for stent
   placement, now massively fluid overloaded s/p resuscitation requiring
   ventilator support.  Plan is now for aggressive diuresis and then
   planned extubation later this week.
   # Respiratory failure
 continued substantial pulmonary edema with
   retrocardiac atelectasis.  NST 10 (low).
   - cpntinue Vancomycin and Cefepime (? [**8-10**]) for empiric Tx of HAP
   - continue aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt for goal of - 2 L/day
   titrate to BP
   - continue chest PT with nebulizers
   - neuromuscular consult for etiology of continued acute onset weakness
   -
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient with continued fluid overload
   state s/p aggressive resuscitation for GIB, now receiving aggressive
   diuresis
   - continue lasix gtt 12 and consider adding metolazone to achieve
   diuresis goal of -2L / day
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   #Hypernatremia - Na stable at 141 last couple days.
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and treat hypernatremia with free water flushes PRN
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 1.9 (improving) from
   baseline 1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.  Renal
   failure seems to be resolving.
   - continue lasix gtt and add metolazone to achieve diuresis goal
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  HCT very slow trend down likely secondary to blood draws;
   currently at 29.6.  GIB stable.
   - continue to trend with [**Hospital1 7**] HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.  Likely result of Integrilin.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to defer argatroban unless clinical picture is more
   concerning for HIT
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   # CAD
 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Telemetry shows occasional pauses, EKG reveals non-specific ST changes;
   cardiac enzymes being recycled with first set stable.
   - continue statin and anti-platelet agents unless evidence of active
   GIB
   # Atrial Fibrillation
 patient currently in NSR, continue to hold
   anticoagulation in setting of recent GIB
   # Urine
 cultures pos. for MSSA on [**9-25**], continuing broad spectrum

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute CHF. The patient was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement. Since then, the patient has been massively fluid overloaded and required resuscitation, leading to ventilator support.

The patient attempted aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt and failed to achieve the desired fluid output of -2L/day. The patient also attempted to self-extubate last night, and sedation was increased. The patient's respiratory status improved, but they are not over-breathing on the vent this morning.

The patient has allergies to heparin agents, and the last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on [**2108-10-1**] at 08:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl, midazolam, and lasix infusions. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) and unspecified medications. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,514 mL and total output of 4,250 mL since midnight, resulting in a negative balance of -1,736 mL. The patient's weight is currently 98.4 kg, compared to an admission weight of 112.2 kg.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute CHF. The patient was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) while on anticoagulation for stent placement. The patient is now massively fluid overloaded and requires ventilator support.

The patient has experienced several medical complications, including respiratory failure with substantial pulmonary edema and retrocardiac atelectasis, congestive heart failure with continued fluid overload, hypernatremia, acute renal failure (improving), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents s/p PCI, thrombocytopenia (platelet levels initially dropped in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density), coronary artery disease (CAD) s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent placement, atrial fibrillation, and urinary tract infection (cultures positive for MSSA on 9/25).

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure due to continued pulmonary edema, worsening congestive heart failure due to continued fluid overload, further electrolyte imbalances such as hypernatremia, worsening acute renal failure, further gastrointestinal bleeding, development of thrombocytopenia, coronary artery disease progression, worsening atrial fibrillation, and urinary tract infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). He underwent staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute CHF and was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement. The patient is now massively fluid overloaded and requires ventilator support.

The patient attempted aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt but experienced a negative fluid balance of -2L for the day and -3.5L for total fluid output. Respiratory support has been initiated with an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV)/assistant control mode ventilation (ASSIST). Oxygen delivery is set at 40% FiO2, and the ventilator settings include Vt of 400 mL, RR of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and HCO3- of 129 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/45 to 178/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). He underwent staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute CHF and was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement. The patient is now massively fluid overloaded after resuscitation and requires ventilator support.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have substantial pulmonary edema with retrocardiac atelectasis. Noninvasive cardiac monitoring (NST) shows a score of 10 (low). The plan is to continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix and titrate to blood pressure. Chest PT with nebulizers will also be continued. A neuromuscular consult is requested for the etiology of continued acute onset weakness.

2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient is in a continued fluid overload state after aggressive resuscitation for GIB. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix will be continued, and consideration will be given to adding metolazone to achieve a diuresis goal of -2 L/day. Digoxin will be continued for improved contractility, as the patient's ejection fraction is normal at 35%.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are stable at 141 over the last couple of days. Frequent monitoring of electroly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). He was admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement. The patient is now massively fluid overloaded and requires ventilator support after resuscitation. 

The patient has been on aggressive diuresis with Lasix and no creatinine bump. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There is concern for thrombocytopenia, which may be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's platelet count is currently stable at baseline levels.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 100/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and coronary artery disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is requiring ventilator support, indicating severe respiratory distress. This could be"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yom with hx of CHF, AF s/p staged PCI for acute CHF admitted with
   GIB in setting of anticoagulation for stent placement, now massively
   fluid overloaded s/p resuscitation requiring ventilator support.  Plan
   is now for aggressive diuresis and then planned extubation later this
   week.
   # Respiratory failure
 continued substantial pulmonary edema with
   retrocardiac atelectasis.  NST 10 (low).
   - cpntinue Vancomycin and Cefepime (? [**9-10**]) for empiric Tx of HAP
   - continue aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt for goal of - 2 L/day
   titrate to BP
   - continue chest PT with nebulizers
   - consult neurology for etiology of acute onset weakness
 may require
   NM consult
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient with continued fluid overload
   state s/p aggressive resuscitation for GIB, now receiving aggressive
   diuresis
   - continue lasix gtt 12 and consider adding metolazone to achieve
   diuresis goal of -2L / day
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   #Hypernatremia - Na stable at 141 last couple days.
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and treat hypernatremia with free water flushes PRN
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 1.9 (improving) from
   baseline 1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.  Renal
   failure seems to be resolving.
   - continue lasix gtt and add metolazone to achieve diuresis goal
   following [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and Cr
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  HCT very slow trend down likely secondary to blood draws;
   currently at 28.5.  GIB stable.
   - continue to trend with [**Hospital1 7**] HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.  Likely result of Integrilin.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to defer argatroban unless clinical picture is more
   concerning for HIT
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   # CAD
 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Telemetry shows occasional pauses, EKG reveals non-specific ST changes;
   cardiac enzymes being recycled with first set stable.
   - continue statin and anti-platelet agents unless evidence of active
   GIB
   # Atrial Fibrillation
 patient currently in NSR, continue to hold
   anticoagulation in setting of recent GIB
   # Urine
 cultures pos. for MSSA on [**9-25**], continuing broad spectrum
   antibiotics which should cover the urine flora
   # Diabetes
 continue ISS

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 78 yom with hx of CHF, AF  s/p staged PCI for acute
   CHF admitted with GIB in setting of anticoagulation for stent
   placement, now massively fluid overloaded s/p resuscitation requiring
   ventilator support.  Plan is now for aggressive diuresis and then
   planned extubation later this week.
   # Respiratory failure
 continued substantial pulmonary edema with
   retrocardiac atelectasis.  NST 10 (low).
   - cpntinue Vancomycin and Cefepime (? [**8-10**]) for empiric Tx of HAP
   - continue aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt for goal of - 2 L/day
   titrate to BP
   - continue chest PT with nebulizers
   - neuromuscular consult for etiology of continued acute onset weakness
   -
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient with continued fluid overload
   state s/p aggressive resuscitation for GIB, now receiving aggressive
   diuresis
   - continue lasix gtt 12 and consider adding metolazone to achieve
   diuresis goal of -2L / day
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   #Hypernatremia - Na stable at 141 last couple days.
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and treat hypernatremia with free water flushes PRN
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 1.9 (improving) from
   baseline 1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.  Renal
   failure seems to be resolving.
   - continue lasix gtt and add metolazone to achieve diuresis goal
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  HCT very slow trend down likely secondary to blood draws;
   currently at 29.6.  GIB stable.
   - continue to trend with [**Hospital1 7**] HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.  Likely result of Integrilin.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to defer argatroban unless clinical picture is more
   concerning for HIT
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   # CAD
 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Telemetry shows occasional pauses, EKG reveals non-specific ST changes;
   cardiac enzymes being recycled with first set stable.
   - continue statin and anti-platelet agents unless evidence of active
   GIB
   # Atrial Fibrillation
 patient currently in NSR, continue to hold
   anticoagulation in setting of recent GIB

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient underwent staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute CHF and was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement. Currently, the patient is massively fluid overloaded and requires ventilator support.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include respiratory failure with substantial pulmonary edema and retrocardiac atelectasis, congestive heart failure with continued fluid overload, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and coronary artery disease.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure, further fluid overload leading to pulmonary edema, worsening heart failure, electrolyte imbalances, progression of renal failure, recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, low platelet count, and potential cardiac events.

It is important to monitor the patient closely and manage these conditions accordingly to prevent any further complications and improve the patient's overall health status."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement. The patient has been aggressively diuresed and is now massively fluid overloaded, requiring ventilator support. His current plan is for aggressive diuresis followed by planned extubation later this week.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have substantial pulmonary edema with retrocardiac atelectasis, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This could be a result of fluid overload and may require continued ventilator support.

2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient is in a fluid-overloaded state s/p aggressive resuscitation for GIB. He is receiving aggressive diuresis, but clinically appears overloaded, and radiologically shows improved but still present pulmonary edema. This indicates ongoing congestive heart failure, which may require further management, such as afterload reduction and optimization of cardiac contractility.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has stable sodium levels between 139-141 in the last few days. This suggests the need for ongoing monitoring and treatment of hypernatremia with free water flushes as needed.

4. Acute Renal Failure: Initially attributed to dye load from angiogram, exacerbated by poor renal perfusion. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yom with hx of CHF, AF s/p staged PCI for acute CHF admitted with
   GIB in setting of anticoagulation for stent placement, now massively
   fluid overloaded s/p resuscitation requiring ventilator support.  Plan
   is now for aggressive diuresis and then planned extubation later this
   week.
   # Respiratory failure
 continued substantial pulmonary edema with
   retrocardiac atelectasis.  NST 10 (low).
   - continue Vancomycin and Cefepime ([**10-6**]) for empiric Tx of HAP
   - continue aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt for goal of - 2 L/day
   titrate to BP.  Yesterday was -1.2 L: will continue lasix drip at 14
   cc/hr but add metolazone today to acheive diuresis goal.
   - continue chest PT with nebulizers
   - consult neurology for etiology of acute onset weakness
 may require
   NM consult; repeating NIF today.  Neuromuscular weakness, if present,
   could be secondary to deconditioning.
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient with continued fluid overload
   state s/p aggressive resuscitation for GIB, now receiving aggressive
   diuresis; is overall -6 L negative, however clinically appears
   overloaded and radiologically pulm edema looks improved.
   - continued diuresis
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   - TTE shows 2+ MR: would not tolerate afterload reduction given low
   BPs; would consider adding this on after diuresis
   #Hypernatremia - Na stable between 139-141 last few days.
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and treat hypernatremia with free water flushes PRN
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 1.7 (improving) from
   baseline 1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.  Renal
   failure seems to be resolving.
   -nonoliguric: making good urine about 125 cc/hr
   - continue lasix gtt and add metolazone today to acheive diuresis goal
   following [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and Cr
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  HCT very slow trend down likely secondary to blood draws;
   currently at 28.5.  GIB stable.
   - Check daily HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.  Likely result of Integrilin.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to defer argatroban unless clinical picture is more
   concerning for HIT
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   # CAD
 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Telemetry shows occasional pauses, EKG reveals non-specific ST changes;
   enzymes were stable.
   - continue statin and anti-platelet agents unless evidence of active
   GIB
   # Atrial Fibrillation
 patient currently in NSR, continue to hold
   anticoagulation in setting of recent GIB
   # Urine
 cultures pos. for MSSA on [**9-25**], continuing broad spectrum
   antibiotics which should cover the urine flora

   failure in the setting of acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with good diruesis and has been able to
   maintain a negative fluid balance thorugh to this morning.  We have
   reasonable optimism for capacity to wean in light of recent changes
   -Albuterol
   -PSV and wean to [**5-1**]
   -Continue negative fluid balance if possible but with contraction
   alkalosis and improved pulmonary mechanics have seen likely improvement
   in volume status
   2)Congestive Heart Failure-
   -Lasix gtt
   -Digoxin
   --Consider afterload reduction going forward and prior to extubation
   3)GI Bleed-
   -No evidence of recurrence and will continue to follow for signs of
   recurrence.
   4)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Will have to follow Cr. And limit diuresis for any obvious increase.

   78 yom with hx of CHF, AF s/p staged PCI for acute CHF admitted with
   GIB in setting of anticoagulation for stent placement, now massively
   fluid overloaded s/p resuscitation requiring ventilator support.  Plan
   is now for aggressive diuresis and then planned extubation later this
   week.
   # Respiratory failure
 continued substantial pulmonary edema with
   retrocardiac atelectasis.  NST 10 (low).
   - tx course of PNA complete, most recent sputum showed no growth
   - continue aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt for goal of - 2 L/day
   titrate to BP.  Yesterday was -1.2 L: will continue lasix drip at 14
   cc/hr but add metolazone today to acheive diuresis goal.
   - continue chest PT with nebulizers

 patient with continued fluid overload
   state s/p aggressive resuscitation for GIB, now receiving aggressive
   diuresis; is overall -6 L negative, however clinically appears
   overloaded and radiologically pulm edema looks improved.
   - continued diuresis
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   - TTE shows 2+ MR: would not tolerate afterload reduction given low
   BPs; would consider adding this on after diuresis
   #Hypernatremia - Na stable between 139-141 last few days.
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and treat hypernatremia with free water flushes PRN
   - reduce free water fluses from 150 q4 to q6 to reduce water intake
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 2.2(improving) from
   baseline 1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.  Renal
   failure seems to be resolving.   Worsening, likely due to  reduced
   diuresis.

   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  HCT very slow trend down likely secondary to blood draws;
   currently at 27.6.  GIB stable.
   - Check daily HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.  Likely result of Integrilin.

 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Telemetry shows occasional pauses, EKG reveals non-specific ST changes;

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement.
- The patient underwent staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is currently on antiplatelet agents for the stent.
- He is massively fluid overloaded and required ventilator support due to respiratory failure. The plan is to perform aggressive diuresis and then planned extubation later this week.
- The patient continues to show signs of pulmonary edema and retrocardiac atelectasis. His blood pressure is stable, and he is being given lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of -2 L/day. Metolazone will be added today to achieve the diuresis goal.
- Neurology does not recommend an electromyography (EMG) at this time.
- The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is slightly elevated, hemoglobin (Hb) level is within normal range, and platelet count is stable.
- The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine (Cr) level of 2.2 (improving from baseline 1.1). Digoxin is being used to optimize forward flow.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement. The patient is now massively fluid overloaded and requires ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have substantial pulmonary edema with retrocardiac atelectasis. He has completed treatment for pneumonia, and his recent sputum showed no growth. Aggressive diuresis is planned to achieve a negative fluid balance of -2 L/day, titrated to blood pressure. The patient will also continue with chest physiotherapy and nebulizers.

2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient remains fluid overloaded despite aggressive diuresis. However, there is improvement in pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. The patient will continue with diuretics, digoxin for improved contractility, and may consider adding metolazone to achieve diuresis goals. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows moderate mitral regurgitation, which would not tolerate afterload reduction due to low blood pressures.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are stable between 139-141 over the last few days. Follow-up labs will be ordered, and hypernatremia will be treated with free water flushes as needed. Water intake"

   failure.  He has had stability of GI bleed and has been able to
   tolerate his anti-platelet agents.
   1)Respiratory Failure-He has shown capacity to tolerate SBT x 3 hours
   today and has been able to move to negative fluid balance with lasix
   GTT in place. Have been treating for possible pneumonia.  He has had 9
   Kg decrease in weight from diuresis
   -ABX completed
   -Continue diruesis
   -Move to extubate today and will have family members present at time as
   patient does not want to be re-intubated
   -Will need to support post extubation
   -He does have NIF that is decreased
   2)GI Bleed-
   -No evidence of active bleeding at this time
   -Follow HCT
   3)CHF-
   -Lasix 14mg/hr-we do have evidence that patient needs optimization
   peri-extubation.  Will move to even fluid balance today given rise in
   creatinine and look to decrease/end Lasix gtt.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure in the setting of a significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has shown stability in the GI bleed and has tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for 3 hours today, resulting in a negative fluid balance with the use of lasix. The patient has also been treated for possible pneumonia. The weight loss of 9 kg is attributed to diuresis.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient has persistent respiratory failure despite efforts to wean him off mechanical ventilation.
   - He has been moved to a SBT and has tolerated it well, indicating potential improvement.
   - The plan is to extubate the patient today with family members present due to the patient's wish not to be re-intubated.
   - Post-extubation support will be required.

2. GI Bleed:
   - There is currently no evidence of active bleeding.
   - The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels should be monitored.

3. CHF:
   - The patient's fluid balance needs optimization prior to extubation.
   - Lasix at a rate of 14 mg/hr is being used, but the rise in creatinine suggests a need to decrease or end the lasix infusion.
   - Afterload reduction discussion should continue.

 .H/O GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   78 yom with hx of CHF, AF s/p staged PCI for acute CHF admitted with
   GIB in setting of anticoagulation for stent placement, now massively
   fluid overloaded s/p resuscitation requiring ventilator support.
   Decision was made yesterday for CMO.
   # Respiratory failure
 continued substantial pulmonary edema with
   retrocardiac atelectasis.  NST 10 (low).
   - tx course of PNA complete, most recent sputum showed no growth
   - continue aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt for goal of - 2 L/day
   titrate to BP.  Yesterday was -1.2 L: will continue lasix drip at 14
   cc/hr but add metolazone today to acheive diuresis goal.
   - continue chest PT with nebulizers
   - neurology doesn't recommend EMG at this time
   - reduce titrate pressure settings down, and attempt
   # Congestive Heart Failure
 patient with continued fluid overload
   state s/p aggressive resuscitation for GIB, now receiving aggressive
   diuresis; is overall -6 L negative, however clinically appears
   overloaded and radiologically pulm edema looks improved.
   - continued diuresis
   - continue digoxin for improved contractility (normal EF is 35%)
   - TTE shows 2+ MR: would not tolerate afterload reduction given low
   BPs; would consider adding this on after diuresis
   #Hypernatremia - Na stable between 139-141 last few days.
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and treat hypernatremia with free water flushes PRN
   - reduce free water fluses from 150 q4 to q6 to reduce water intake
   #Acute renal failure
 initially attributed to dye load from angiogram
   exacerbated by poor renal perfusion.  Cr now 2.2(improving) from
   baseline 1.1.  Attempting to optimize forward flow with digoxin.  Renal
   failure seems to be resolving.   Worsening, likely due to  reduced
   diuresis.
   -nonoliguric: making good urine about 125 cc/hr
   - continue lasix gtt and add metolazone today to acheive diuresis goal
   following [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and Cr
   # GIB
 patient initially presenting with GIB s/p anti-platelet agents
   s/p PCI.  HCT very slow trend down likely secondary to blood draws;
   currently at 27.6.  GIB stable.
   - Check daily HCT and coags with goal > 28
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will continue Plavix and ASA
   # Thrombocytopenia
 patient initially with acute drop in platelet
   levels in the setting of HIT Ig positive with low optical density (low
   risk).  Seratonin release assay pending.  Platelet count now stable and
   at baseline.  Likely result of Integrilin.
   - continue to hold all heparin products
   - continue to trend daily platelet levels
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   # CAD
 patient is s/p PCI and on anti-platelet agents for stent..
   Initial concern for bump of cardiac enzymes s/p self extubation.
   Telemetry shows occasional pauses, EKG reveals non-specific ST changes;
   enzymes were stable.
   - continue statin and anti-platelet agents unless evidence of active

   # Atrial Fibrillation
 patient currently in NSR, continue to hold

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of anticoagulation for stent placement and is now massively fluid overloaded after resuscitation requiring ventilator support. 

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have substantial pulmonary edema with retrocardiac atelectasis. The treatment plan includes continuing aggressive diuresis with Lasix, titrating to blood pressure, adding metolazone, using nebulizers for chest PT, and reducing ventilator pressure settings.

2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has continued fluid overload despite aggressive diuresis. The treatment plan includes continued diuresis, using digoxin for improved contractility, and considering adding afterload reduction if diuresis goals are met.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are stable between 139-141. The plan is to follow hospital guidelines for electrolyte management and treat hypernatremia with free water flushes as needed.

4. Acute Renal Failure: Initially attributed to dye load from angiogram, exacerbated by poor renal perfusion. The creatinine level has improved from baseline 1.1 to 2.2. The plan is to optimize forward flow with digox"
