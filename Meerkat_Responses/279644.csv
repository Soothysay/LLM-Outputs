   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Currently recieving 2 units of PRBC for low hct of 21, target to
   greater than 30.
   - After duriesis BP decreased from 120/80 to the 80/48 in the setting
   of increased fentanyl (50->75) and versed(3->4) (held lasix, gave
   PRBC), need to diuresis when blood pressure permits.  Pressure improved
   after reducing fentanyl and versed to prior levels.   Was not able to
   meet diuresis goal last night, received lasix in the AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with no significant PMHx but a strong family hx of CAD
   initially presented with chest pain and SOB, with likely subacute
   NSTEMI.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has evidence of coronary artery disease and
   likely had an NSTEMI within the last one to two days.  This may have
   been provoked by possible community acquired pneumonia or infiltrates
   on CXR and CTA may be only pulmonary edema.  Regardless, the patient is
   being medically managed for her diffuse three vessel CAD.  The patient
   had 2 BMS placed in her RCA.  The rest of her CAD could not be
   intervened upon.  Integrillin was on board for 18 hours
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, restart heparin after arterial sheath is pulled
   - Continue statin
   - Beta blockers as tolerated once out of acute decompenstated event
   - Will need TTE in 3 months
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has preserved systolic function on TTE today,
   however cath shows evidence of biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   The patient is volume overloaded on exam and hemodynamics demonstrate
   overload as well.  attempted to diuresis overnight but BP did not
   tolerate.
   - Lasix boluses PRN
   - Goal negative 1-2 liters
   - If cannot tolerate lasix boluses, will start lasix drip
   - Monitor PA pressures and titrate to wedge approx [**12-26**]
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient is NSR.  Will start beta blockers following
   acute stage.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # anemia: patient had an acute drop in her hct over the past couple of
   days, which is largely hemodilutional.  Though, may have an unknown
   source of bleed given guaiac negative. Likely will resolve once
   diuresis off.
   - need to trend hct after getting transfusion
   -will give lasix as BP is tolerated
   .
   #  Respiratory Distress:  Most likely secondary to volume overload in
   the setting of subacute NSTEMI and diastolic dysfunction.  However, the
   patient has other radiology findings which point towards
   consolidation.  Will continue to treat the patient for both CAP and
   pulmonary edema.  Flu negative, discontinued Tamiflu and ramanitidine
   - Maintain on ventilator as needed, will wean sedation in AM and
   attempt SBT
   - f/u sputum culture
   - continue ceftriaxone, azithro for CAP, narrow as possible
   - continue vanc empirically for MRSA and d/c if cxs neg x 48 hrs
   - Lasix boluses as above
   .
   # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Most likely was secondary to induction for
   intubation and sedation at OSH.  Monitor pressures closely.  Monitor
   cardiac index and SVR q4h.
   .
   FEN:  monitor/replete electrolytes, NPO for now

   ACCESS: R femoral, placed on [**2137-12-11**] at outside hospital, needs to be
   resited, Left sided femoral arterial and venous sheaths

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt once sheath pulled
   -Pain management with fentanyl
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with no significant personal medical history but a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She initially presented with chest pain and shortness of breath, likely experiencing a subacute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and had two bare-metal stents (BMS) placed in her right coronary artery (RCA). However, the rest of her CAD could not be intervened upon. The patient is currently being medically managed for her diffuse three-vessel CAD.

The patient has evidence of coronary artery disease and likely had an NSTEMI within the last one to two days, possibly provoked by possible community-acquired pneumonia or infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) that may be only pulmonary edema. 

The patient is in the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to volume overload in the setting of subacute NSTEMI and diastolic dysfunction. However, the patient also has other radiology findings which point towards consolidation, indicating possible pneumonia. The patient is being treated for both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and pulmonary edema.

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure that decreased further after increasing the doses of fentanyl and versed. The patient's heart rate and respiratory rate"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with no significant past medical history but a strong family history of coronary artery disease. She initially presented with chest pain and shortness of breath, likely subacute NSTEMI. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: The patient has evidence of coronary artery disease and likely had an NSTEMI within the last one to two days. This may have been provoked by possible community-acquired pneumonia or infiltrates on CXR and CTA may be only pulmonary edema. Regardless, the patient is being medically managed for her diffuse three-vessel CAD. The patient had two bare-metal stents placed in her RCA. The rest of her CAD could not be intervened upon. Integrilin was on board for 18 hours.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with an acute NSTEMI. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the proximal and distal RCA. Post-procedure, the patient developed multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and was admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or ischemic heart disease.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of subacute NSTEMI and diastolic dysfunction. Close monitoring and diuresis are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT level is low, indicating anemia. This may be due to blood loss during PCI or other causes. Close monitoring and transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) may be required.
4. Coagulation Disorders: The patient's elevated PT and PTT suggest coagulation disorders. Close monitoring of clotting parameters and appropriate management with anticoagulants or clotting factors may be necessary.
5. Infectious Complications: The patient is at risk for infections due to invasive lines and devices. Monitoring of vital signs and cultures is essential to identify any potential infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of no significant past medical history, but a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented with a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease (3VD). She underwent placement of two bare metal stents (BMS) in the proximal and distal branches of the right coronary artery (RCA). The rest of her CAD could not be intervened upon.

The patient has been hemodynamically stable, but has shown signs of volume overload. She has received diuretic therapy and has had 1.2 liters of fluid removed. An echocardiogram revealed preserved systolic function, but evidence of biventricular diastolic dysfunction. Blood pressure has been stable, and the patient will benefit from afterload reduction.

The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and will be monitored on telemetry. Her hemoglobin level is 25.4, and she has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) recently. There have been reported bloody secretions through nasogastric (NG) suctioning, but the source is unclear. It is possible that she may have an unknown source of bleeding, but this could resolve once diuretic therapy is stopped.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress, which is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of subacute NSTEMI and"

   the setting of increased afterload.
   - Continue diuresis
   - f/u sputum culture
   - continue ceftriaxone, azithro for CAP.  Add Flagyl for anaerobic
   coverage.
   - Start Nitro gtt to improve BPs, then consider extubation.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of CAD and recent NSTEMI.
- She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in proximal and distal RCA.
- The patient has diffuse 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and captopril.
- She has been experiencing respiratory distress due to volume overload, possibly exacerbated by subacute NSTEMI and diastolic dysfunction.
- The patient has been diuresed significantly since admission, with a negative fluid balance.
- She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
- She has been febrile with a temperature of 101.6°F and has been prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and endotracheal tube secretions culture have been ordered.
- There is a concern for flash pulmonary edema due to increased afterload.
- The patient's anemia is being managed with red blood cell transfusions.
- Her electrolytes will be monitored and repleted as necessary.
- The patient has a history of bloody secretions through NG suctioning, which may be related to an unknown source of bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia:"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - unable to tolerate extubation, 220 systolic BP when not sedated.
   - was given propafol as patient is not being extubated tonight(plan to
   turn off propafol at 7am and try to extubate on rounds - consider
   extubate on [**6-18**] bipap).
   - I/O check -1.2 liter negative, gave IV 80mg Lasix, repleted her
   lytes, PM hct is stable.  At 6am, given another IV 80mg of Lasix, as
   UOP was trailing off.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of no significant past medical history but a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stents (BMS) in the proximal and distal right coronary artery (RCA). She also has diffuse 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) that could not be intervened upon.

The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. The main concerns and potential medical complications mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has diffuse 3-vessel CAD, which is a significant risk factor for future cardiac events. The placement of BMS in the RCA may help improve blood flow but does not completely eliminate the risk of further complications.

2. Fluid overload: The patient is described as having volume overload, with a negative fluid balance and ongoing diuresis. This could be due to her underlying cardiac dysfunction and may increase the risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of subacute NSTEMI and diastolic dysfunction. There is a concern for flash pulmonary edema, especially when the patient's blood pressure increases significantly during agitation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of no significant past medical history but a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and has known diffuse 3-vessel CAD. The patient underwent placement of two bare metal stents (BMS) in the proximal and distal branches of the right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient's current condition indicates that she is hemodynamically stable but has been experiencing respiratory distress. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and is sedated. The respiratory support parameters show a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 90, positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Plateau) of 19 cmH2O, and an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 160 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -7 mEq/L, and oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 400 mmHg. Her venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is at 75%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no chest wall deformities or accessory muscle use. However, there are bilateral anterior rales and expiratory wheezes. The patient also exhibits 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Other findings include a supple neck with jugular venous distention (JVD) to the level of the mandible, a palpable precordium with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, thrills, lifts, or S3 or S4 heart sounds. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly (HSM), tenderness, or abdominal aorta enlargement. There are arterial and venous sheaths in place on the left. The skin is intact without stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas. Pulses are present in all extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.9 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 27.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 239 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 27 mmHg, blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of no significant past medical history but a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and has known diffuse 3-vessel CAD. She underwent placement of bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal and distal right coronary arteries (RCA). The rest of her CAD could not be intervened upon.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of respiratory distress and agitation. She was intubated initially but was extubated recently. She is currently experiencing post-tussive emesis, which is causing episodes of hypertension. Nebulizers and Zofran have been used to manage these symptoms.

Her chest X-ray shows improved pulmonary edema. She is receiving various medications including nitroprusside, furosemide, hydralazine, metoprolol, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate 87 bpm, blood pressure 119/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. Her laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as a slightly low hemoglobin level.

The patient has been diuresed significantly since admission, and her fluid balance shows a negative"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and a previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease and underwent placement of bare-metal stents in the proximal and distal branches of the right coronary artery.

The patient has been extubated, but unable to swallow oral medications due to the presence of a nasogastric (NG) tube. She has been receiving intravenous (IV) medications, including hydralazine and metoprolol for blood pressure control, as well as nitroprusside for acute management of hypertension.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of no significant past medical history but a strong family history of coronary artery disease. She has had a previous non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and known diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stents in the proximal and distal right coronary arteries. The rest of her coronary artery disease could not be intervened upon.

The patient's current condition includes being hemodynamically stable with diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease, elevated cardiac enzymes, and evidence of biventricular diastolic dysfunction. She is close to euvolemic and has preserved systolic function. Her blood pressure is stable, and she is benefiting from afterload reduction.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of subacute NSTEMI and diastolic dysfunction. She has diuresed significantly since admission and now appears close to euvolemic. Her blood pressure increases significantly when she is agitated, raising concern for flash pulmonary edema in the setting of increased afterload.

The patient is currently on captopril and labetalol for blood pressure control, with plans to switch to oral lisinopril (10) and continue labetalol. She is also on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and Flagyl for community-acquired pneumonia/aspiration"

She presented with symptoms consistent with NSTEMI and has known diffuse 3-vessel coronary artery disease. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with placement of bare metal stents in the proximal and distal RCA. Due to the presence of diastolic dysfunction, the patient is experiencing hypertension and respiratory distress, which appears to be secondary to volume overload.

The patient's neurological status has improved overnight, but she experienced apneic spells while sleeping.

The patient is receiving various medications including metoprolol, heparin sodium, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and metronidazole. She is also on labetalol, captopril, and hydralazine for blood pressure control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with no significant past medical history but a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and known diffuse three-vessel CAD. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of two bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal and distal right coronary arteries (RCA). She also has incomplete revascularization for the rest of her CAD.

The patient's condition has been hemodynamically stable, with peaked creatine kinase (CK) levels at 314 on [**12-11**]. She has been receiving eptifibatide for 18 hours and is currently on aspirin (ASA) 325mg, clopidogrel (Plavix) 75mg, and atorvastatin 80mg.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: The patient had an NSTEMI and diffuse three-vessel CAD. She underwent PCI with BMS placement in the proximal and distal RCA. The rest of her CAD could not be intervened upon.
2. Pump: The patient appears to be close to euvolemic after diuresis of 1.3 L yesterday. Echocardiogram shows preserved systolic function, but catheterization indicates biventricular diastolic dysfunction. Blood pressure has been stable, and the patient will"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease and previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has undergone stenting in the proximal and distal branches of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient presented with symptoms consistent with an acute coronary syndrome and was found to have diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 135/83 mmHg to 100/46 mmHg, heart rate between 61 and 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 12 and 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is somnolent but alert, with normal heart sounds and no murmurs. She has bibasilar rales on lung auscultation but otherwise clear to auscultation. Her abdomen is mildly distended with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves and no appreciable asymmetrical neurologic deficits.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Kidney function is within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels. Cardiac markers such as troponin-T and CK-MB are elevated, indicating myocardial damage.

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. She presented with diffuse 3-vessel coronary artery disease and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of bare-metal stents in the proximal and distal branches of the right coronary artery. The patient also completed 18 hours of eptifibatide treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable with blood pressure ranging from 135/83 mmHg to 95/46 mmHg, heart rate between 61-88 bpm, respiratory rate at 12-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is currently on captopril and labetalol for blood pressure control and will be switched to lisinopril. The patient is also on ASA 325 mg, Plavix 75 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg.

Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and electrolytes. However, her creatinine level is elevated at 1.7 mg/dL. The cardiac enzymes CK, CK-MB, and troponin-T are within normal limits.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, who presented with symptoms of a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease and has undergone placement of bare-metal stents in the proximal and distal right coronary arteries. The patient's condition has been stable, with peak creatine kinase (CK) levels at 314 on [**12-11**].

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 119/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient is somnolent and has an altered level of consciousness (AAOx1.5).

The patient has been extubated and is unable to swallow oral medications due to the presence of a nasogastric (NG) tube. She has been receiving intravenous (IV) fluids and medications, including hydralazine and metoprolol for blood pressure control.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild bibasilar rales in the lungs, regular rate and rhythm with no appreciable jugular venous distension, and well-perfused extremities. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves II-XII and no appreciable asymmetrical neurologic deficits"
