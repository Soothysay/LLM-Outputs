","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and acute exacerbation of COPD. Upon admission, she had an oxygen saturation of 80-90% on 6L NC and face tent, and her urine output was poor. She was started on Lasix but had to stop due to poor urine output and borderline hypotension. The patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI after a conversation with the patient using a Russian interpreter. Her daughter, who is her healthcare proxy, was called but has not yet returned the call.

The patient underwent a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement due to rising WBC count and worsening BUN/creatinine. Despite this, her urine output continued to be poor, and her creatinine levels were rising. She received fluids for poor urine output and responded well. However, her FE urea was 15%. She was also put back on BIPAP overnight.

The patient has a known allergy to no medications. She was last given antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) on 02/02/22 at 02:02 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF). She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was found to have an obstructing stone in the mid to upper right ureter, causing hydronephrosis. She also has a right adrenal nodule, most likely an adenoma. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) secondary to the obstructing stone. The patient's oxygen saturation has been fluctuating between 80-90% on 6L NC and face tent. Her urine output has been poor, and she has been given Lasix boluses and a fluid bolus, which responded well. She has a change in code status to do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient's baseline oxygen saturation is low, indicating respiratory distress. This could be due to her underlying COPD and the acute exacerbation caused by fluid overload, untreated OSA, and diastolic heart failure.
2. UTI/Pyelonephritis: The presence of an obstructing stone and dirty urine culture suggests a possible UTI, which may progress to py"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), and hypothyroidism. She presented to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure and fluid overload. The patient's current condition includes oxygen saturation of 91% on BiPAP, poor urine output, rising creatinine levels, and a Proteus mirabilis infection in the urine culture. She has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube and administration of Lasix, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. The patient has been on BiPAP for respiratory support and is currently on DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels and poor urine output indicate a potential AKI, which could be due to the obstructing stone causing urinary tract obstruction and infection.
2. Pulmonary Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD and OSA, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of diastolic CHF and current fluid overload state increase the risk of cardiac complications like heart failure exacerbation or"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, fluid overload, and worsening COPD. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including hypotension, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute kidney injury (AKI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings as low as 94 systolic. This can be concerning and may require further investigation and management.
2. UTI: The patient has shown signs of a urinary tract infection, with a dirty urinalysis and a high colony count of Proteus mirabilis. This infection needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. AKI: The patient's kidney function has been declining, as indicated by rising creatinine levels. This may be due to obstructive uropathy caused by kidney stones. Nephrology consultation and further evaluation are necessary.
4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD appears to be worsening, as evidenced by increased respiratory distress and abnormal arterial blood gas (ABG) values. Close monitoring and optimization of respiratory support are required.
5. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure seems to be acute"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient also has a history of untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The patient's recent events include non-invasive ventilation, which was started and stopped multiple times, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation. The patient's leukocytosis is expected due to infection. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pansensitive proteus mirabilis. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/41 to 124/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on non-rebreather mask with BiPAP support. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, clear mental status, difficulty auscultating heart sounds due to vocal noises, scattered ronchi/crackles in the lungs, and erythema of lower"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, acute exacerbation of COPD, hypercarbic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive pyelonephritis, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and subsequent intubation.

The patient has a history of kidney stones, for which a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by interventional radiology (IR). She also has an unresolved urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pansensitive Proteus Mirabilis. The patient's creatinine levels have stabilized at 3.6 over the last 24 hours, and her respiratory status has been stable with the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and BiPAP.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/41 mmHg to 124/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on NIV. Her lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 13.3 to 18.4 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly abnormal electrolyte levels.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   Her renal function and respiratory status are not showing any
   convincing signs of improvement. Goals of care will likely need to be
   readdressed soon. CMO is most appropriate in light of her multiple,
   severe, end-stage conditions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation intermittently and occasionally pulls off the mask, resulting in low oxygen saturation levels. She has been given various medications including morphine for pain and dyspnea, as well as antibiotics for a urinary tract infection caused by pansensitive Proteus mirabilis.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/41 mmHg to 124/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels between 2.7 and 3.6 mg/dL, and potassium levels between 3.6 and 4.2 mEq/L.

The patient's conditions include nephrolithiasis, chronic renal failure, COPD with acute exacerbation, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and diastolic CHF. The plan includes completing a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin for the urinary tract infection, monitoring the functioning of the nephrostomy tube,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, acute exacerbation of COPD, hypercarbic respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and has undergone a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement by interventional radiology (IR). The patient also has an ongoing urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pansensitive Proteus Mirabilis. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by a stabilized creatinine level of 3.6 over the last 24 hours. Diuretics have been withheld due to concerns about worsening renal function. The patient's fluid balance shows an ongoing positive balance, indicating fluid overload. 

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by hypercarbic respiratory acidosis due to COPD and untreated OSA. The patient has been using non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with BiPAP, but intermittently pulls off the mask, leading to low oxygen saturation levels in the 80s. 

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is being rate-controlled with digoxin and lopressor.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis and has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, fluid overload, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and acute on chronic dCHF. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation, with intermittent use of BiPAP and occasional removal of the mask leading to low oxygen saturation levels. She is receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, morphine sulfate for pain and dyspnea, and antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pansensitive proteus mirabilis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and other abnormal lab results indicating potential complications such as acute exacerbation of COPD, acute kidney injury, and diastolic CHF. The patient's current plan includes continuing nephrostomy tube, holding diuretics, encouraging oral intake, and closely monitoring urine output and weight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing respiratory distress. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of worsening respiratory function and potential"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypercarbic respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). The patient was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, fluid overload, COPD, untreated OSA, and diastolic failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, and chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, COPD, and untreated OSA. These conditions can lead to respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has acute on chronic diastolic CHF. This can lead to pulmonary edema, worsening heart failure symptoms, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has chronic renal failure and nephrolithiasis. There is a risk of worsening renal function, acute kidney injury, and potential sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection.
4. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can progress to pyelonephritis. There is a risk of bacteremia and sepsis.

The patient has leukocytosis, which is expected due to the current management. The urology recommendation is to continue with the nephrostomy tube and follow up with urology as an outpatient. The patient has received 250ml of normal saline with little effect on urine output. Low-dose morphine has been given for pain and dyspnea. The patient is intermittently on BiPAP, occasionally pulling off and dropping saturation levels to the low 80s.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 02/22/2141 at 08:00 AM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/23/2141 at 02:20 AM. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and morphine sulfate. Other medications are also being administered.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and more. The patient's oxygen delivery device is a non-rebreather mask, and the ventilator mode is CPAP/PSV. The tidal volume (Vt) is 320-594 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypercarbic respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), acute-on-chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypothyroidism.
- The patient was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory acidosis, likely due to a combination of factors such as fluid overload, COPD, untreated OSA, and diastolic failure. The patient is reluctant to participate with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and often pulls off the mask.
- The patient is significantly fluid overloaded and shows signs of increased pulmonary congestion with crackles in the posterior lung fields.
- There is evidence of hypotension, which may be due to infection or kidney stones. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) while awaiting urine culture results.
- The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pyelonephritis, likely secondary to an obstructing kidney stone. The urine analysis is dirty, and the patient is being covered with antibiotics until further cultures can be obtained.
- The patient's baseline creatinine level is 2-2.5, and on admission, it was 2.1. Renal function is expected to worsen due to acute"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and also had hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pansensitive Proteus mirabilis, for which she received antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nephrolithiasis/UTI: The patient has a history of kidney stones and UTI. There is a potential risk of recurrence or worsening of the UTI due to the presence of the nephrostomy tube.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of creatinine levels and fluid balance is necessary.
3. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient's heart failure may worsen, especially with the presence of pulmonary edema. Holding diuretics poses a risk of fluid overload.
4. Hypercarbic Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's COPD and untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) contribute to elevated carbon dioxide levels. Improper adjustment of BIPAP settings can lead to respiratory complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: Rate control may be challenging due to the patient's renal dysfunction."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis and also presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including nephrolithiasis/UTI, acute on chronic renal failure, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypercarbic respiratory acidosis, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She is currently receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nephrolithiasis/UTI: The patient has a history of kidney stones and a urinary tract infection caused by pansensitive proteus mirabilis. If left untreated or not properly managed, this can lead to further kidney complications.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to multiple factors such as hypotension, UTI/obstructive nephropathy, congestive heart failure, and severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with poor cardiac output. If not managed appropriately, this can result in worsening renal function and potentially progress to end-stage renal disease.
3. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic heart failure may worsen if diuretics are not"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and a recent episode of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). She was admitted to the ICU with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis and developed a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pansensitive proteus mirabilis. The patient underwent right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement and is currently showing improvement with good urine output via the nephro tube and decreasing white blood cell count.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely multifactorial, including hypotension on admission, UTI/obstructive nephropathy, congestive heart failure, and severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with poor cardiac output. Her creatinine levels have stabilized at 3.5-3.6 over the last 24 hours, and diuretics have been withheld due to renal failure.

The patient also has acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with cor pulmonale and severe right ventricular dysfunction. This is further complicated by long-standing untreated OSA and COPD. Diuretics have been held due to renal failure, and there will be a tenuous balance given severe dCHF, pulmonary edema, and poor renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is a Russian speaking male who is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is an altered mental status, which is not due to delirium. He has a history of chronic renal failure, kidney stones, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation but it was stopped. He is receiving multiple medications including lasix and IV fluids, as well as antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, but his oxygen saturation is low at 89%. The patient has erythema of the lower extremities with chronic venous stasis dermatitis and trace pitting edema. His labs show elevated creatinine levels and abnormal kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 89%, indicating potential respiratory distress or failure.
2. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. The presence of COPD and low oxygen saturation increases the risk of respiratory infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has signs of chronic venous stasis and erythema of the lower extremities, which may indicate a risk for developing DVT.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and abnormal kidney function indicate ongoing renal impairment.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and kidney stones. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been receiving various antibiotics since admission. His vital signs show a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/48 mmHg to 127/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates an infusion of 1,220 mL of fluids since midnight, with a total output of 706 mL of urine and 460 mL of blood products. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels, slightly low potassium, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. The physical examination is mostly not assessed due to the patient's altered mental status. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI and disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation of 89% and ABG results indicating respiratory acidosis suggest potential respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and the administration of various antibiotics indicate a possible infection. Continuous assessment for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchitis. The patient was admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation due to an acute exacerbation of COPD. 

Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels of 3.1 mg/dL. This could lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and difficulty in eliminating waste products from the body.
2. Acute Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's current admission to the ICU is for an acute exacerbation of COPD. This can result in respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation levels, and increased work of breathing.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient presents with altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as medication side effects, hypoxia, or sepsis. This can impair the patient's ability to communicate and make decisions.
4. Venous Insufficiency: The patient has erythema of the lower extremities with chronic venous stasis dermatitis, indicating possible chronic venous insufficiency. This can lead to complications like edema, ulceration, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
5. Medication Allergies: The patient has no"

She also has chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with cor pulmonale, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

24-hour events include non-invasive ventilation stop, continued holding of lasix and IVF, improvement in creatinine levels to 3.1, and the administration of various antibiotics.

Physical examination findings include an obese neck, difficulty auscultating heart sounds over vocal noises, regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur, scattered ronchi/crackles in the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, erythema of lower extremities with chronic venous stasis dermatitis, and trace pitting edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), with decreased sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), bicarbonate (HCO3), and calcium (Ca). Glucose levels are within normal range.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including hypercarbic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal failure, and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis.

The patient's current status includes:
- Altered mental status
- Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)
- Renal failure, chronic (chronic kidney disease)
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation
- Hypercarbic respiratory failure

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient has COPD and OSA, which can lead to hypercarbic respiratory failure. If not properly managed, this condition can progress and result in further respiratory compromise.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised due to chronic renal failure. Any additional insults, such as medication errors or inadequate fluid management, could lead to acute kidney injury.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has diastolic CHF and a history of untreated OSA, which increases the risk of cardiac events. Close monitoring and management of the patient's cardiac status are essential to prevent complications like heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), acute on chronic heart failure (CHF), nephrolithiasis, chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and a history of untreated OSA. She is currently admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis and has been placed on non-invasive ventilation. The patient's creatinine level has improved to 3.1. She has a known allergy to no medications and has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. The patient is receiving multiple IV medications, including morphine sulfate. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nephrolithiasis/UTI: The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis and was previously treated with a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube. She has a UTI caused by pansensitive Proteus Mirabilis. The plan is to continue ciprofloxacin for a 14-day course and follow up with urology to determine the long-term plan for managing the nephrolithiasis. Proper functioning of the nephrostomy tube should be monitored.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), acute on chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic renal failure, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis and had a urinary tract infection (UTI) from admission with pansensitive Proteus mirabilis. The patient underwent right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement by interventional radiology (IR) and is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin to complete a 14-day course.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient's baseline pCO2 appears to be in the 70s, likely due to untreated OSA and diastolic failure. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if not managed properly.
2. Chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, which may worsen if not managed appropriately. Holding diuretics and closely monitoring creatinine levels are important in managing this condition.
3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has acute on chronic diastolic CHF with severe right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Continuous monitoring of daily weight and urine output is crucial. Holding diuretics is necessary due to renal failure, but careful balance is required given severe dCHF and pulmonary edema.

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including diastolic heart failure, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and a history of atrial fibrillation. She is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, likely related to poor respiratory status. The patient also has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney stones, hypothyroidism, and is on various medications including digoxin, aspirin, and levothyroxine.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/51 to 127/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 85% on bipap. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 at 100%, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, and SpO2 at 85%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high creatinine level, and slightly elevated blood glucose level. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes using bipap as needed, diuresis as needed, continuous nebulizer treatments, and ongoing monitoring. The patient is also on medications for atrial fibrillation, including digoxin and aspirin, as well as levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxia. She has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions including altered mental status, chronic renal failure, COPD with acute exacerbation, hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, nephrolithiasis, and hypothyroidism.

The patient has responded well to BiPAP and saline nasal spray. She is currently on multiple medications including morphine sulfate, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and others. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/56 to 164/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 77%.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, and normal creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's imaging studies are pending. She has a history of UTI caused by proteus mirabilis and has undergone right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. Her urine output has been good via the nephro tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and there is a concern for acute exacerbation due to factors such as hypotension, UTI, and obstructive nephropathy. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxia. She has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. She was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis and acute on chronic heart failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments including BiPAP, antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin), pain medication (Morphine), sedatives (Lorazepam), and anticoagulants (Heparin). Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 139/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 77%. The patient's physical examination reveals altered mental status, crackles in the chest, and positive extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. Imaging studies and microbiology reports are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and the presence of crackles in the chest suggest a potential respiratory failure. This could be due to her underlying COPD or acute exacerbation of the condition.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and her recent creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. It is essential to monitor her kidney function closely and adjust medication"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis. The patient has been on bipap overnight and is showing improvement in oxygenation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 122/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds throughout, crackles in the chest, warm and cyanotic skin, and oriented mental status. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and impaired kidney function. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, morphine sulfate, and diuretics. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, exacerbation of COPD, respiratory acidosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of chronic conditions including chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with right flank pain due to nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been on bipap while sleeping, which helps improve oxygenation. She also has atrial fibrillation, rate-controlled with digoxin. Other medical conditions include hypothyroidism and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, which may be due to hypotension on admission, urinary tract infection (UTI), obstructive nephropathy, or congestive heart failure.
2. Nephrolithiasis/UTI: The patient has a history of kidney stones and a UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis. A percutaneous nephrostomy tube has been placed to alleviate obstruction and improve urine flow.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF-Cor pulmonale: The patient has evidence of severe right ventricular dysfunction and cor pulmonale, likely due to long-standing untreated OSA and COPD.
4. Hypercarbic respiratory acidosis: The patient's high baseline pCO2 levels indicate a chronic respiratory problem, likely"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   80F w/ persistent hypercarbic and hypoxemic resp failure due to a
   variety of factors including COPD, OSA, diastolic CHF admitted with
   nephrolithiasis w/ subsequent placement of nephrostomy tube.  Pt had
   been improving back toward baseline.  Team had Russian translator in
   after rounds to assess symptoms and communicate plan.  Pt per report
   from translator was feeling fine and felt at baseline at that
   point
though it should be emphasized she is at tenuous respiratory
   status even at baseline.  She was wearing facemask and tolerating mask
   ventilation at night with varied success.
   As documented in event note, patient had cardiovascular arrest post
   transfer from chair to bed.  Pacer continued to fire but patient was
   noted to be pulseless and apneic.  Pt was DNR so no resuscitation was
   performed.  Pt
s family was notified and autopsy offered.  A variety of
   etiologies possible for arrest including massive pulmonary embolus
   (though on anticoagulation), massive myocardial infarction, or massive
   stroke.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple health conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), acute on chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic renal failure, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with right flank pain due to kidney stones and had a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed. The patient had been improving but experienced a cardiovascular arrest post-transfer from a chair to bed. Despite being do not resuscitate (DNR), no resuscitation efforts were made. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a need for careful management of fluid balance and medication dosing.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient has evidence of volume overload and poor cardiac output, requiring close monitoring and treatment.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory acidosis: The patient's baseline pCO2 levels are elevated, likely due to untreated OSA and COPD. Management includes using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BIPAP) while sleeping.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is controlled with medication, but adjustments may be needed due to renal dysfunction.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient's respiratory status requires ongoing management, including oxygen therapy and bronchodilators.
6. Nephrolithiasis: The patient has kidney stones,"
