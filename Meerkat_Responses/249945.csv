   if he developed progressive respiratory failure.
   - Continue supplemental O2 for now.
   - Per primary Oncology team, would like to consider bronchoscopy to

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes, currently undergoing XRT with Cisplatin. He presents with neutropenic fever, hypoxia, and a large right lower lobe pneumonia with right upper lobe extension. The patient has pancytopenia due to CLL marrow infiltration and has received Rituxan/Vincristine but experienced rigors, fevers, desaturation, and difficulty in controlling symptoms. The infusion was stopped, but restarted later and tolerated well. The patient is also receiving antibiotics and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status, characterized by rhonchi throughout lung fields, increased oxygen requirements during febrile episodes, and labored breathing, indicates a high risk for respiratory failure. Immediate interventions such as incentive spirometry, coughing, deep breathing exercises, and bronchodilator nebulizations have been implemented to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever, high fever spikes, and decreased WBC count suggest a possible sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered, but further investigation is needed through sputum and stool cultures to identify the causative organism. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any deterioration.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure ("

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 61 y/o male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to
   regional lymph nodes currently receiving XRT with Cisplatin presents
   with neutropenic fever and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia/tachypnea - unclear whether this is related to Rituxan
   infusion vs. worsening of pneumonia despite broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Despite extensive discussion with patient regarding code
   status, patient did not want to say whether he wanted intubation or not
   if he developed progressive respiratory failure.
   - Continue supplemental O2 for now.
   - Per primary Oncology team, would like to consider bronchoscopy to
   elucidate other organism not covered by antibiotics.  However, this
   would require intubation and will require discussion with patient,
   primary oncology team, and patient's wife to clarify code status.
   .
   # Neutropenic fevers - Has large RLL pneumonia with RUL extension.
   Continues to have fevers, rigors and wbc count decreased. ID consulted
   on [**7-22**]. Changed from cefepime/vanc/flagyl to
   meropenem/vanc/voriconazole [**2170-7-22**]. Sputum sample completed. On
   Neupogen. several serologic studies sent.
   .
   # Hypotension: fluid responsive. Lowest SBP 78. Running maintenance
   fluids, but probably losing more with high fevers. Off triam-hctz.
   .
   ## Pancytopenia/CLL - bone marrow bx shows marrow infiltration by CLL.
   Attempted Rituxan/Vincristine on [**7-21**] but pt
   rigors/fevers/desat--difficult to control. CTA demonstrated no PE, but
   large pneumonia. Received the vincristine, but [**12-23**] of the Rituxan
   infusion and then this was stopped and not restarted over the weekend.
   On 3L of oxygen. On [**7-23**] restarted rituxan infusion and tolerating
   well.
   .
   # Anemia: blood transfusion ordered, but pt with continued high fevers
   so will plan to transfuse once fevers are controlled
   .
   # Tylenol/Alcohol: history of significant daily alcohol use and
   requiring tylenol for fever control. Will alternate with Ibuprofen, but
   put on [**Hospital1 **] PPI for stomach protection given thrombocytopenia. Daily
   LFTs during acute period. Currently no evidence of hepatitis.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes currently receiving XRT with Cisplatin. He presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening rhonchi throughout lung fields, increased oxygen requirements during febrile episodes, and an increased respiratory rate. This indicates possible acute respiratory failure, which may progress to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Monitoring respiratory status closely and encouraging incentive spirometry use, coughing, and deep breathing techniques are recommended.

2. Infection: The patient has a neutropenic fever and large right lower lobe pneumonia with right upper lobe extension. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition remains unstable. Consideration for bronchoscopy to identify other organisms not covered by antibiotics should be discussed with the primary oncology team and the patient's wife to clarify code status.

3. Hypotension: The patient has shown episodes of hypotension, which may be due to fluid loss caused by high fevers. Fluid responsiveness has been observed, and maintenance fluids are being administered. Discontinuation of triam-hctz is recommended.

4. Pancytopenia/CLL: The patient has marrow infiltration by CLL, resulting in pancytopenia. Blood transfusion is ordered but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes, relapsing CLL, presenting with neutropenic fever and hypoxia. The patient has been receiving radiation therapy and cisplatin. He is currently in the ICU due to worsening pneumonia despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and is experiencing tachypnea and difficulty taking deep breaths. The patient's blood counts are low, indicating pancytopenia. He is also experiencing rigors, fevers, and low oxygen saturation levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further interventions are being planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea may progress to respiratory failure if not adequately managed. Continuous supplemental oxygen and respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever and low white blood cell count suggest an increased risk of infection and sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of infections are crucial.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of a large right lower lobe infiltrate indicates pneumonia. Failure to respond to antibiotics or worsening of symptoms may suggest a resistant infection or complications such as abscess formation.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not appropriately managed. Blood transfusions may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include fever, hypoxemia, pancytopenia, and pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing significant fever with neutropenia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern about bronchospasm, and the decision to perform a bronch has been delayed due to the risk of intubation. The patient's blood counts are stable but remains pancytopenic, and there is no immediate need for transfusion.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 104.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/64 to 129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress, overweight, no pallor or scleral icterus, normal heart sounds with no murmurs, and no peripheral edema. The respiratory system examination shows coarse crackles that partly clear with cough at the right base. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show 1+ edema, and the skin is warm with papular, erythematous rash on the back. Neurologic examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (H"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and neutropenic fever. The patient presented with hypoxia and an infiltrate in the right lower lobe (RLL) of the lung, following a bronchoscopy procedure.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a maximum temperature of 103.6°F (39.8°C), tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 95-134 beats per minute, and hypotension with blood pressure readings between 91/54-142/79 mmHg. The respiratory rate is elevated at 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 93% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count below 0.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The kidney function tests indicate a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and the electrolyte levels show potassium at 3.8 mEq/L, calcium at 7.5 mg/dL, magnesium at 1.6 mg/dL, and phosphorus at 1.6 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values reveal respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.51, hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200, and hypercapnia with a CO2 level of 39 mmHg.

The patient's chest X-ray shows an evolving left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate, and the ABG values suggest worsening respiratory distress. The presence of fever spikes, tachypnea, desaturation, and evolving infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or sepsis secondary to the underlying malignancies.

In summary, the patient's current condition suggests possible medical complications including severe sepsis or septic shock due to neutropenic fever, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and potential complications related to mechanical ventilation. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these issues promptly and appropriately."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch yesterday.
   1) Hypoxia/ tachypnea: exacerbated during and after fever spikes.
   Likely due to RLL pna. Bronch yesterday may have transiently worsened
   the symptoms with some washing fluids left over from it.
   - continue O2 supp, abx, neb treatments
   - start mucomyst with albuterol (monitor for any signs of bronchial
   spasms)
   - check urinary legionella antigen
   - Suspicion for PE is low given pt
s low plts, however, will check
   LENIs.
   - f/u bronchial fluid labs
   2) Neutropenic fevers: Pt has a source of fever (RLL pna), however, pt
   has been on broad spectrum abx for 5 days. Anti-viral added yesterday
   for empiric coverage. Fevers may be related to medications. Will peel
   off unecessary abx once organism is identified and sensitivity studies
   are completed.
   - f/u sputum, blood, BAL studies
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
   - continue Neupogen
   - appreciate ID recs
   3) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
   - Give IVIG x 1 given pt
s h/o hyperglobulinemia
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   4) H/o hypotension: fluid responsive. Has had stable, normal BPs in
   last 48 hours, although pt appears to be highly sensitive to Verapamil
   - Continue Verapamil at
 previous dose
   - continue to monitor, fluid boluses as necessary as pt likely has
   increased insensible loss during fever spikes.
   5) Anemia
 hct stable.
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile.
   6) Tylenol/Alcohol: h/o significant daily alcohol use and requiring
   tylenol for fever control. Pt and pt
s wife do not want NSAIDs for the
   risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Will d/c motrin
   order.  Will monitor LFTs- currently no e/o hepatitis.
   7) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   8) thrush
   - continue clotrimazole troches
   9) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic; consider adding ensure as
   pt has very little appetite right now. Also consider Megace
   10) Access
   - Piv
   11) PPX
   - pneumoboots, encourage ambulation, on PPI, neutropenic precautions
   12) [**Name (NI) 224**] Pt and pt

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an ICU admitted, neutropenic fever and pneumonia patient. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday and was tachypneic with desaturation. The patient required increasing amounts of oxygen overnight and was placed on 100% O2 via a facemask. A chest X-ray at midnight showed an evolving left lower lobe infiltrate. ABG results indicated hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Nebulizers were given, and the patient appeared more comfortable in the morning with improved breathing.

The patient also experienced frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) during periods of tachycardia. An EKG was performed, revealing no new changes. The patient's electrolytes were checked and repleted as necessary. The patient continues to have fevers, and acyclovir was added to the treatment regimen per ID recommendations.

Medications:
- Azithromycin was administered on [**2170-7-25**] at 12:19 PM.
- Voriconazole was given on [**2170-7-25**] at 10:00 PM.
- Meropenem was started on [**2170-7-26**] at 12:00 AM.
- Acyclovir was initiated on [**2170-7-26**] at 04:00 AM.
- Vancomycin was given on [**2170-7-26**] at 05:21 AM.

Infusions:
- Midazolam (Versed) was started on [**2170-7-25**] at 03:14 PM.
- Fentanyl was administered on [**2170-7-25**] at 04:14 PM.
- Pantoprazole (Protonix) was given on [**2170-7-26**] at 12:00 AM.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms.

Flow Sheet Data:
- Vital signs: The patient's maximum temperature was 103.6°F (39.8°C), current temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), heart rate is 118 bpm with a range of 95-134 bpm, blood pressure ranges from 60-142 mmHg, respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute with a range of 20-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has received a total of 3,598 mL of fluids since midnight, with 2,758 mL given intravenously.
- Fluid balance: The patient has a net intake of 1,698 mL and a loss of 274 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,424 mL.
- Blood products: A total of 1,900 mL of blood products have been transfused, with 700 mL remaining outstanding.
- Urine output: The patient has produced 1,900 mL of urine since midnight, with 700 mL remaining outstanding.
- NG output: The patient has produced 1,698 mL of NG output.
- Respiratory support: The patient is receiving high-flow nebulization therapy, with an SpO2 of 93% and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200.

Physical Examination:
- Peripheral vascular examination: The patient's radial and digital pulses were not assessed.
- Skin examination: Not assessed.
- Neurologic examination: The patient responded appropriately but various aspects such as movement, tone, and assessment were not evaluated.

Labs/Radiology:
The patient's lab results include:
- White blood cell count: 0.3 K/uL (low)
- Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL (low)
- Platelet count: 150 mg/dL (low)
- Sodium: 137 mEq/L (normal)
- Potassium: 3.6 mEq/L (normal)
- Chloride: 102 mEq/L (high)
- Bicarbonate: 23.8 (normal)
- Blood urea nitrogen: 39 mg/dL (high)
- Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL (normal)
- Glucose: 170 mg/dL (high)

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with evidence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The evolving left lower lobe infiltrate seen on chest X-ray suggests a possible pneumonia, which may worsen the patient's respiratory condition.

2. Infectious Complications: The patient's neutropenic fever and pneumonia indicate an underlying infection. The addition of acyclovir to the treatment regimen suggests concern for a viral infection as well. Further evaluation is needed to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and frequent PACs may indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction. The EKG shows no new changes, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess for any worsening cardiac status.

4. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level indicates possible renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to assess for any further deterioration.

5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's use"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual presenting with pneumonia, respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and pancytopenia. The patient's temperature has been elevated, reaching 103.6 degrees Fahrenheit during the night with accompanying tachycardia and tachypnea. Increased oxygen requirements necessitated the use of a closed-face mask. A chest X-ray revealed a possible new left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2 of 70 mmHg on a 40% mask.

The patient has been administered broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir for prophylaxis due to prolonged neutropenia. Fever has persisted, with a spike last night potentially attributed to bronchoscopy. The patient's respiratory support consists of high-flow nebulization with an oxygen delivery device, maintaining SpO2 levels at 97%.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, not in acute distress, and exhibits normal heart sounds despite some obscurity due to breath sounds. The patient's extremities show trace edema, and no cyanosis or clubbing is present. Neurological assessment indicates attentiveness, ability to follow simple commands, and response to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show low white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, and elevated levels of potassium (K+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include respiratory distress, pneumonia, hypoxemia, and pancytopenia. Fevers persist, and the patient continues on broad-spectrum antibiotics. No new culture results are available. A chest X-ray demonstrates improved expansion of the right lower lobe, suggesting clearing of the mucus plug. Oxygenation has slightly improved from the previous night.

Considering adding mucomyst to albuterol to facilitate secretion clearance. The possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) is being considered, and lung expansion exercises (LENI's) should be performed. Pneumoboots are recommended.

The patient's hematocrit (Hct) and platelet count are trending downwards, nearing the threshold for transfusion. ICU care includes oral feedings, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia Progression: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise or the development of complications such as abscess formation or sepsis.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low WBC and platelet counts increase the risk of infection and bleeding complications. Close monitoring of blood counts and appropriate management are crucial.
4. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, pancytopenia, and potential bacterial infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multiorgan dysfunction.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's pancytopenia and immobilization pose a risk for thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylaxis and appropriate monitoring are essential."

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] periods of increased work of breathing and
   hypoxia. Pt desatted to 88-89% on 4L NC, complained of SOB that was
   worse than before. Could hear gurgling due to mucus plugging that was
   not cleared by coughing. RR reached 40. Pt was placed on non-breather
   with return of O2 sat into the mid-90s and mild improvement of
   tachypnea. Performed chest PT, gave nebulizer treatments. CXR showed
   increased effusion.
   IVIG was started last night but discontinued after about 30 minutes due
   to hypoxia and tachypnea. Pt did not complain of back pain, rashes,
   flushing, and although pt had a low-grade fever it was unchanged from
   before. Although the suspicion for transfusion reaction was low, IVIG
   infusion was discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presents with neutropenic fever, hypoxia, and right lower lobe infiltrate. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days and an antiviral was added yesterday for empirical coverage. His fever may be related to medications, and unnecessary antibiotics will be discontinued once the organism is identified and sensitivity studies are completed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea are likely due to right lower lobe pneumonia. The chest X-ray shows developing pleural effusions versus segmental collapse of the right lower lobe.
- The patient appears volume overloaded, so gentle diuresis with a goal of -1L is recommended.
- Contact interventional pulmonology for possible thoracentesis. If concerned due to low platelets, transfuse.
- Consider repeat bronchoscopy.
- Continue oxygen supplementation, antibiotics, nebulizer treatments, and Mucomyst with albuterol (monitor for any signs of bronchial spasms).
- Follow-up urinary Legionella antigen.
- Suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE) is low given the patient's low platelets and preliminary negative lower extremity Doppler ultrasound (LENS).
- Follow-up bron"

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] periods of increased work of breathing and
   hypoxia. Pt desatted to 88-89% on 4L NC, complained of SOB that was
   worse than before. Could hear gurgling due to mucus plugging that was
   not cleared by coughing. RR reached 40. Pt was placed on non-breather
   with return of O2 sat into the mid-90s and mild improvement of
   tachypnea. Performed chest PT, gave nebulizer treatments. CXR showed
   increased effusion.
   IVIG was started last night but discontinued after about 30 minutes due
   to hypoxia and tachypnea. Pt did not complain of back pain, rashes,
   flushing, and although pt had a low-grade fever it was unchanged from
   before. Although the suspicion for transfusion reaction was low, IVIG
   infusion was discontinued.

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and neutropenic fever. The patient presented with hypoxia and was found to have right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL pneumonia). 

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for five days and an antiviral medication was added yesterday for empirical coverage. The fever may be related to medications. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/58 to 138/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate pancytopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 49 K/uL. Other lab values show elevated levels of creatinine, lactic acid, and liver enzymes, while albumin and calcium levels are low. 

Imaging results show no deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the bilateral lower extremities. 

The patient's medical plan includes continuing oxygen support, antibiotics, and nebulizer treatments. Mucomyst with albuterol has been started, and the urinary Legionella antigen will be checked. Bronch"

   of fluid balance of 1L negative; patient with increasing edema and
   positive fluid balance for the admission.

","The patient's chief complaint includes pneumonia, respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and pancytopenia. The patient has been experiencing variable oxygenation overnight, with increased respiratory distress and fever. They were placed on an NRB mask with improvement and received chest physiotherapy and nebulizers. A chest X-ray showed an increased pleural effusion, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was started, but the patient had another episode of tachypnea and dyspnea, so IVIG was stopped.

The patient's history includes allergies to pollen/hayfever and unknown medications. They were given azithromycin on 07/25/2170, acyclovir, meropenem, vancomycin, and voriconazole on 07/27/2170. The patient is also taking pantoprazole (Protonix), tessalon perles, allopurinol, neupogen, MVI, and thiamine.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.9°F), heart rate of 134 bpm, blood pressure of 129/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. 

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, mild respiratory distress, PERRL (pupils equal,"

   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-27**], the streak of
   atelectasis at
   the left base has cleared. The hazy opacification involving the lower
   portion
   of the right hemithorax persists. This is consistent with the right
   lower
   lobe consolidation seen on CT which has expanded to involve part of the
   right
   upper lobe. Moderate right and small left pleural effusion persists.
   Prominence of the right hilar region could reflect the lymphadenopathy
   seen on
   CT that probably represents a reactive process.

   11 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 5 for GN/anaerobes, Voriconazole Day [**4-23**]
   for empiric fungal), neb treatments, mucomyst with albuterol (monitor
   for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   - Will switch to Posaconazole from Voriconazole for possible allergic
   response (pt spikes fever after each dose of Vori)
   - Legionella Urinary ag negative.
   - Bronch AF culture still pending.
   2) Neutropenic fevers: Pt has a source of fever (RLL pna), however, pt
   has been on broad spectrum abx for 5 days. Acyclovir for empiric
   coverage (Day 4). Fevers may be related to medications. Will peel off
   unecessary abx once organism is identified and sensitivity studies are

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presented with neutropenic fever and hypoxia, found to have right lower lobe infiltrate, and underwent bronchial lavage. There is suspicion for pneumonia but no utility to re-bronch at this time. The patient's pleural fluid results are not diagnostic of exudate, and cultures are pending. He has been experiencing adverse reactions to IVIG and Voriconazole. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 103/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Physical examination shows rhonchi bilaterally, decreased breath sounds from mid to the base of the right lung, and 1+ pitting edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory findings indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal medication, nebulizer treatments, and mucolytics. Pleural effusion and pneumonia are suspected, and further cultures are pending. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of potential complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch [**2170-7-25**].
   1) Hypoxia/ tachypnea: exacerbated during and after fever spikes.
   Likely due to RLL pna. X ray now showing ?developing pleural effusions
   vs segmental collapse of RLL.
   - pt appears volume overloaded- gentle diuresis with goal of -1L
   - Contact interventional pulmonology for possible tap. If concerned due
   to low plts, transfuse.
   - CT chest to eval interval change
   - Consider re-bronch
   - continue O2 supp, abx, neb treatments, mucomyst with albuterol
   (monitor for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   - f/u urinary legionella antigen
   - Suspicion for PE is low given pt
s low plts, and LENIs preliminarily
   neg for DVTs
   - f/u bronchial fluid labs
   2) Neutropenic fevers: Pt has a source of fever (RLL pna), however, pt
   has been on broad spectrum abx for 5 days. Anti-viral added yesterday
   for empiric coverage. Fevers may be related to medications. Will peel
   off unecessary abx once organism is identified and sensitivity studies
   are completed.
   - f/u sputum, blood, BAL studies
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
   - continue Neupogen
   - PO vanc d/c
d as pt is C. diff neg. (With new assay that lab is
   using, was told that neg result x 3 is no longer required to rule out
   C. diff)
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Re-try IVIG infusion today
   3) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
   -  IVIG attempted for hypogammaglobulinemia but discontinued due to
   ?transfusion reaction.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   4) Anemia
 hct stable.
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile.
   5) Tylenol/Alcohol: h/o significant daily alcohol use and requiring
   tylenol for fever control. Pt and pt
s wife do not want NSAIDs for the
   risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Will monitor LFTs-
   currently no e/o hepatitis.
   7) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   8) thrush
   - continue clotrimazole troches
   9) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic, with ensure. Also consider
   Megace
   10) Access
   - Piv, PICC
   11) PPX
   - pneumoboots (but pt refusing), encourage ambulation, on PPI,
   neutropenic precautions
   12) Code- DNR but does wish to be intubated, after which pt's wife
   [**Name (NI) 225**] will determine goal of care depending on prognosis for meaningful
   recovery

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previous chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presented with neutropenic fever and hypoxia, and was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate following bronchoscopy. The patient appears to be volume overloaded, so diuresis is being initiated with the goal of removing 1 liter of fluid. The patient's low platelet count may necessitate a platelet transfusion if an invasive procedure is needed. A CT chest is planned to evaluate any changes, and consideration is being given to repeating the bronchoscopy. The patient is on oxygen supplementation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, nebulized treatments, and Mucomyst with albuterol. There are concerns about bronchial spasms. Legionella antigen in the urine will be followed up, and bronchial fluid labs are pending.

The patient's neutropenic fevers are being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for five days, with the addition of antiviral coverage. The source of fever is believed to be the right lower lobe pneumonia. Once the organism is identified and sensitivity studies are completed, unnecessary antibiotics will be discontinued.

The patient has pancytopenia and CLL, and recently completed a course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]. IVIG was attempted for hypogammaglobulin"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), admitted to the ICU for fever and neutropenia. The patient's course has been complicated by progressive hypoxemic failure, pneumonia, sepsis, and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's vital signs are unstable with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and requires supplemental oxygen. The patient also has diarrhea and is being evaluated for possible Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and further investigations are being conducted, including imaging and microbiological tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his neutropenic state. It is important to continue the current antibiotics and monitor for any signs of infection.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require increased ventilatory support. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory function is necessary.

3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea needs to be managed appropriately, and further evaluation should be done to determine the underlying cause. If C. difficile infection is confirmed, appropriate treatment should be initiated.

4. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which may require drainage or other interventions. Monitoring of fluid accumulation"

   I agree in full with the history, exam, ROS and plan and findings of

   the plan of care and examination of the patient.  I would add that
   patient with SCCA now admitted with fever and substantial effusion.  He
   is now s/p thoracentesis with significant improvement in dyspnea but
   has persistent fever and neutropenia.  He has been limited with IVIG
   tolerance and has rigor following voriconazole.
   On exam
   RR=38
   Patient with clear evidence of consolidation in RLL region most
   prominently.  He does have subtle dullness to percussion only.  Cough
   with deep inspiration noted consistent with some re-expansion of
   atelectasis.
   Will have to continue to consider antibiotic choices with ID and
   Oncology input for long term intervention.  He has had improvement with
   thoracentesis which is encouraging at this time and will continue to
   wean O2 as tolerated.  Will need repeat CXR to evaluate for
   re-accumulation.   Given persistent tachypnea and quick rise in heart
   rate with minimal exertion would favor continued close monitoring given
   compromised respiratory status and likely slow to resolve pulmonary
   parenchymal process.

   Imaging: [**2170-7-28**] CXR
   In comparison with the study of [**7-27**], the streak of atelectasis at the
   left base has cleared. The hazy opacification involving the lower
   portion of the right hemithorax persists. This is consistent with the
   right lower lobe consolidation seen on CT which has expanded to involve
   part of the right upper lobe. Moderate right and small left pleural
   effusion persists. Prominence of the right hilar region could reflect
   the lymphadenopathy seen on CT that probably represents a reactive
   process.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch [**2170-7-25**], s/p thoracocentesis [**2170-7-27**].
   .
   1) Hypoxia/ tachypnea/fevers: hypoxia and tacypnea exacerbated during
   and after fever spikes. Fevers may be related to medications but also
   likely due to RLL pna, CXR this AM showing re-accumulation of pleural
   effusion on right.
   - Continue O2 supp, abx (Azithromycin Day 2 for atypicals, Vanc IV Day
   12 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 6 for GN/anaerobes, Posaconazole Day 2
   for fungal, Acyclovir Day 5 for viral), neb treatments, mucomyst with
   albuterol (monitor for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   - Continue Posaconazole.
   - Consider VRE coverage with Linezolid or Daptomycine (will d/w ID)
   - Pull out PICC as +erythema, consider re-placement of PICC at another
   site (pt has poor peripheral access)
   - Consider another trial of IVIG, since it
s uncertain whether pt had a
   true allergic reaction or fever/hypoxia coincided with IVIG infusion
   (will d/w ID and heme/onc)
   - Legionella Urinary ag negative.
   - F/u plueral fluid and BAL cultures
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
   - continue Neupogen
   2) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   3) Anemia
 hct stable.
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile.
   4) Tylenol/Alcohol: h/o significant daily alcohol use and requiring
   tylenol for fever control. Pt and pt
s wife do not want NSAIDs for the
   risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Will monitor LFTs-
   currently no e/o hepatitis.
   5) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   6) thrush
   - continue clotrimazole troches
   7) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic, with ensure. Also consider
   Megace
   - Pt still complaining of small amounts of diarrhea each day. C.Diff
   negative [**7-25**].  Will check Crypto, Viral cx per ID, and if negative give
   Immodium for relief.
   8) Access
   - PIV
   9) PPX
   - pneumoboots (but pt refusing), encourage ambulation, Pantoprazole IV,
   neutropenic precautions
   10) Code- DNR but does wish to be intubated, after which pt's wife
   [**Name (NI) 225**] will determine goal of care depending on prognosis for meaningful
   recovery
   11) Comm

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presents with neutropenic fever, hypoxia, and right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient has undergone bronchoscopic evaluation and thoracocentesis. His current medications include azithromycin, vancomycin, meropenem, posaconazole, and acyclovir. He also receives neb treatments, mucomyst with albuterol, and oxygen supplementation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and fever spikes. Imaging reveals right lower lobe consolidation, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. The patient's laboratory results indicate pancytopenia, anemia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's code status is DNR but wishes to be intubated, with the wife determining the goal of care based on prognosis for meaningful recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/tachypnea/fevers: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea worsen during and after fever spikes. This may be related to the right lower lobe pneumonia, as shown by the chest X-ray.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest pneumonia, specifically right lower lobe consolidation. This can lead to respiratory distress and sepsis if not"

   Imaging: [**2170-7-28**] CXR
   In comparison with the study of [**7-27**], the streak of atelectasis at the
   left base has cleared. The hazy opacification involving the lower
   portion of the right hemithorax persists. This is consistent with the
   right lower lobe consolidation seen on CT which has expanded to involve
   part of the right upper lobe. Moderate right and small left pleural
   effusion persists. Prominence of the right hilar region could reflect
   the lymphadenopathy seen on CT that probably represents a reactive
   process.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch [**2170-7-25**]. Suspicion for PE is low given
   pt
s low plts, and LENIs preliminarily neg for DVTs
   .
   1) Hypoxia/ tachypnea: exacerbated during and after fever spikes.
   Likely due to RLL pna. X ray now showing ?developing pleural effusions
   vs segmental collapse of RLL.
   - IP performed thoracentesis yesterday. Removed ~1L. Pt symptomatically
   better. Pleural fluid results not diagnostic of exudate. Pending
   pleural fluid culture.
   - CT chest yesterday showed
   - No utility to re-bronch at this time.
   - Continue O2 supp, abx (Azithromycin Day 1 for atypicals, Vanc IV Day
   11 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 5 for GN/anaerobes, Voriconazole Day [**4-23**]
   for empiric fungal), neb treatments, mucomyst with albuterol (monitor
   for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   - Will switch to Posaconazole from Voriconazole for possible allergic
   response (pt spikes fever after each dose of Vori)
   - Legionella Urinary ag negative.
   - Bronch AF culture still pending.
   2) Neutropenic fevers: Pt has a source of fever (RLL pna), however, pt
   has been on broad spectrum abx for 5 days. Acyclovir for empiric
   coverage (Day 4). Fevers may be related to medications. Will peel off
   unecessary abx once organism is identified and sensitivity studies are
   completed.
   - F/u blood cultures, Bronch AF culture
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
   - continue Neupogen
   - PO vanc d/c
d as pt is C. diff neg. (With new assay that lab is
   using, was told that neg result x 3 is no longer required to rule out
   C. diff)
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Hold off on additional IVIG given adverse reactions.
   3) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
   -  IVIG attempted for hypogammaglobulinemia but discontinued due to
   ?transfusion reaction.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   4) Anemia
 hct stable.
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile.
   5) Tylenol/Alcohol: h/o significant daily alcohol use and requiring
   tylenol for fever control. Pt and pt
s wife do not want NSAIDs for the
   risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Will monitor LFTs-
   currently no e/o hepatitis.
   7) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   8) thrush
   - continue clotrimazole troches
   9) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic, with ensure. Also consider
   Megace
   - Pt still complaining of small amounts of diarrhea each day. C.Diff
   negative [**7-25**].  Will check Crypto, Viral cx per ID, and if negative give
   Immodium for relief.
   10) Access
   - Piv, PICC

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia, and was found to have a right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and thoracentesis, with pleural fluid results not diagnostic of an exudate. A CT scan showed no utility to re-bronchialize and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently on multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Exacerbated during and after fever spikes, likely due to right lower lobe pneumonia. Developing pleural effusions or segmental collapse of the right lower lobe may be present.
2. Neutropenic Fevers: The patient has a source of fever (right lower lobe pneumonia), but has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for five days. Fevers may be related to medications. It is important to peel off unnecessary antibiotics once the organism is identified and sensitivity studies are completed.

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presented with neutropenic fever and hypoxia and was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and thoracocentesis.

The patient continues to experience hypoxia and tachypnea exacerbated during and after fever spikes. The fevers may be related to medications but are also likely due to the right lower lobe pneumonia, as confirmed by a chest X-ray showing re-accumulation of pleural effusion on the right side.

The patient is receiving oxygen supplementation, antibiotics (Azithromycin, Vancomycin, Meropenem), and antifungal medication (Posaconazole). Nebulization treatments and mucomyst with albuterol are being given, with monitoring for any signs of bronchial spasms.

Other ongoing treatments include consideration of VRE coverage with Linezolid or Daptomycin, pulling out the PICC line due to erythema and considering re-placement at another site, another trial of IVIG, and monitoring pleural fluid and BAL cultures.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and a history of locally advanced cutaneous SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) who has been admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and a large right lower lobe pneumonia. He also has bilateral pleural effusions, with the right side being tapped for 1 L on Friday.

The patient has been experiencing fever and respiratory distress. His vital signs show a temperature of 102.9°F, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and face tent.

The patient's physical examination reveals respiratory distress, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. His extremities are edematous, and he has an area of erythema around his PICC line. Neurologic assessment is not fully evaluated.

Laboratory results indicate neutropenia with a white blood cell count of 0.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39 K/uL. Other lab values include elevated lactate levels and elevated liver enzymes. Fluid analysis shows an ANC (absolute neutrophil count) of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of CLL and locally advanced cutaneous SCC, who was admitted with febrile neutropenia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and a large right lower lobe pneumonia. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The patient's WBC count has been slow to recover. He is experiencing respiratory distress, diarrhea, and has reaccumulation of a right pleural effusion. His blood pressures are borderline, and he has an area of erythema around his PICC line. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient's ongoing fevers and neutropenia indicate a potential risk for infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, but the patient's WBC count is still low, making him susceptible to further infections.

2. Volume overload: The patient is grossly edematous and has evidence of reaccumulation of pleural effusion. This suggests a possible volume overload situation, which may affect his cardiac function and respiratory status.

3. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing low-volume diarrhea. Infectious studies are pending, and if they are negative, the patient may be given medications such as lomotil or immodium to manage the symptoms.

4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is"

   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch [**2170-7-25**], s/p thoracocentesis [**2170-7-27**].
   .
   1) Hypoxia/ tachypnea/fevers: hypoxia and tacypnea exacerbated during
   and after fever spikes. Fevers may be related to medications but also
   likely due to RLL pna.
   - Continue O2 supp, abx (Azithromycin Day 3 for atypicals, Vanc IV Day
   13 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 7 for GN/anaerobes, Posaconazole Day 3
   for fungal, Acyclovir Day 6 for viral), neb treatments, mucomyst with
   albuterol (monitor for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   - Continue Posaconazole.
   - Consider VRE coverage with Linezolid or Daptomycine (will d/w ID)
   - Pull out PICC as +erythema, consider re-placement of PICC at another
   site (pt has poor peripheral access)
   - Consider another trial of IVIG, since it
s uncertain whether pt had a
   true allergic reaction or fever/hypoxia coincided with IVIG infusion
   (will d/w ID and heme/onc)
apparently on last trial of IVIG, patient
   had a Temp of 105.9F. Therefore, not continued.
   - Legionella Urinary ag negative.
   - F/u plueral fluid and BAL cultures
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
   - continue Neupogen
   2) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
   -          appreciate heme/onc recs
   3)  Coagulopathy:  INR of 3, most likely secondary to malnutrition.
   -give Vitamin K po
   -if PICC to be placed, will need FFP prior.
   3) Anemia
 hct stable.
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile and hct stable.
   4) Tylenol/Alcohol: h/o significant daily alcohol use and requiring
   tylenol for fever control. Pt and pt
s wife do not want NSAIDs for the
   risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Will monitor LFTs-
   currently no e/o hepatitis.
   5) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   6) thrush
   - continue clotrimazole troches
   7) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic, with ensure. Also consider
   Megace
   - goal: diurese to negative 1L
   8) Access
   - PIV, PICC pulled. Will speak to wife regarding replacement of PICC,
   vs continuing with PIVs
   9) PPX
   - intermittent pneumoboots, encourage ambulation, Pantoprazole IV,
   neutropenic precautions
   10) Code- DNR but does wish to be intubated short term, after which
   pt's wife [**Name (NI) 225**] will determine goal of care depending on prognosis for

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia, along with a right lower lobe infiltrate. He has undergone bronchoscopy and thoracocentesis. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, tachypnea, and fevers, which are likely related to the right lower lobe pneumonia. He has been receiving various antibiotics and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxia/tachypnea/fevers: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea may worsen during and after fever spikes. The fevers may be due to medications or the right lower lobe pneumonia.
- Continue oxygen supplementation, antibiotics (Azithromycin Day 3 for atypicals, Vanc IV Day 13 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 7 for GN/anaerobes, Posaconazole Day 3 for fungal, Acyclovir Day 6 for viral), nebulizer treatments, mucomyst with albuterol (monitor for bronchial spasms).
- Consider vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) coverage with Linezolid or Daptomycin.
- Pull out the problematic PICC line and consider replacing it at another site due to erythema."

1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea/Fever: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea may worsen during and after fever spikes. The re-accumulation of pleural effusion on the right side could contribute to these symptoms.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his compromised immune system. He is currently being treated with multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.
3. Pancytopenia/CLL: The patient's pancytopenia (low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) may be related to his CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). This increases his risk of infection and bleeding.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable hemoglobin levels, but may require transfusion in the future. His hct goal is above 24.
5. Alcohol/Tylenol: The patient has a history of significant daily alcohol use and requires Tylenol for fever control. There is a"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), neutropenia, and pneumonia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, which is multifactorial and includes pneumonia and pleural effusion. The patient has been experiencing fever, dyspnea, and scrotal and penile edema. He is receiving various medications including antibiotics, GM-CSF, and vitamin K. The patient's condition is critical, and he has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening or developing new infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged stay in the ICU.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has evidence of pleural effusion on imaging, which can lead to respiratory distress and further complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an unclear etiology of coagulopathy, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies or antibiotic use. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Neutropenia: The patient's neutropenia increases the risk of infections and delays wound healing. It requires close monitoring and management with appropriate precautions.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to marrow suppression from chemotherapy or chronic disease. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
6. Fluid Balance: The patient desires"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with respiratory distress. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including voriconazole, azithromycin, acyclovir, meropenem, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 103.8°F (39.9°C), tachycardia with a heart rate of 97 bpm, and hypotension with a blood pressure of 113/65 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the right lung field, and imaging shows a worsening right lower lobe infiltrate. Laboratory results indicate neutropenia with a white blood cell count of 0.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39 K/uL. The patient also has coagulopathy with an INR of 3.1, likely due to nutritional or antibiotic-related causes.

The patient's condition is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pleural effusion, and CLL. The patient has been placed on DNR (do not resuscitate) status, indicating that aggressive measures to prolong"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch [**2170-7-25**], s/p thoracocentesis [**2170-7-27**].
   1) Hypoxia/ tachypnea/fevers: hypoxia and tacypnea exacerbated during
   and after fever spikes. Fevers most likely due to RLL pna.
   - Continue O2 supp, abx (Azithromycin Day 4 for atypicals, Vanc IV Day
   14 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 8 for GN/anaerobes, Posaconazole Day 4
   for fungal, Acyclovir Day 7 for viral), neb treatments, mucomyst with
   albuterol (monitor for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   - Continue Posaconazole.
   - Consider VRE coverage with Linezolid or Daptomycine (will d/w ID)
   - Consider another trial of IVIG, since it
s uncertain whether pt had a
   true allergic reaction or fever/hypoxia coincided with IVIG infusion
   (will d/w ID and heme/onc)
apparently on last trial of IVIG, patient
   had a Temp of 105.9F. Therefore, not continued.
   - Legionella Urinary ag negative.
   - F/u plueral fluid and BAL cultures -Negative so far
   -Bronichal washings gram stain 1+ PMNs. Fungal culture grew yeast.
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
   - continue Neupogen
   2) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
   -          appreciate heme/onc recs
   3)  Coagulopathy:  INR of 3.1, most likely secondary to malnutrition.
   -give Vitamin K po
   #) Anemia
 hct stable.
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile and hct stable.
   4) Tylenol/Alcohol: h/o significant daily alcohol use and requiring
   tylenol for fever control. Pt and pt
s wife do not want NSAIDs for the
   risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Will monitor LFTs-
   currently no e/o hepatitis.
   -obtain AST, ALT, tbili today
   -slight rise yesterday: ALT 64, AST 51, tbili 3.2
   -continue to monitor
   5) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   6) thrush
   - continue clotrimazole troches
   7) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic, with ensure. Also consider
   Megace
   - goal: diurese to negative 1L
   8) Access
   - PIV, PICC pulled. Wife agreed that no PICC for now. But nursing is
   having difficulty with access. Will readdress this issue today.
   9) PPX
   - intermittent pneumoboots, encourage ambulation, Pantoprazole IV,
   neutropenic precautions
   10) Code- DNR but does wish to be intubated short term, after which
   pt's wife [**Name (NI) 225**] will determine goal of care depending on prognosis for
   meaningful recovery

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch [**2170-7-25**], s/p thoracocentesis [**2170-7-27**].
   1) Hypoxia/ tachypnea/fevers: hypoxia and tacypnea exacerbated during
   and after fever spikes. Fevers most likely due to RLL pna.
   - Continue O2 supp, abx (Azithromycin Day 4 for atypicals, Vanc IV Day
   14 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 8 for GN/anaerobes, Posaconazole Day 4
   for fungal, Acyclovir Day 7 for viral), neb treatments, mucomyst with
   albuterol (monitor for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   - Continue Posaconazole.
   -will speak to ID today regarding rising LFTs, which may be secondary
   to Posaconazole.  No abdominal pain currently.
   - Consider another trial of IVIG, since it
s uncertain whether pt had a
   true allergic reaction or fever/hypoxia coincided with IVIG infusion
   (will d/w ID and heme/onc)
apparently on last trial of IVIG, patient
   had a Temp of 105.9F. Therefore, not continued.
   - Legionella Urinary ag negative.
   - F/u plueral fluid and BAL cultures -Negative so far
   -Bronichal washings gram stain 1+ PMNs. Fungal culture grew yeast.
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
   - continue Neupogen
   2) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
   -          appreciate heme/onc recs
   3)  Coagulopathy:  INR of 3.1, most likely secondary to malnutrition.
   -give Vitamin K IV
   #) Anemia
 hct stable.
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile and hct stable.
   4) Tylenol/Alcohol: h/o significant daily alcohol use and requiring
   tylenol for fever control. Pt and pt
s wife do not want NSAIDs for the
   risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Will monitor LFTs-
   currently no e/o hepatitis.
   -obtain AST, ALT, tbili today
   -slight rise yesterday: ALT 64, AST 51, tbili 3.2
   -continue to monitor
   5) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   6) thrush
   - continue clotrimazole troches
   7) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic, with ensure. Also consider
   Megace
   - goal: diurese to negative 1L
   8) Access
   - PIV, PICC pulled. Wife agreed that no PICC for now. But nursing is
   having difficulty with access. Will readdress this issue today.
   9) PPX
   - intermittent pneumoboots, encourage ambulation, Pantoprazole IV,
   neutropenic precautions
   10) Code- DNR but does wish to be intubated short term, after which
   pt's wife [**Name (NI) 225**] will determine goal of care depending on prognosis for
   meaningful recovery

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previous chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia, and has been found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient has undergone bronchoscopy and thoracocentesis. He is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The patient also has pancytopenia due to CLL, coagulopathy, anemia, significant alcohol use, and a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. He is DNR but wishes to be intubated short-term.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/tachypnea/fevers: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea may worsen during and after fever spikes, which could be exacerbated by the right lower lobe pneumonia. Monitoring and continued oxygen support are necessary.

2. Rising liver function tests: The patient's liver function tests have been rising, which may be secondary to Posaconazole. This requires further evaluation by the ID team.

3. Pancytopenia/CLL: The patient completed a course of Rituxan and has pancytopenia due to CLL. This needs to be managed appropriately.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 3.1, likely secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia, and was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate. He underwent bronchoscopy and thoracocentesis. The patient's current conditions include right lower lobe pneumonia, pancytopenia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, coagulopathy, anemia, transaminitis, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, thrush, fecal occult blood, access issues, and do-not-resuscitate status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia: The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment for atypical organisms, gram-positive/methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative organisms/anearobes, fungal infection, and viral infection. Nebulizers and mucositis with albuterol will be continued to help with symptoms. There is concern regarding the loss of gag reflex, so a speech and swallow evaluation will be conducted.

2. Pancytopenia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia: The patient completed a course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]. Follow-up recommendations from the hematology/oncology department will be followed.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated IN"

- The patient presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia and has been found to have right lower lobe pneumonia.
- The patient underwent bronchoscopy and thoracocentesis.
- The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics (Azithromycin, Vancomycin, Meropenem) for atypical, gram-positive, and anaerobic infections, as well as antifungal (Voriconazole) and antiviral (Acyclovir) medications.
- The patient is also receiving nebulizer treatments and mucomyst with albuterol.
- The patient's gag reflex is concerning, and a speech and swallow evaluation is planned.
- There is uncertainty regarding the patient's allergic reaction to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), so another trial of IVIG is being considered.
- The patient's Legionella urinary antigen is negative, and the bronchial washings gram stain shows only 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), while the fungal culture grew yeast.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch [**2170-7-25**], s/p thoracocentesis [**2170-7-27**].
   1) Hypoxia/ tachypnea/fevers: hypoxia and tacypnea exacerbated during
   and after fever spikes. Fevers most likely due to RLL pna.
   - Continue O2 supp, abx (Azithromycin Day 4 for atypicals, Vanc IV Day
   14 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 8 for GN/anaerobes, Posaconazole Day 4
   for fungal, Acyclovir Day 7 for viral), neb treatments, mucomyst with
   albuterol (monitor for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   - Continue Posaconazole.
   -will speak to ID today regarding rising LFTs, which may be secondary
   to Posaconazole.  No abdominal pain currently.
   - Consider another trial of IVIG, since it
s uncertain whether pt had a
   true allergic reaction or fever/hypoxia coincided with IVIG infusion
   (will d/w ID and heme/onc)
apparently on last trial of IVIG, patient
   had a Temp of 105.9F. Therefore, not continued.
   - Legionella Urinary ag negative.
   - F/u plueral fluid and BAL cultures -Negative so far
   -Bronichal washings gram stain 1+ PMNs. Fungal culture grew yeast.
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
   - continue Neupogen
   2) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
   -          appreciate heme/onc recs
   3)  Coagulopathy:  INR of 3.1, most likely secondary to malnutrition.
   -give Vitamin K IV
   #) Anemia
 hct stable.
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile and hct stable.
   4) Tylenol/Alcohol: h/o significant daily alcohol use and requiring
   tylenol for fever control. Pt and pt
s wife do not want NSAIDs for the
   risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Will monitor LFTs-
   currently no e/o hepatitis.
   -obtain AST, ALT, tbili today
   -slight rise yesterday: ALT 64, AST 51, tbili 3.2
   -continue to monitor
   5) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   6) thrush
    - continue clotrimazole troches
   7) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic, with ensure. Also consider
   Megace
   - goal: diurese to negative 1L
   8) Access
   - PIV, PICC pulled. Wife agreed that no PICC for now. But nursing is
   having difficulty with access. Will readdress this issue today.
   9) PPX
   - intermittent pneumoboots, encourage ambulation, Pantoprazole IV,
   neutropenic precautions
   10) Code- DNR but does wish to be intubated short term, after which
   pt's wife [**Name (NI) 225**] will determine goal of care depending on prognosis for
   meaningful recovery
   11) Comm
 with pt and pt
s wife [**Name (NI) 225**]; also let PMD (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 228**]

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia, and has been found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate, following bronchoscopy and thoracocentesis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.2°F (39°C), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/68 mmHg to 90/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 66/73). Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and coagulation parameters are also provided.

The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics (Azithromycin, Vancomycin, Meropenem), antifungals (Posaconazole), and antivirals (Acyclovir). He is also receiving bronchodilators via nebulizers and mucomyst"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. They have been experiencing fever, occasional production of blood-streaked sputum, and a somewhat decreased gag reflex. The patient has a history of allergies to pollen/hayfever and is immunocompromised. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Azithromycin, Meropenem), antivirals (Acyclovir), antifungals (Voriconazole), and diuretics (Furosemide). The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/58 mmHg to 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.35 and PaCO2 of 35 mmHg. Physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs and no murmurs or irregularities in heart sounds. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has had multiple lines placed for fluid administration. The patient's condition is stable but remains critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, respiratory distress, and infiltrate on the chest radiograph suggest the possibility"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. They have a fever, occasional production of blood-streaked sputum, and a somewhat decreased gag reflex. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications. Their vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, suggestive of pneumonia. They also have neutropenia, hypokalemia, abnormal liver function tests, and a history of depression. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 1,424 mL, indicating fluid loss. They are being closely monitored in the ICU with various prophylactic measures in place, including stress ulcer prevention, deep vein thrombosis prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, neutropenia, and an infection (pneumonia) suggests a potential risk for sepsis. Prompt identification and management of sepsis are crucial.
3. Organ dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia) may indicate organ dysfunction. Monitoring liver enzymes and electrolyte levels is essential.

   61 yo male with cutaneous sq cell CA, previously on chemo and XRT, and
   relapsing CLL, presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia; found to
   have RLL infiltrate, s/p bronch [**2170-7-25**], s/p thoracocentesis [**2170-7-27**].
   1) RLL pneumonia
   - Continue O2 supp, abx (Azithromycin Day 5 for atypicals, Vanc IV Day
   15 for GP/MRSA, Meropenem Day 9 for GN/anaerobes, Voriconazole Day 1
   for fungal, Acyclovir Day 8 for viral), neb treatments, mucomyst with
   albuterol (monitor for any signs of bronchial spasms)
   -concern regarding loss of gag reflex. Will have speech and swallow
   eval.
   - Consider another trial of IVIG, since it
s uncertain whether pt had a
   true allergic reaction or fever/hypoxia coincided with IVIG infusion
   (will d/w ID and heme/onc)
apparently on last trial of IVIG, patient
   had a Temp of 105.9F. Therefore, not continued.
   - Legionella Urinary ag negative.
   -Bronichal washings gram stain 1+ PMNs. Fungal culture grew yeast.
   - continue chest PT, incentive spirometry
     - continue Neupogen
   2) Pancytopenia/CLL: Pt completed course of Rituxan on [**2170-7-23**]
    -          follow up with heme/onc recs
   3)  Coagulopathy:  INR of 3.1, most likely secondary to malnutrition.
   -repeat INR today
will give Vit K if high
   #) Anemia
 hct dropped from 27.5 to 22.9 over the last day. Concern
   with blood tinged sputum also.
   -repeat INR, CBC, type and screen
   - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile and hct stable.
   4) Transaminitis:
   -slight rise yesterday: ALT 64, AST 51, tbili 3.2
   -repeat LFTs today. Expect them to trend down given that posaconazole
   was d/c-ed yesterday
   5) cutaneous sq cell ca
   - XRT on hold
   6) thrush
    - continue clotrimazole troches
   7) FEN
   - cardiac, heart healthy diet, neutropenic, with ensure. Also consider
   Megace. Nutrition consult pending.
   -speech and swallow to eval gag reflex
   - goal: diurese to negative 1L. Will start 40 IV q12 hours
   8) Access
   - PIV, PICC pulled. Wife agreed that no PICC for now. But nursing is
   having difficulty with access. Will readdress this issue today.
   9) PPX
   - intermittent pneumoboots, encourage ambulation, Pantoprazole IV,
   neutropenic precautions

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presents with neutropenic fever, hypoxia, and right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient has undergone bronchoscopic treatment and thoracocentesis. He is currently experiencing fever, coughing up blood-tinged sputum, and difficulty with access for labs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest pneumonia. The antibiotics currently being administered should help treat the infection, but if the pneumonia worsens or does not respond to treatment, additional interventions such as bronchoscopy or other respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Pancytopenia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): The patient's low blood counts indicate pancytopenia, which can be a result of his CLL or recent chemotherapy treatment. Close monitoring of blood counts and following up with hematologic recommendations are important to manage this condition.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR suggests a coagulation disorder, likely secondary to malnutrition. Vitamin K administration and further evaluation are needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased over the past day, indicating anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels, repeating INR, and"

   samples.  Will consider pulmonary hemorrhage, and follow HCT once labs
   obtained this afternoon. Clinically stable.
    - hct goal>24, however will defer transfusion for now as pt continues
   to be febrile and hct stable.
   4) Transaminitis: Attributed to Posaconazole. Discontinued, and
   switched to Voriconazole 2 days ago. Will follow LFTs back to baseline.
   -slightly improved yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, previous chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He presents with neutropenic fever and hypoxia, as well as right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 103/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia: The patient has bronchial breath sounds on the right lung base and dullness to percussion, indicating a possible consolidation or effusion. This could lead to worsening respiratory distress or sepsis if not adequately treated.
2. Pancytopenia/CLL: The patient's low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets may increase the risk of infections, anemia, and bleeding complications.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR suggests a bleeding tendency, which may be secondary to malnutrition. Vitamin K supplementation has been given, but monitoring for signs of bleeding is essential.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly over the past day, raising concerns about blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. Blood tinged sputum also"
