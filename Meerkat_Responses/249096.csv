   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who is currently on decitabine (a chemotherapy medication) and presenting with explosive diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, and worsening anemia. 

The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration, resulting in the need for blood transfusions. The physical examination findings indicate mild anxiety, regular heart rhythm, clear lungs, stable abdomen, and no obvious signs of distress. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate ranging from 76 to 103 beats per minute, blood pressure between 122/56 mmHg and 137/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show low white blood cell count (WBC), low platelet count (Plt), low hematocrit (Hct), elevated creatinine (Cr), normal glucose levels, and abnormal coagulation parameters (PTT, INR). 

The assessment and plan indicate several medical complications that the patient is facing:

1. GI bleed: The patient has experienced maroon stools that gradually darkened over the course of the day. This suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped significantly, necessitating the transfusion of 5 units of blood and 1 unit of platelets. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned for today to further evaluate and manage the bleeding.

2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is likely related to the GI bleed, as there is no evidence of an infectious etiology at this time. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out. An EGD is also planned to investigate the cause of the diarrhea.

3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: These conditions are secondary to the patient's MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. The patient is advised to receive transfusions for hemoglobin levels below 21 g/dL and platelet counts below a certain threshold.

4. Neutropenia: The patient remains neutropenic, which may be a result of recent hospitalization for neutropenic fevers. Filgrastim, a medication that stimulates the production of neutrophils, is not recommended in the setting of MDS versus acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cefepime, an antibiotic, will continue to be administered as per bone marrow transplant recommendations.

5. Myelodysplastic Syndrome on decitabine: The patient has received chemotherapy with decitabine from April 25th to April 29th. Supportive treatment will be provided, and follow-up recommendations from the bone marrow transplant team will be considered.

6. HTN: The patient's hypertension medications are being held"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who is currently on decitabine and has been treated for neutropenic fevers. The patient presented with explosive diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, and worsening anemia. 

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. GI bleed: The patient experienced maroon stools that gradually darkened over the course of the day. There was a large drop in hematocrit (Hct) but no signs of hemodynamic compromise. As of May 17th, the patient required 5 units of blood and 1 unit of platelets. It is recommended to scope the patient (EGD) today, continue Pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion, and trend and transfuse Hct < 21 and platelets < 50.

2. Diarrhea: No evidence of infectious etiology at this time. The diarrhea is likely catharsis from the GI bleed. The patient will undergo an EGD today and follow-up stool culture.

3. Anemia/thrombocytopenia: The anemia and thrombocytopenia are secondary to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. The patient should be transfused for Hct < 21 and platelets < [Numeric Identifier 5736].

4. Neutropenia: The patient is still neutropenic (had been hospitalized recently for neutropenic fevers). There will be no filgrastim in the setting of MDS vs. AML. Cefepime will continue as treatment for neutropenic fevers per BMT recommendations; unspecified course at this time.

5. Myelodysplastic Syndrome on decitabine: The patient received C3 decitabine from April 25th to April 29th. Supportive treatment will be given, and follow-up with BMT recommendations.

6. HTN: Holding medications in the setting of GI bleeding.

7. FEN/GI: NPO (nothing by mouth) for now.

8. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

9. Code: Full code.

10. Disposition: Patient is pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Infection due to neutropenia
- Gastrointestinal bleeding leading to hypotension and shock
- Anemia leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
- Thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding
- Further deterioration of renal function
- Development of new infections due to immunosuppression
- Possible progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
- Pneumonia due to aspiration or immunosuppression
- Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and hypercoagulable state"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with explosive diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, and worsening anemia. He is currently on decitabine for his MDS and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a low hematocrit level and thrombocytopenia. He is at risk for further bleeding and requires supportive care including blood transfusions and platelet transfusions. The patient's diarrhea may be due to antibiotic-associated Clostridium difficile infection or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigations such as stool culture and bleeding scan may be necessary. The patient's neutropenia is persistent, and he will continue on empirical antimicrobials. His anemia is significant, and he will require transfusion with a target hematocrit of less than 21. His thrombocytopenia will also require supportive care with platelet transfusions. The patient's MDS treatment with decitabine will be continued. His blood pressure medications are being held due to the gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will receive nutritional support in the ICU. He is on systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, and elevation of head of bed for ventilator-associated pneumonia prophylaxis.

   85 yom MDS, neutropenia, now with explosive diarrhea, bright red blood
   per rectum and worsening anemia.
    on decitabine (last cycle of chemotherapy given [**Date range (1) 12727**]/10)
   currently  on antibiotics presenting with explosive diahhrea, bright
   red blood per rectum, and worsening anemia.
   GI BLEED
 Hematochezia.  no hemodynamic compromise.  Monitor stool
   output, serial exam, serial Hct.  Continue support with blood,
   platelets, iv fluids.  Transfuse to Hct >23.  Transfuse plts >50 if
   active bleeding.  GI Service to follow up re:  timing of EGD.
   DIARRHEA -- sudden onset.  Concern for C. diff (patient currently on
   antibiotics).  Possible due to blood as cathartic.  Check  stool for c.
   diff, culture.
   NEUTROPENIA -- persistent.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  No
   plans for GM-CSF.
   ANEMIA --  significant decrease in Hct to 18 from baseline 24.
   Attributed to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. Transfuse for Hct <
   23
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 attributed to MDS and chemotherapy.  Transfuse if
   <50k if active bleeding.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has been experiencing explosive diarrhea and bright red blood per rectum, indicating hematochezia. He is currently on antibiotics, which may increase the risk of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/49 mmHg to 137/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, and his cardiovascular and respiratory systems are normal. However, he has mild lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show a decreased hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, indicating anemia. The patient also has leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.6 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 37 K/uL. Other lab values, including creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring stool output and serial examination, as well as serial hematocrit (Hct) levels. He is to continue receiving blood transfusions to maintain Hct above 23%"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with symptoms of bloody diarrhea and a large ulcerated mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach. The patient has received 5 units of blood and 1 unit of platelets due to worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of a large ulcerated mass in the stomach suggests a high risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and organ failure.

2. Infection: The patient is neutropenic, indicating a compromised immune system. This increases the risk of infection, especially in the setting of an indwelling line. The patient is already on antibiotics for neutropenic fevers, but close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.

3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's ongoing blood loss and chemotherapy treatment may continue to contribute to anemia and thrombocytopenia. These conditions can lead to fatigue, difficulty in breathing, and increased bleeding tendencies, respectively.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may be due to volume depletion from NPO status. Close monitoring and correction of fluid balance is essential to prevent complications associated with hypernatremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with bloody diarrhea, maroon stools, and worsening anemia. He required 7 units of blood and 2 units of platelets. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a large ulcerated mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach, and a biopsy was taken. The patient is presumed to have a recurrence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. He will receive radiation therapy today for the presumed recurrence of MALT lymphoma, pre-treated with Zofran.

The patient also has diarrhea, which is likely catharsis from the gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) testing is negative. The patient's sodium levels are high, most likely due to volume depletion given his NPO status since admission. He will receive intravenous fluids (IVF) and have his electrolytes checked.

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia secondary to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. He will be transfused for hematocrit (Hct) < 21 and platelets < 50,000. The patient is still neutropenic, having been hospitalized recently for neutropenic fevers. Filgrastim will not be administered in the setting of MDS vs. acute myeloid leukemia (AML"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with bloody diarrhea and a large ulcerated mass in the stomach, which is presumed to be a recurrence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The patient received radiation therapy and has been transfused with red blood cells and platelets. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are secondary to MDS, chemotherapy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is still neutropenic and will continue to be treated with cefepime. Decitabine therapy for MDS will be continued. The patient's hypertension medication is being held due to the GI bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's initial presentation of bloody diarrhea and maroon stools suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to hypovolemia and shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which may require further transfusion support. Severe anemia can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if there are any additional procedures or infections. It may require platelet transfusion to maintain adequate clotting function.
4. Neutropenia: The patient's neutrophil count is below normal,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with bloody diarrhea and a large ulcerated mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach, which is presumed to be a recurrence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The patient has received radiation therapy for the lymphoma and has been transfused with red blood cells and platelets due to anemia and thrombocytopenia. He also has neutropenia and is being treated with cefepime for neutropenic fevers. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his respiratory support is via a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation at 100%. He has received pantoprazole infusions and is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient has already experienced significant GI bleeding, which has led to anemia requiring blood transfusions. Continued bleeding could result in further deterioration of his hemodynamic status.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, putting him at risk for bleeding complications, especially if he experiences any trauma or invasive procedures.
3. Neutropenia: The patient is still neutropenic, making him susceptible to infections. Continued neutropenia can increase the risk of recurrent or new infections.
4. MALT Lymphoma Recurrence: Although the patient has received radiation therapy, there is a possibility"

   85 yom MDS, neutropenia, now with explosive diarrhea, bright red blood
   per rectum and worsening anemia.
   GI BLEED
 Source identified as gastric tumor, likely recurreance of
   MALToma.  No hemodynamic compromise.  Monitor stool output, serial
   exam, serial Hct.  Continue support with blood, platelets, iv fluids.
   Transfuse to Hct >23.  Transfuse plts >50 if active bleeding.  If
   rebleeds, plan IR intervention for possible embolization.  Gen Surgery
   also following.
   DIARRHEA -- Resolved.  Possible due to blood as cathartic.  Check
   stool for c. diff, culture.
   NEUTROPENIA -- persistent.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  No
   plans for GM-CSF.
   ANEMIA --  significant decrease in Hct to 18 from baseline 24.
   Attributed to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. Transfuse for Hct <
   23
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 attributed to MDS and chemotherapy.  Transfuse if
   <50k if active bleeding.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) who presented with GI bleed. The source of bleeding was identified as a gastric tumor, likely a recurrence of MALToma. The patient is currently stable hemodynamically but requires close monitoring of stool output, serial exams, and serial Hct (hematocrit) levels. Blood and platelet transfusions will be continued to maintain adequate blood counts. If there are further rebleeds, the plan is for IR intervention to perform embolization. 

The patient also has diarrhea, which has resolved, and will be evaluated for possible C. diff infection. Neutropenia persists and will continue to be managed with empirical antimicrobials. The patient's significant anemia is attributed to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. Blood transfusion will be given for Hct < 23. Thrombocytopenia is also present due to MDS and chemotherapy, and platelet transfusion will be considered if the platelet count is <50k in the presence of active bleeding. 

The patient's MDS will be managed with decitabine therapy, and nutritional support will be provided once the patient is evaluated. Fluid balance will be monitored, and ICU care will include glycemic control, line care, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

   85 yom MDS, neutropenia, now with GI bleed
 attributed to gastric
   mass.
   GI BLEED
 Source identified as gastric tumor, likely recurreance of
   MALToma.  No hemodynamic compromise.  Monitor stool output, serial
   exam, serial Hct.  Continue support with blood, platelets, iv fluids.
   Transfuse to Hct >23.  Transfuse plts >50 if active bleeding.  If
   rebleeds, plan IR intervention for possible embolization.  Gen Surgery
   also following.
   DIARRHEA -- Resolved.  Possible due to blood as cathartic.  Check
   stool for c. diff, culture.
   NEUTROPENIA -- persistent.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  No
   plans for GM-CSF.
   ANEMIA --  significant decrease in Hct = 18 (baseline Hct= 24).
   Attributed to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. Transfuse for Hct <
   23
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 attributed to MDS and chemotherapy.  Transfuse if
   <50k if active bleeding.
   MDS
 Continue decitabine.  Received C3 decitabine from [**2146-4-25**] -
   [**2146-4-29**].  Continue treat supportively.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), neutropenia, and a recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed attributed to a gastric mass, likely a recurrence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has received transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 137/49 mmHg, heart rate of 57 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is sedated but responds to verbal stimuli, and his neurological examination is otherwise unremarkable.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 65 K/uL, and platelet count of 37 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently around 128-138 mg/dL.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion, dexamethasome, and decitabine for MDS treatment. He is NPO pending evaluation, and his nutritional support will be assessed further.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who is currently on decitabine, a chemotherapy treatment. The patient presented with explosive diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, and worsening anemia. 

The assessment and plan include several medical conditions and their respective treatments:

1. GI bleed: The patient had maroon stools that gradually darkened over the course of the day. He required 7 units of blood and 2 units of platelets. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a large ulcerated mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach, and a biopsy was taken. It is presumed to be a recurrence of MALT lymphoma. The plan is to continue XRT for the presumed recurrence of MALT lymphoma, pre-treat with Zofran and aquaphor ointment, follow up with path reports, switch gtt to protonix, and monitor for any further episodes of bleeding.

2. Diarrhea: There is no evidence of an infectious etiology at this time. It is likely catharsis from the GI bleed. The patient had a negative C. diff test, and no enteric gram-negative rods were found. Salmonella or Shigella were not detected, but Campylobacter is pending. The plan is to continue monitoring and follow up with stool cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with explosive diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, and worsening anemia. The patient required 7 units of blood and 2 units of platelets. An endoscopy showed a large ulcerated mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach, which is presumed to be a recurrence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The patient has been started on external beam radiation therapy (XRT) for presumed recurrence of MALT lymphoma, pre-treated with Zofran and aquaphor ointment.

The patient has had no further episodes of diarrhea since May 17th. Stool cultures have been negative for C. difficile, Salmonella, and Shigella, and Campylobacter is pending. The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to volume depletion given his NPO status since admission and has improved with intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are secondary to MDS, chemotherapy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He will be transfused for hematocrit (Hct) less than 21 and platelet count less than 50.

The patient is still neutropenic and will not receive filgrastim in the setting of MDS versus acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cefepime will be continued as treatment for neut"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with explosive diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, and worsening anemia. He has been treated with antibiotics and received chemotherapy with decitabine. The patient required 7 units of blood and 2 units of platelets due to a large drop in hemoglobin but showed no signs of hemodynamic compromise. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a large ulcerated mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach, and a biopsy was taken, suggesting a recurrence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The patient will receive a second dose of external beam radiation therapy (XRT) today for the presumed recurrence of MALT lymphoma, pre-treated with Zofran and aquaphor ointment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient had maroon stools that gradually darkened over the course of the day, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to hypotension and signs of hemodynamic compromise if not managed properly.
2. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia is secondary to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. Thrombocytopenia is also present, which increases the risk of bleeding and bruising.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yom MDS, neutropenia, now with GI bleed
 attributed to gastric
   mass.
   GI BLEED
 Source identified as gastric tumor, likely recurreance of
   MALToma.  No hemodynamic compromise.  Monitor stool output, serial
   exam, serial Hct.  Continue support with blood, platelets, iv fluids.
   Transfuse to Hct >23.  Transfuse plts >50 if active bleeding.  If
   rebleeds, plan IR intervention for possible embolization.  Gen Surgery
   also following.
   DIARRHEA -- Resolved.  Possible due to blood as cathartic.  Check
   stool for c. diff, culture.
   NEUTROPENIA -- persistent.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  No
   plans for GM-CSF.
   ANEMIA --  significant decrease in Hct = 18 (baseline Hct= 24).
   Attributed to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. Transfuse for Hct <
   23
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 attributed to MDS and chemotherapy.  Transfuse if
   <50k if active bleeding.
   MDS
 Continue decitabine.  Received C3 decitabine from [**2146-4-25**] -
   [**2146-4-29**].  Continue treat supportively.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending evaluation.
   FLUIDS
 monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and neutropenia, presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.
- The source of the bleeding is identified as a gastric tumor, likely a recurrence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALToma).
- The patient is stable hemodynamically and is being monitored with serial exams and Hct measurements.
- Supportive care includes blood transfusions to maintain Hct above 23 and platelet transfusions if active bleeding occurs.
- There are plans for interventional radiology (IR) intervention if rebleeding occurs.
- The patient's diarrhea has resolved, and stool cultures are being checked for Clostridium difficile.
- Neutropenia persists, and empirical antimicrobials are continued. No plans for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are mentioned.
- The patient has significant anemia, attributed to MDS, chemotherapy, and GI bleeding. Transfusion for Hct below 23 is planned.
- Thrombocytopenia is also attributed to MDS and chemotherapy, and platelet transfusion is indicated if below 50k with active bleeding.
- Decitabine treatment for MDS continues, and nutritional support is pending evaluation. Fluid balance is being monitored.
- Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (P"
