   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI presents
   with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   - FFP with goal INR < 1.8
   - 2 U PRBCs on arrival for Hct < 21, goal > 24
   - active T&S, has PICC for access
   -will send DAH workup including [**Last Name (LF) 6766**], [**First Name3 (LF) 1205**], ANCA
   - f/u BAL culture, blood cx
   - monitor oxygenation with appropriate ventilator support
   - serial Hct and coags
   - vitamin K 5 mg Po X 1 more dose
   -per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach consider CT neck to f/u
   fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not stabilize after
   correction of coags
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   .
   # Respiratory failure: The patient continues to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility. Post-bronch she will have full ventilator
   support with AC though airways were quite collapsable. Pressure support
   may be feasible goal later today though currently will have a/c post
   bronch.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - once transfused, careful attention to fluid status
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and uptitration of lasix at rehab as creatinine has trended
   up over the past week per their records. Higher bicarbonate level would
   support volume depletion as well. Could represent component of systemic
   process if DAH associated with Goodpasture's or Wegener's.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold standing lasix for now
   - repeat UA  ( intermediate positive at rehab)
   -sending antibodies for DAH as above
   .
   # paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds, rate in 60s this am
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient's abdomen is quite firm and appears
   distended. On CXR, she appears to have a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Not particularly tender on exam, though this is difficult to
   determine given her mental status. Had small BM on arrival.
   - repeat  KUB pending
   -LFTs, lipase benign
   -attempt to draw back on PEG to decompress stomach
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Continue bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop
   date 12/5 per prior d/c summary
   -bactrim may account for supratheraputic INR
   -role in VAP leading to pulm hemorrhage unclear
   .
   # Alzheimer's/?altered mental status: Recent baseline unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]
   discuss with family in AM. For now, likely delirium given acute event
   on top of usual dementia. Will continue home meds when using PEG tube
   (await KUB result).
   .
   # PPx: PPI, INR therapeutic & pneumoboots, bowel regimen prn
   .
   # Code: full, confirmed with son [**Name (NI) 6287**] [**Name (NI) 904**] who is HCP
   .
   # Access: Right-sided PICC (placed at [**Hospital1 54**] during previous admission)
   .
   # Communication: With patient and son [**Name (NI) 6287**] [**Known lastname 6767**]([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6768**] cell
   .
   # Dispo: ICU level care given vent requirement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's bronchoscopy showed bloody secretions that progressively worsened, suggesting diffuse alveolar hemorrhage as the most likely diagnosis. This is supported by the decrease in hematocrit from 29 to 23.8 over a short period of time. The patient is being given fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse INR, 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for hematocrit less than 21, and an active search for DAH workup including ANCA. Vitamin K is also being administered to correct coagulopathy.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to be ventilator-dependent at her rehab facility. She will have full ventilator support with airway clearance techniques (AC) though airways were quite collapsable. Pressure support may be feasible later today.

","Summary:
- 89-year-old patient with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) presenting with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.
- The patient has been experiencing blood-tinged secretions that progressed to frank blood, suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), especially considering anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin.
- The patient is currently receiving full ventilator support and has pneumonia.
- There is evidence of acute renal failure, likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss.
- The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (afib) with an INR > 5 on coumadin.
- The patient's abdomen is firm and appears distended, with a large gas bubble seen on chest X-ray, possibly indicating gastrointestinal issues.
- The patient recently had a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Stenotrophomonas.

Potential medical complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's bloody secretions and decreased hematocrit suggest DAH. This is further supported by anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin. Immediate supportive care with reversal of INR and workup for DAH is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to be ventilator-dependent, requiring full ventilator support with airway clearance. Pressure support"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection who presented with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, and impressive hypernatremia. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. She has been receiving blood transfusions and has shown improvement in her bleeding from the tracheostomy site. However, she still has active bleeding from the PICC line insertion site, which is a stage 2 ulcer. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. Her chest X-ray reveals increased pulmonary vascular markings and bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The patient's abdominal distension may be due to ileus or bowel obstruction, and she has a history of recent Stenotrophomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's presentation of bloody secretions from the tracheostomy site and progressive worsening over time suggests DAH. This is further supported by the findings on bronchoscopy showing bloody secretions that did not clear. DAH can be caused by various"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection presenting with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, and impressive hypernatremia. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current conditions. These include:

1. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's bloody secretions and decreased hematocrit suggest DAH, which is likely due to Goodpasture's syndrome or Wegener's granulomatosis. The patient will need supportive care with reversal of INR and workup for DAH.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is likely compromised due to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and uptitration of lasix at rehab. Renal dosing of medications and avoiding nephrotoxins should be considered.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to be ventilator dependent at her rehab facility. She will require full ventilator support with airway stabilization and pressure support may be feasible later today.

4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient's INR is elevated due to coumadin therapy, which was recently started at the rehab facility. Hold coumadin and aspirin, consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of the acute episode.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI presents
   with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Now
   that INR reversed trach oozing decreased
   - After FFP and Vit K INR 1.4
   - HCT, goal > 24 to received 2 more units PRBC, check post transfusion
   HCT.
   - active T&S, has PICC for access. However Stage II ulcer surrounding
   pICC, must be removed. Failed bedside picc on L, IR order in.
   - DAH workup including antiGBM, ANCA pending
   - f/u BAL culture, blood cx
   - monitor oxygenation with appropriate ventilator support, attempt to
   decreased FIO2
   - no more vitamin K
   -per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach consider CT neck to f/u
   fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not stabilize after
   correction of coags
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   .
   # Respiratory failure: The patient continues to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility. Post-bronch she will have full ventilator
   support with AC though airways were quite collapsable.
   - weaned propofol yesterday
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - Increased PVC on CXR, believe intravascularly euvolemic but 3^rd
   spacing [**2-4**] low alb. Will give 40 IV lasix after transfusion in attempt
   to mobilize fluid.
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -decreased FIO2 to 50%, will attempt PS if possible
   .
   # Cellulitis: surrounding PEG site.
   -          started vanco given h/o MRSA
   -          awaiting ID approval
   -          switching PICC site [**2-4**] necrotic stage 2 ulcer
   -          wound care consult appreciated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab as creatinine has trended
   up over the past week per their records. Higher bicarbonate level would
   support volume depletion as well. Could represent component of systemic
   process if DAH associated with Goodpasture's or Wegener's.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - giving Lasix post transfusion since PVC to mobilze fluid
   (intravascularly may be dry but large vol 3^rd spacing
   - repeat UA  negative
   -sending antibodies for DAH as above
   .
   # paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient's abdomen is quite firm and appears
   distended. On CXR, she appears to have a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Not particularly tender on exam, though this is difficult to
   determine given her mental status. Had small BM on arrival.
   - repeat  KUB no acute process
   -LFTs, lipase benign
   -when attempt to draw back on PEG no air.
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Continue bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop
   date 12/5 per prior d/c summary
   -bactrim may account for supratheraputic INR
   -role in VAP leading to pulm hemorrhage unclear
   .
   # Alzheimer's/?altered mental status: Recent baseline unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]
   discuss with family in AM. For now, likely delirium given acute event
   on top of usual dementia. Will continue home meds when using PEG tube
   (await KUB result).

1. Blood from tracheostomy: The patient initially had blood-tinged secretions from her tracheostomy, which progressed to frank blood. Her hematocrit levels have decreased over time. A bronchoscopy demonstrated bloody secretions, suggesting a possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K to reverse her coagulopathy, and her INR is now within normal range. She will receive two more units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and post-transfusion HCT will be checked. The workup for DAH, including anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), is pending. The patient's oxygenation will be monitored with appropriate ventilator support, and attempts will be made to decrease FiO2. No more vitamin K will be given.

   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and uptitration of lasix at rehab as creatinine has trended
   up over the past week per their records. Higher bicarbonate level would
   support volume depletion as well. Could represent component of systemic
   process if DAH associated with Goodpasture's or Wegener's.

   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, and urinary tract infection who presented with altered mental status, sepsis physiology, and impressive hypernatremia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's tracheal secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to frank blood over time. A bronchoscopy revealed bloody secretions that did not clear but became progressively bloodier, making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage a likely diagnosis. This could also represent a lesion near the tracheal insertion site, but this is less likely given the bronchoscopic findings. Given her anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, supportive care with reversal of INR and workup for DAH is needed. FFP was given to correct the INR, and the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 21, with a goal of greater than 24. Active tissue and serum testing has been initiated, along with ANCA testing. Follow-up BAL culture and blood cultures are also planned. The patient's oxygenation will be monitored with appropriate ventilator support, and serial Hct and coagulation studies will be performed.

   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Now
   that INR reversed trach oozing decreased
   - After FFP and Vit K INR 1.4
   - HCT, goal > 24 to received 2 more units PRBC, check post transfusion
   HCT.
   - active T&S, has PICC for access. However Stage II ulcer surrounding
   pICC, must be removed. Failed bedside picc on L, IR order in.
   - DAH workup including antiGBM, ANCA pending
   - f/u BAL culture, blood cx
   - monitor oxygenation with appropriate ventilator support, attempt to
   decreased FIO2
   - no more vitamin K
   -per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach consider CT neck to f/u
   fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not stabilize after
   correction of coags
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   .
   # Respiratory failure: The patient continues to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility. Post-bronch she will have full ventilator
   support with AC though airways were quite collapsable.
   - weaned propofol yesterday
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - Increased PVC on CXR, believe intravascularly euvolemic but 3^rd
   spacing [**2-4**] low alb. Will give 40 IV lasix after transfusion in attempt
   to mobilize fluid.
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -decreased FIO2 to 50%, will attempt PS if possible
   .
   # Cellulitis: surrounding PEG site.
   -          started vanco given h/o MRSA
   -          awaiting ID approval
   -          switching PICC site [**2-4**] necrotic stage 2 ulcer
   -          wound care consult appreciated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab as creatinine has trended
   up over the past week per their records. Higher bicarbonate level would
   support volume depletion as well. Could represent component of systemic
   process if DAH associated with Goodpasture's or Wegener's.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - giving Lasix post transfusion since PVC to mobilze fluid
   (intravascularly may be dry but large vol 3^rd spacing
   - repeat UA  negative
   -sending antibodies for DAH as above
   .
   # paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient's abdomen is quite firm and appears
   distended. On CXR, she appears to have a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Not particularly tender on exam, though this is difficult to
   determine given her mental status. Had small BM on arrival.
   - repeat  KUB no acute process
   -LFTs, lipase benign
   -when attempt to draw back on PEG no air.
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Continue bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop
   date 12/5 per prior d/c summary
   -bactrim may account for supratheraputic INR
   -role in VAP leading to pulm hemorrhage unclear
   .
   # Alzheimer's/?altered mental status: Recent baseline unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]
   discuss with family in AM. For now, likely delirium given acute event
   on top of usual dementia. Will continue home meds when using PEG tube
   (await KUB result).

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI, presenting with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia. She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, cellulitis around the PEG site, acute renal failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and abdominal distension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's bloody secretions from the tracheostomy tube and decreasing hematocrit levels suggest the possibility of DAH. This requires supportive care, reversal of INR, and workup for DAH including anti-GBM antibodies and ANCA.
2. Pneumonia: The patient continues to be ventilator-dependent, and there is evidence of pneumonia with increased pulmonary vascular markings on the chest X-ray. Treatment for pneumonia includes appropriate antibiotics, nebulized bronchodilators, and decreased FiO2.
3. Cellulitis around PEG site: The patient has a stage 2 ulcer surrounding the PEG tube insertion site. This requires wound care consult and treatment with vancomycin due to a history of MRSA.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure secondary to volume depletion and blood loss. Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.
5. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation:"

   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on

   FFP, Vitamin K.  Now that INR reversed trach oozing decreased, although
   INR now trending up again. Transfused 2U yesterday w/Hct change from
   22.8 -> 25.4 and dropped t o24.0 today. ANCA negative. Now w/1x tarry
   black guiac positive stool.
   - Vitamin K 5/day for 3 days to keep INR down
   - Q12h HCT with goal > 24
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u BAL culture, blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin

   fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not stabilize after
   correction of coags
   .
   # Respiratory failure: The patient continues to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PSV trials, to trach mask if patient favorable
   - lasix boluses to reduce pulmonary edema
   .
   # Cellulitis: surrounding PEG site.
   -          started vanco given h/o MRSA
 for 10day course if erythema
   starts to improve with 3 days of vanco
   -          place padding between peg and skin to prevent breakdown
   -          will call IP to let them know, circle erythema

   # Abdominal distension: Improved today. Yesterday patient's abdomen was
   quite firm and appeared distended. On CXR, she appears to have a large
   gas bubble in the stomach. Not particularly tender on exam, though this
   is difficult to determine given her mental status. Had small BM on

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from MICU. She presents with altered mental status (AMS), elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy.

2. The patient's secretions initially were ""blood-tinged"" and progressed to frank blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear but became progressively bloodier, making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) the most likely diagnosis. However, it could also represent a lesion near the tracheostomy insertion site, although this is less likely given bronchoscopic findings.

3. The patient is receiving supportive care with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. She has been transfused with 2U yesterday with Hct change from 22.8 -> 25.4 and dropped to 24.0 today. ANCA-negative. Now with 1x tarry black guiac positive stool.

4. Vitamin K 5/day for 3 days to keep INR down. Q12h HCT with a goal of >"

 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):
   Ongoing blood loss, has guaiac + stool,  and also has hematoma at PIC
   line site.  Will
   try and correct coagulopathy in attempt to stop bleeding, otherwise she
   may need GI w/u.  Increase to PPI [**Hospital1 **].
   Respiratory failure:  tolerating PSV well, although very low Vt, given
   poor respiratory system compliance.   So will tolerate hypercarbia.
   Hypervolemia:  continue attempts at diuresis as she is grossly fluid
   overloaded.
   ?Peg site cellulitis:  if not improved consider treating for fungal
   infection, if improves can do full course of therapy for cellulits.
   AF: rate controlled.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 89-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure after recent sepsis. She presented with pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of coagulopathy. The patient had a replaced PICC line due to an ulcer near the site. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells yesterday. There are no known drug allergies. 

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 12/4 and Bactrim on 12/6. She is currently on several medications including Furosemide (Lasix), Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), chlorhexidine, Protonix, SSI, Atrovent, hep s/q, lactulose, and others. 

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as her review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for the noted changes above and below. 

Her vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 37.3 C (99.2 F)
- Heart rate: 100 bpm (61-100)
- Blood pressure: 176/70 mmHg (95/80-176/95)
- Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute (7-29)
- Oxygen saturation: 93%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,841 mL total, with 781 mL given orally, 1,050 mL given intravenously, and 656 mL given as blood products. Her output was 995 mL total, with 635 mL via urine, 146 mL via NG tube, and the remaining balance through other means. 

The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 0 mL, spontaneous tidal volume of 250 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance of 22.2 cmH2O/mL, and a respiratory system compliance index of 122. Her arterial blood gas results are pending. 

On physical examination, the patient appears to be in no acute distress. Her eyes and conjunctiva are normal, and her cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. However, her peripheral pulses are diminished bilaterally. She has rhonchorous breath sounds in her chest and erythema around her PEG tube site. Her extremities are edematous, and her skin is warm. 

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, leukocyte count of 207 K/uL, platelet count of 115 mg/dL, sodium level of 1.5 mg/dL, potassium level of 40 mEq/L, chloride level of 33 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 91 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen level of 135 mEq/L, creatinine level of 24."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Given
   FFP, Vitamin K.  Now that INR reversed trach oozing decreased, although
   INR now trending up again, up to 2.5 today. Had 1x tarry black guiac
   positive stool yesterday, today w/heme positive brown stool, but Hct
   stable.  Giving PO Vitamin K 5mg x 3 days.  Unclear why INR continues
   to be supratherapeutic. LFTs wnl.  Platelets wnl. Could be due to IV
   Bactrim?  Needs coagulopathy reversed before can safely return to rehab
   given presenting complaint of alveolar hemorrhage. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - 1x IV vitamin K today, recheck INR tomorrow
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - ( to keep in mind: per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach
   consider CT neck to f/u fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not
   stabilize after correction of coags)
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs and academia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI  - increase albuterol MDI to Q4h
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Erythema surrounding PEG site.  Erythema likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin
   -          Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics
   [**12-14**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records. Higher bicarbonate
   level would support volume depletion as well.
   - hold lasix
   - urine lytes, urine Eos
   - spin urine for casts
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - re-check vanco trough tomorrow
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Continue bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop
   date 12/5 per prior d/c summary
   -bactrim may account for supratheraputic INR
   -role in VAP leading to pulm hemorrhage unclear
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, erythema surrounding her PEG site, acute renal failure, left arm hematoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, abdominal distension, and recent Stenotrophomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: The patient's frank blood from the tracheostomy and decreased hematocrit levels suggest diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Given her anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, supportive care with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is needed.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and a recent history of tarry black stool and heme-positive brown stool, indicating a possible bleeding disorder. The cause of the INR being supratherapeutic is unclear, but it could be due to IV Bactrim. Reversal of coagulopathy with vitamin K administration is necessary.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial decompensation may be due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, but there are also contributions from underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline lung"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a history of anemia, peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, dementia, hemoptysis, atrial fibrillation, bacteremia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/52 to 176/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, antibiotics, and nutrition through a feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia, indicating a previous infection. In the ICU, the risk of developing additional infections is higher due to invasive procedures, use of medical devices, and a weakened immune system.

2. Bleeding: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, suggesting a history of bleeding. In the ICU, the patient may be at risk of further bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant medications like heparin and potential complications related to their medical conditions.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure. In the ICU, there is a risk of worsening respiratory status due to underlying lung conditions, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or other complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Given
   FFP, Vitamin K.  Now that INR reversed trach oozing decreased, although
   INR now trending up again. Transfused 2U yesterday w/Hct change from
   22.8 -> 25.4 and dropped t o24.0 today. ANCA negative. Now w/1x tarry
   black guiac positive stool.
   - Vitamin K 5/day for 3 days to keep INR down
   - Q12h HCT with goal > 24
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u BAL culture, blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach consider CT neck to f/u
   fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not stabilize after
   correction of coags
   .
   # Respiratory failure: The patient continues to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PSV trials, to trach mask if patient favorable
   - lasix boluses to reduce pulmonary edema
   .
   # Cellulitis: surrounding PEG site.
   -          started vanco given h/o MRSA
 for 10day course if erythema
   starts to improve with 3 days of vanco
   -          place padding between peg and skin to prevent breakdown
   -          will call IP to let them know, circle erythema
   -          switching PICC site [**2-4**] necrotic stage 2 ulcer
   -          wound care consult appreciated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab as creatinine has trended
   up over the past week per their records. Higher bicarbonate level would
   support volume depletion as well. Could represent component of systemic
   process if DAH associated with Goodpasture's or Wegener's.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - giving Lasix post transfusion since PVC to mobilze fluid
   (intravascularly may be dry but large vol 3^rd spacing
   -sending antibodies for DAH as above, to follow
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Improved today. Yesterday patient's abdomen was
   quite firm and appeared distended. On CXR, she appears to have a large
   gas bubble in the stomach. Not particularly tender on exam, though this
   is difficult to determine given her mental status. Had small BM on
   arrival. Repeat  KUB no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign. When
   attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Continue bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop
   date 12/5 per prior d/c summary
   -bactrim may account for supratheraputic INR
   -role in VAP leading to pulm hemorrhage unclear
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).
   .
   # PPx: Increase PPI to [**Hospital1 **], d/c heparin SQ since INR 2.0. Continue
   pneumoboots. Change bowel regimen to prn b/c of diarrhea.
   .
   #FEN: re-start TF as per nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. Her hematocrit has decreased from 29 to 23.8, and she has bloody secretions on bronchoscopy suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. She is currently on aspirin and coumadin, and her INR is now trending up again. She also has a tarry black guiac positive stool.

Potential medical complications:
1. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's presentation of bloody secretions and progressive bloodiness over time suggests DAH. Given her anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, this diagnosis is likely. Supportive care with reversal of INR and workup for DAH is warranted.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and frank blood from tracheostomy indicate a coagulation disorder. Vitamin K has been given to reverse the INR, but it is now trending up again. Close monitoring and further evaluation for coagulopathy are necessary.
3. Vitamin K deficiency: The patient's altered mental status and elevated INR suggest possible vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K supplementation has been initiated to keep INR down.
4. Renal failure: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure who presented with pulmonary hemorrhage. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, coagulopathy, PEG site cellulitis, acute on chronic renal failure, and hemorrhage. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/46 to 150/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a PSV mode, set at 20 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. She has received various medications, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and other ICU medications. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's neurological status is poor, with no attentiveness, inability to follow simple commands, and no assessed movement or tone. The plan includes trying to rest the patient on AC, starting albuterol every four hours, continuing vancomycin for 10 days, holding further lasix due to suspected intravascular hypovolemia, and considering discharge to rehab tomorrow.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Given
   FFP, Vitamin K.  Now that INR reversed trach oozing decreased, although
   INR now trending up again, up to 2.5 today. Had 1x tarry black guiac
   positive stool yesterday, today w/heme positive brown stool, but Hct
   stable.  Giving PO Vitamin K 5mg x 3 days.  Unclear why INR continues
   to be supratherapeutic. LFTs wnl.  Platelets wnl. Could be due to IV
   Bactrim?  Needs coagulopathy reversed before can safely return to rehab
   given presenting complaint of alveolar hemorrhage. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - 1x IV vitamin K today, recheck INR tomorrow
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - ( to keep in mind: per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach
   consider CT neck to f/u fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not
   stabilize after correction of coags)
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs and academia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI  - increase albuterol MDI to Q4h
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Erythema surrounding PEG site.  Erythema likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin
   -          Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics
   [**12-14**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records. Higher bicarbonate
   level would support volume depletion as well.
   - hold lasix
   - urine lytes, urine Eos
   - spin urine for casts
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - re-check vanco trough tomorrow
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Continue bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop
   date 12/5 per prior d/c summary
   -bactrim may account for supratheraputic INR
   -role in VAP leading to pulm hemorrhage unclear
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).
   .
   # PPx: Increase PPI to [**Hospital1 **], d/c heparin SQ since INR 2.0. Continue
   pneumoboots. Change bowel regimen to prn b/c of diarrhea.
   .
   #FEN: re-start TF as per nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, erythema surrounding PEG site, acute renal failure, L arm hematoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, abdominal distension, recent Stenotrophomonas VAP, and Alzheimer's altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: The patient has bloody secretions from her tracheostomy that did not clear but became progressively bloodier. This raises the concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, especially given the patient's anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and she has tarry black stools and heme-positive brown stool. This suggests a coagulopathy that needs to be reversed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially decompensated due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, but other factors such as underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline lung disease may also contribute.
4. Erythema Surrounding PEG Site: The patient has erythema likely due to dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Given
   FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin K IV for refractory elevated INR.
   Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. Needs coagulopathy reversed
   before can safely return to rehab given presenting complaint of
   alveolar hemorrhage. ANCA negative, anti GBM pending.
   - 1x IV vitamin K today, recheck INR tomorrow
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - ( to keep in mind: per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach
   consider CT neck to f/u fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not
   stabilize after correction of coags)
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct trended down after 2U PRBC given. In
   setting of melena and another Hct drop to 22.8, transfused additional
   2U 2 d ago.  Now w/additional Hct drop to 20.7 today w/out clear
   explanation.  Hemolysis labs sent.  Moderate hematoma in L arm and
   possibly anterior chest, but not enough to explain Hct drop.
   Possibility of spontaneous intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage?
   -          Non-contrast abd CT
   -          f/u hemolysis labs
   -          follow hematoma size
   -          Post transfusion Hct, Q12h Hcts
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records.  UOP had been poor
   and unresponsive to lasix but has improved over last 12 h as per
   nursing.  Higher bicarbonate level and FeUREA of 34% would support
   volume depletion as well.  UA w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.
   Did have hematuria, but difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling
   foley, elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - hold lasix
   - pm lytes
   - spin urine for casts (team to do, not lab)
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs and academia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Increased albuterol MDI to Q4h yesterday.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI  -
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Erythema surrounding PEG site.  Erythema likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin
   -          Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics
   [**12-14**]
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.  Anterior chest wall mass
   likely a continuation of same process.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.  In setting of Hct drop
   and spontaneous alveolar bleeding, could possibly due to
   intraperitoneal bleeding?
   - f/u CT result
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop date today
   per prior d/c summary.
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).
   .
   # PPx: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **], d/c heparin SQ since INR 2.0. Continue
   pneumoboots. Change bowel regimen to prn b/c of diarrhea.
   .
   #FEN: re-start TF as per nutrition.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 89-year-old individual with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU.
- The patient presents with acute mental status changes (AMS), elevated INR, and frank blood from the tracheostomy.
- The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, indicating possible anemia or blood loss.
- The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with episodes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and pneumonia.
- The patient also exhibits signs of erythema around the PEG tube site, which may indicate skin breakdown or cellulitis.
- There is a hematoma in the left arm and possibly on the anterior chest wall, which could be related to a traumatic PICC line placement.
- The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was on coumadin with an elevated INR.
- The patient has experienced abdominal distension, which resolved with a bowel movement.
- The patient had a recent Stenotrophomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently being treated with Bactrim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: The patient's presentation of AMS, elevated INR, and bloody secretions from the tracheostomy suggests the possibility of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). DAH is a severe complication that"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female now with chronic ventilatory failure and re-admission from
   outside facility now re-admitted with signfiicant hemoptysis and
   persistent respiratory failure.  This hemoptysis was in the setting of
   anticoagulation started for atrial fibrillation but not with hemotysis
   patient will need clear control of coagulopathy.  Of note is that she
   is having worsening renal failure and evolution of signficant and
   persistent anemia.
   1)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])-
   -Bactrim
   -Atrovent
   -Vanco/Unasyn
   -Will continue with A/C support and will need slow RR as possible
   -bactrim to be completed today
   2)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-
   -Patient with persistent and worsening renal function in the setting of
   likely pre-renal azotemia
   -Will work to maintain adequate volume status
   3)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)-Much
   of initial loss may well have been related to pulmonary hemorrhage but
   have seen persistent and ongoing anemia.  INR has now been corrected to
   1.5.  The findings on exam suggesting chest wall hematoma is concerning
   for possible blood loss but is relatively large volume.
   -Check Hemorrhage
   -Continue FFP
   -Would consider Chest/Abd Ct for evaluation of possible sources of
   ongong bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with chronic ventilatory failure and re-admission from an outside facility. She is currently experiencing significant hemoptysis and persistent respiratory failure. The patient has worsening renal function and persistent anemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and not associated with ARDS. She will need clear control of coagulopathy and continue with A/C support. Slow RR as possible will be required.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has persistent and worsening renal function, likely pre-renal azotemia. Maintaining adequate volume status will be essential in managing this condition.

3. Anemia: The patient is experiencing acute anemia secondary to blood loss. INR has been corrected to 1.5, and ongoing bleeding needs to be evaluated further. Possible sources of ongoing bleeding should be assessed, and consideration should be given to a chest/abdominal CT.

4. Edema: The patient has peripheral edema, which needs to be managed appropriately.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which requires attention to prevent any potential infections or complications.

6. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, including Alzheimer's and multi-infarct dementia.

7. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis is significant and needs to be addressed promptly.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - ( to keep in mind: per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach
   consider CT neck to f/u fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not
   stabilize after correction of coags)
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs sent.
   Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest, but likely
   source of  Hct drop.  Possibility of spontaneous intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage r/o with CT abd yesterday
   -  hemolysis labs negative
   -          follow hematoma size
   -          s/p 1 U pRBC  [**Date range (1) 6895**]
   -          Post transfusion Hct, Q12h Hcts
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but
   difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley, elevated INR,
   and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - hold lasix
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   -Cr responding well to blood transfusion
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Increased albuterol MDI to Q4h yesterday.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI  -
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # PEG site.  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin
   - increased Pus this am
   - Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - CT showed Peg balloon eroded into gastric wall, likely source of
   melena. Repositioned by IP. OK for meds but not feeds so dobhoff
   inserted.
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.  Anterior chest wall mass
   likely a continuation of same process.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.  In setting of Hct drop
   and spontaneous alveolar bleeding, CT abd obtained, no evidence of RP
   bleed
   .
   # porcelain gallbladder: noted on CT abd, associated with
   adenocarcinoma 25% of time. [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU
   setting.
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop date [**12-8**]
   per prior d/c summary.
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).
   .
   # PPx: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **], d/c heparin SQ since INR 2.0. Continue
   pneumoboots. Change bowel regimen to prn b/c of diarrhea.
   .
   #FEN: re-start TF as per nutrition.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient has experienced several complications during her ICU stay, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, anemia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, PEG site infection, L arm hematoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, abdominal distension, and a porcelain gallbladder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: The patient initially presented with bloody secretions that progressively worsened, indicating a possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and may require urgent bronchoscopy and transfusion.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have dropped significantly since admission, which could be due to ongoing blood loss or hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be secondary to volume depletion, lasix overuse, or a possible obstructive uropathy caused by a staghorn kidney stone.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage,"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Given
   FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin K IV for refractory elevated INR.
   Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. Needs coagulopathy reversed
   before can safely return to rehab given presenting complaint of
   alveolar hemorrhage. ANCA negative, anti GBM pending.
   - 1x IV vitamin K today, recheck INR tomorrow
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - ( to keep in mind: per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach
   consider CT neck to f/u fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not
   stabilize after correction of coags)
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct trended down after 2U PRBC given. In
   setting of melena and another Hct drop to 22.8, transfused additional
   2U 2 d ago.  Now w/additional Hct drop to 20.7 today w/out clear
   explanation.  Hemolysis labs sent.  Moderate hematoma in L arm and
   possibly anterior chest, but not enough to explain Hct drop.
   Possibility of spontaneous intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage?
   -          Non-contrast abd CT
   -          f/u hemolysis labs
   -          follow hematoma size
   -          Post transfusion Hct, Q12h Hcts
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records.  UOP had been poor
   and unresponsive to lasix but has improved over last 12 h as per
   nursing.  Higher bicarbonate level and FeUREA of 34% would support
   volume depletion as well.  UA w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.
   Did have hematuria, but difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling
   foley, elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - hold lasix
   - pm lytes
   - spin urine for casts (team to do, not lab)
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs and academia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Increased albuterol MDI to Q4h yesterday.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI  -
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Erythema surrounding PEG site.  Erythema likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin
   -          Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics
   [**12-14**]
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.  Anterior chest wall mass
   likely a continuation of same process.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.  In setting of Hct drop
   and spontaneous alveolar bleeding, could possibly due to
   intraperitoneal bleeding?
   - f/u CT result
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop date today
   per prior d/c summary.
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).
   .
   # PPx: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **], d/c heparin SQ since INR 2.0. Continue
   pneumoboots. Change bowel regimen to prn b/c of diarrhea.
   .
   #FEN: re-start TF as per nutrition.
   .
   # Code: full, confirmed with son [**Name (NI) 6287**] [**Name (NI) 904**] who is HCP

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from MICU. She presents with acute mental status changes, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, bacteremia, and a history of dementia.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, although underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline lung disease may also contribute. The patient has failed tracheostomy mask and low pressure support ventilation, but improved after increasing pressure support from 10 to 20. The plan is to continue treatment for pneumonia, use albuterol/atrovent MDI every 4 hours, and try to wean off pressure support and PEEP as tolerated.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU. The creatinine has trended up over the past week. The plan is to hold lasix, trend creatinine, renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins, and consider a non-contrast abdominal CT.

The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, with a significant drop in hematocrit. The patient has received"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - ( to keep in mind: per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach
   consider CT neck to f/u fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not
   stabilize after correction of coags)
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs sent.
   Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest, but likely
   source of  Hct drop.  Possibility of spontaneous intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage r/o with CT abd yesterday
   -  hemolysis labs negative
   -          follow hematoma size
   -          s/p 1 U pRBC  [**Date range (1) 6895**]
   -          Post transfusion Hct, Q12h Hcts
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but
   difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley, elevated INR,
   and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - hold lasix
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   -Cr responding well to blood transfusion
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Increased albuterol MDI to Q4h yesterday.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI  -
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # PEG site.  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin
   - increased Pus this am
   - Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - CT showed Peg balloon eroded into gastric wall, likely source of
   melena. Repositioned by IP. OK for meds but not feeds so dobhoff
   inserted.
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.  Anterior chest wall mass
   likely a continuation of same process.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.  In setting of Hct drop
   and spontaneous alveolar bleeding, could possibly due to
   intraperitoneal bleeding?
   - f/u CT result
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop date today
   per prior d/c summary.
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).
   .
   # PPx: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **], d/c heparin SQ since INR 2.0. Continue
   pneumoboots. Change bowel regimen to prn b/c of diarrhea.
   .
   #FEN: re-start TF as per nutrition.
   .
   # Code: full, confirmed with son [**Name (NI) 6287**] [**Name (NI) 904**] who is HCP
   .
   # Access: Right-sided PICC (placed at [**Hospital1 54**] during previous admission).
   To be removed once Left picc placed by IR

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, anemia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, PEG site infection, L arm hematoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, abdominal distension, and Stenotrophomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: The patient has shown signs of bleeding in her respiratory system, which can be life-threatening. It is important to closely monitor her oxygenation levels and consider bronchoscopy to evaluate the source of bleeding.

2. Anemia: The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, indicating anemia. This may contribute to fatigue, weakness, and difficulty breathing. Blood transfusions have been administered to address this issue.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, suggesting impaired kidney function. This could be related to volume depletion, blood loss, and the use of lasix. It is crucial to monitor renal function and avoid nephrotoxic medications.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to diffuse alve"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, dementia (including Alzheimer's and multi-infarct), hemoptysis, atrial fibrillation, bacteremia, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). The patient received endoscopy to adjust peg site, antibiotics including Bactrim, Vancomycin, and Ampicillin/Sulbactam, as well as various ICU medications such as Fentanyl, Midazolam, and Pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are some fluctuations in temperature and blood pressure. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has been on oxygen supplementation. Fluid balance shows a net intake of 3,012 mL and output of 1,147 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,865 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and serum albumin levels, along with abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but there are some imbalances in potassium and sodium levels. The patient's respiratory support mode has changed multiple times, with current settings including a tidal volume of 300 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. In the setting
   of anticoagulation with aspirin and coumadin, needs supportive care
   with reversal of INR and workup for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Given
   FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin K IV for refractory elevated INR.
   Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. Needs coagulopathy reversed
   before can safely return to rehab given presenting complaint of
   alveolar hemorrhage. ANCA negative, anti GBM pending.
   - 1x IV vitamin K today, recheck INR tomorrow
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - ( to keep in mind: per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach
   consider CT neck to f/u fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not
   stabilize after correction of coags)
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct trended down after 2U PRBC given. In
   setting of melena and another Hct drop to 22.8, transfused additional
   2U 2 d ago.  Now w/additional Hct drop to 20.7 today w/out clear
   explanation.  Hemolysis labs sent.  Moderate hematoma in L arm and
   possibly anterior chest, but not enough to explain Hct drop.
   Possibility of spontaneous intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage?
   -          Non-contrast abd CT
   -          f/u hemolysis labs
   -          follow hematoma size
   -          Post transfusion Hct, Q12h Hcts
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records.  UOP had been poor
   and unresponsive to lasix but has improved over last 12 h as per
   nursing.  Higher bicarbonate level and FeUREA of 34% would support
   volume depletion as well.  UA w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.
   Did have hematuria, but difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling
   foley, elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - hold lasix
   - pm lytes
   - spin urine for casts (team to do, not lab)
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs and academia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Increased albuterol MDI to Q4h yesterday.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI  -
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Erythema surrounding PEG site.  Erythema likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin
   -          Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics
   [**12-14**]
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.  Anterior chest wall mass
   likely a continuation of same process.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.  In setting of Hct drop
   and spontaneous alveolar bleeding, could possibly due to
   intraperitoneal bleeding?
   - f/u CT result
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop date today
   per prior d/c summary.

   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).

   # PPx: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **], d/c heparin SQ since INR 2.0. Continue
   pneumoboots. Change bowel regimen to prn b/c of diarrhea.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with acute mental status changes, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient has had multiple complications including anemia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, erythema around the PEG site, a hematoma in her left arm, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She also has a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, bacteremia, and previous respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's presentation of frank blood from the tracheostomy and decreasing hematocrit levels suggest DAH. The bronchoscopy findings of bloody secretions further support this diagnosis. The patient requires supportive care, reversal of INR, and workup for DAH.

2. Hemolysis: The patient's Hct drop without a clear explanation could indicate hemolysis. Labs have been sent to investigate this possibility. The presence of a moderate hematoma in the left arm and possibly the anterior chest wall raises the suspicion of spontaneous intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels, poor urine output, and history of volume depletion secondary to blood loss and diure"

   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but
   difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley, elevated INR,
   and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - hold lasix
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   -Cr responding well to blood transfusion
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Increased albuterol MDI to Q4h yesterday.
   - continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   - chlorhexidine
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI  -
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # PEG site.  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin
   - increased Pus this am
   - Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - CT showed Peg balloon eroded into gastric wall, likely source of
   melena. Repositioned by IP. OK for meds but not feeds so dobhoff
   inserted.
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.  Anterior chest wall mass
   likely a continuation of same process.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.  In setting of Hct drop
   and spontaneous alveolar bleeding, CT abd obtained, no evidence of RP
   bleed
   .
   # porcelain gallbladder: noted on CT abd, associated with
   adenocarcinoma 25% of time. [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU
   setting.
   .
   # Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop date [**12-8**]
   per prior d/c summary.
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).
   .
   # PPx: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **], d/c heparin SQ since INR 2.0. Continue
   pneumoboots. Change bowel regimen to prn b/c of diarrhea.
   .
   #FEN: re-start TF as per nutrition.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from MICU. The patient presents with AMS (altered mental status), elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to frankly blood over the course of the day. Bronchoscopy on arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear but became progressively bloodier, making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage the most likely diagnosis. However, it could also represent a lesion near tracheal insertion but this is less likely given bronchoscopic findings. The patient is held on aspirin and coumadin, reversal of INR with FFP (fresh frozen plasma), Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin K IV. Once INR reversed, tracheal oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti-GBM pending.

The patient has anemia with a Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood. Initial drop explained by DAH (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage). Hct did not bump appropriately, found to have melena x1 and repeatedly guaiac positive stool. Hemolysis labs sent. Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla, and anterior chest, but likely source of Hct drop. Possibility of spontaneous intr"

- The patient's chief complaint is unknown.
- The patient has a history of ineffective coping, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure (not ARDS), renal failure (acute renal failure/ARF), anemia (acute, secondary to blood loss/hemorrhage), peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct), hemoptysis, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), bacteremia, and respiratory failure (not ARDS).
- The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Bactrim on 12/8/2197 at 9:00 PM, Vancomycin on 12/8/2197 at 9:28 PM, Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn) on 12/9/2197 at 12:46 PM, and Ampicillin on 12/10/2197 at 12:58 AM.
- The patient is currently on various infusions including Pantoprazole (Protonix) started on 12/9/2197 at 7:57 AM.
- The patient has allergies to no known drugs.
- The patient's medical history includes dementia, atrial fibrillation, bacteremia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and more.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Flow sheet data as of 12/10/2197 at 05:24 AM shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.
- Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments, which were not assessed.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other abnormal values.
- The patient's disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and blood gases will be necessary. The need for mechanical ventilation should be evaluated based on the patient's clinical condition.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance. Monitoring serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine output will be important.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary. Blood transfusion may be required if the patient's anemia is symptomatic.
4. Peripheral Edema: The patient has peripheral edema, which could be related to fluid balance issues. Monitoring fluid intake and output, as well as assessing for signs of fluid overload, will be important.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to increased risk of infections. Regular skin assessments should be conducted to monitor for any pressure ulcers or other skin complications.
6. Dementia: The patient has a history"

   disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed 2
   days ago.  Now w/3+GNR in sputum stain, but culture is not complete yet
   and patient is not spiking fevers or having hypotension so will not
   treat at this point.
   - follow sputum culture
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - slow lasix drip to facilitate diuresis
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but
   difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley, elevated INR,
   and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - gentle lasix with PM lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after 3 days on vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsened over
   last 48 hours with increasingly purulent exudate around the tube.
   Patient also with erosion of gastric wall around PEG site IP evaluated
   - culture exudate
   - Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - CT showed Peg balloon eroded into gastric wall, likely source of
   melena. Repositioned by IP. OK for meds but not feeds so dobhoff
   inserted.
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Does not
   appear to worsening but will follow closely.  Anterior chest wall mass
   likely a continuation of same process.
   -          warm packs to area
   -          to follow.
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S, has new PICC for access
   - antiGBM pending
   - f/u blood cx
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - ( to keep in mind: per IP given timeline of 2 weeks s/p trach
   consider CT neck to f/u fistula if bleeding does not stop, HCT does not
   stabilize after correction of coags)
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs sent.
   Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest, but likely
   source of  Hct drop.  Possibility of spontaneous intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage r/o with CT abd yesterday

   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Resolved with bowel movement.  Had CXR
   several days ago with what appeared to be a large gas bubble in the
   stomach. Repeat  KUB showed no acute process, LFTs and lipase benign.
   When attempt to draw back on PEG no air noted.  In setting of Hct drop
   and spontaneous alveolar bleeding, CT abd obtained, no evidence of RP
   bleed

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has had various complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, PEG complications, and a hematoma in her left arm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had episodes of respiratory failure in the past and is currently ventilator-dependent due to high RISBIs and acidemia. There is a need to closely monitor and manage her respiratory support.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated over the past week, possibly due to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up titration of lasix. It is important to manage her fluid balance carefully and avoid nephrotoxins.

3. PEG Complications: The patient is experiencing erythema and purulent exudate around the PEG tube site, indicating possible infection or cellulitis. This requires prompt attention and appropriate antibiotic treatment.

4. L Arm Hematoma: The patient has a hematoma in her left arm likely due to traumatic PICC line placement. Although it does not appear to be worsening, close monitoring is necessary.

5. Blood from Tracheostomy: The patient has been experiencing"

   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but
   difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley, elevated INR,

   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after 3 days on vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsened over
   last 48 hours with increasingly purulent exudate around the tube.
   Patient also with erosion of gastric wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by
   IP showed that peg balloon still in stomach, was re-positioned to
   decrease pressure on wall to better allow for healing. No free
   intraperitoneal air was noted on CT.  PEG to gravity, not to be used as
   per ID recommendations.  Surgery consulted by IR to evaluate case.
   - Culture exudate
   - Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - As per IR recommendations, will re-check CT on Monday or Tuesday to
   eval whether will need surgical removal or can heal on own

   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Blood
   tracking from area expanding but Hct is stable.
   - warm packs to area
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S
   - antiGBM pending
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today.
   - follow hematoma size
   - follow Hct, transfuse as necessary
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Has been intermittently present since

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses previously caused
   rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed.  Now
   w/3+GNR in sputum stain, but culture is not complete yet and patient is
   not spiking fevers or having hypotension so will not treat at this
   point.
   - sputum cult shows Ecoli, suggestive of aspiration
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - increase lasix drip to facilitate diuresis since cr decreasing  and
   UO increasing
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but since
   resolved difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley,
   elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.  Cr now downtrending
   with lasix, perhaps correction of the anemia has improved kidney
   profusion and is allowing further diuresis.
   - lasix gtt with PM lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after starting  vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsening
   purulent exudate around the tube. Patient also with erosion of gastric
   wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by IP showed that peg balloon still in
   stomach, was re-positioned to decrease pressure on wall to better allow
   for healing. No free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT. [**12-11**] repeat
   EGD showed dobbhoff still post pyloric. Eroson around peg greatly
   improved. PEG ballon in place. No stiches needed.
   - Culture exudate GS shows 2+ GNR, cult pending. Covering with zosyn
   until final cult results as pus is increasing
   - Continue vanco for 10day course for cellulitis
 last day of
   antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - As per IP recommendations, PEG to low intermittent suction.  KUB
   tomorrow to confirm PEG placement, dobhoff placement and no free air.
   To re-eval PEG with CT end of week. Plan to restart TF Monday. IP says
   this issue should not keep pt in hospital
   .
   # Positive UA: History of urosepsis with proteus sensitive to unasyn so
   re-started on unasyn while awaiting UCx results.
   -          continue unasyn until UCx resulted

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed 2
   days ago.  Now w/3+GNR in sputum stain, but culture is not complete yet
   and patient is not spiking fevers or having hypotension so will not
   treat at this point.
   - follow sputum culture
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - slow lasix drip to facilitate diuresis
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but
   difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley, elevated INR,
   and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - gentle lasix with PM lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after 3 days on vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsened over
   last 48 hours with increasingly purulent exudate around the tube.
   Patient also with erosion of gastric wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by
   IP showed that peg balloon still in stomach, was re-positioned to
   decrease pressure on wall to better allow for healing. No free
   intraperitoneal air was noted on CT.  PEG to gravity, not to be used as
   per ID recommendations.  Surgery consulted by IR to evaluate case.
   - Culture exudate
   - Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - As per IR recommendations, will re-check CT on Monday or Tuesday to
   eval whether will need surgical removal or can heal on own
   .
   # Positive UA: History of urosepsis with proteus sensitive to unasyn so
   re-started on unasyn while awaiting UCx results.
   -          continue unasyn until UCx resulted
   -          f/u UCx
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Blood
   tracking from area expanding but Hct is stable.
   - warm packs to area
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S
   - antiGBM pending
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today.
   - follow hematoma size
   - follow Hct, transfuse as necessary
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Has been intermittently present since
   admission. Usually resolves with bowel movement.  LFTs and lipase
   normal. CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder,
   but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal
   process.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU setting for finding of porcelain
   gallbladder
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).

   resolved, can transfer to rehab.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the medical intensive care unit (MICU). She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially decompensated due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, although other factors like underlying lung disease, fluid overload, and baseline [known last name] disease may contribute. She has failed tracheostomy mask and low-pressure support ventilation during this admission but improved after increasing pressure support. She also showed improvement after an albuterol nebulizer treatment.
2. Acute renal failure: This is likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up-titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU. Her creatinine levels have trended upwards over the past week. There is also evidence of possible urinary tract infection (UTI) and a history of urosepsis. Anti-GBM antibodies are pending.
3. PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) complications: The patient has erythema and pus around the PEG site, likely a combination of dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on the skin with some cellulitic component. Initially, it improved after 3 days on vancomycin, but it worsened"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses d/c at this point b/c
   of rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed 2
   days ago.  Now w/3+GNR in sputum stain, but culture is not complete yet
   and patient is not spiking fevers or having hypotension so will not
   treat at this point.
   - follow sputum culture
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - slow lasix drip to facilitate diuresis
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but
   difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley, elevated INR,
   and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.
   - gentle lasix with PM lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after 3 days on vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsened over
   last 48 hours with increasingly purulent exudate around the tube.
   Patient also with erosion of gastric wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by
   IP showed that peg balloon still in stomach, was re-positioned to
   decrease pressure on wall to better allow for healing. No free
   intraperitoneal air was noted on CT.  PEG to gravity, not to be used as
   per ID recommendations.  Surgery consulted by IR to evaluate case.
   - Culture exudate
   - Continue vanco for 10day course
 last day of antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - As per IR recommendations, will re-check CT on Monday or Tuesday to
   eval whether will need surgical removal or can heal on own
   .
   # Positive UA: History of urosepsis with proteus sensitive to unasyn so
   re-started on unasyn while awaiting UCx results.
   -          continue unasyn until UCx resulted
   -          f/u UCx
   .
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Blood
   tracking from area expanding but Hct is stable.
   - warm packs to area
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S
   - antiGBM pending
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today.
   - follow hematoma size
   - follow Hct, transfuse as necessary
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Has been intermittently present since
   admission. Usually resolves with bowel movement.  LFTs and lipase
   normal. CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder,
   but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal
   process.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU setting for finding of porcelain
   gallbladder
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has multiple complications including acute renal failure, PEG site complications, positive urine analysis, left arm hematoma, and blood from tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial decompensation is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, but other factors such as underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline lung disease may also contribute. The patient has been ventilator-dependent and has failed tracheostomy mask and low-pressure support ventilation. She requires continued monitoring and management of her respiratory status.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up-titration of lasix. She has a history of urosepsis, and her creatinine levels have been trending upwards. Further evaluation and management of her renal function are necessary.
3. PEG Site Complications: The patient has erythema and pus around the PEG site, which is likely a combination of dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of the PEG on the skin with some cellulitic component. The patient's condition worsened"

   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today.

   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from MICU. She presents with acute mental status changes, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial decompensation is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, with potential contributions from underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline [known lastname] disease. She has been unsuccessfully extubated twice before and could not be weaned off the ventilator due to high RSBI and acidemia. The patient's air movement improved after increasing pressure support from 10 to 20 and using an albuterol nebulizer treatment. Lasix boluses were discontinued due to rising creatinine levels. A sputum culture is pending, and the patient will continue to undergo PSV trials with attempts to wean pressure support and PEEP as tolerated.

2. Acute renal failure: This is likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up-titration of lasix at the rehabilitation facility and in MICU. The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up over the past week. Higher bicarbonate levels and FeUREA of 34% support volume depletion as well. A urinalysis with few eosinophils, rare hyaline casts, and hematuria was"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing worsening PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) site with discharge cultured. An endoscopy is planned for Monday morning, which may include the placement of sutures. A post-procedure CT scan will be performed to determine if surgical removal of the PEG is necessary or if it can heal in place. The patient is NPO after midnight in preparation for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) tomorrow.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), current temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 77 bpm with a range of 61-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/58 mmHg to 165/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with a range of 20-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 300 mL, respiratory rate set at 22, peak inspiratory pressure of 33 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 31 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses previously caused
   rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed.  Now
   w/3+GNR in sputum stain, but culture is not complete yet and patient is
   not spiking fevers or having hypotension so will not treat at this
   point.
   - sputum cult shows Ecoli, suggestive of aspiration
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - increase lasix drip to facilitate diuresis since cr decreasing  and
   UO increasing
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but since
   resolved difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley,
   elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.  Cr now downtrending
   with lasix, perhaps correction of the anemia has improved kidney
   profusion and is allowing further diuresis.
   - lasix gtt with PM lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after starting  vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsening
   purulent exudate around the tube. Patient also with erosion of gastric
   wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by IP showed that peg balloon still in
   stomach, was re-positioned to decrease pressure on wall to better allow
   for healing. No free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT. [**12-11**] repeat
   EGD showed dobbhoff still post pyloric. Erosion around peg greatly
   improved. PEG ballon in place. No stiches needed.
   - Culture exudate GS shows 2+ GNR, cult pending. Unasyn switched to
   zosyn  to cover Pseudomonas until final cult results as pus is
   increasing
   - Continue vanco for 10day course for cellulitis
 last day of
   antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - As per IP recommendations, PEG to low intermittent suction.  KUB
   tomorrow to confirm PEG placement, dobhoff placement and r/o free air.
   To re-eval PEG with CT end of week. Plan to restart TF Monday. IP says
   this issue should not keep pt in hospital
   .
   # Positive UA: History of urosepsis with proteus sensitive to unasyn so
   re-started on unasyn while awaiting UCx results.  Culture shows VRE but
   pt remains asymptomatic, no fevers, no WBC. Unasyn switched to zosyn as
   above
   -          monitor for signs of infection
   -          on zosyn for GNR from PEG culture which should cover anyway.
   -          f/u sensitivities
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Blood
   tracking from area expanding but Hct is stable.
   - warm packs to area
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S
   - antiGBM pending
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today. Melena explained by
   gastric wall erosion
   - follow hematoma size
   - follow Hct, transfuse as necessary
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Has been intermittently present since
   admission. Usually resolves with bowel movement.  LFTs and lipase
   normal. CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder,
   but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal
   process.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU setting for finding of porcelain
   gallbladder
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with acute mental status changes, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, PEG complications, positive urine analysis, left arm hematoma, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial decompensation may be due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, but other factors such as underlying lung disease, fluid overload, and baseline Alzheimer's disease could also contribute. The patient has been unsuccessful in extubation attempts and requires ventilator support.

2. Acute Renal Failure: This is likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up titration of lasix. The patient's creatinine has trended up over the past week, and higher bicarbonate levels and FEUREA support volume depletion.

3. PEG Complications: The patient has erythema and pus around the PEG site, likely a combination of dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure and cellulitic component. Despite initial improvement with vancomycin and a padded bandage, the purulent exudate has worsened. An endoscopy showed that the PEG balloon was repositioned to decrease pressure on the gastric wall for better"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, PEG complications, positive urine analysis, left arm hematoma, and blood from tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced decompensation likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Other contributing factors such as underlying lung disease, fluid overload, and baseline COPD may also contribute. The patient has been ventilator dependent and has failed tracheostomy mask and low-pressure support ventilation. Increasing pressure support from 10 to 20 improved her air movement. Albuterol nebulizer treatment also improved her air movement.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up-titration of lasix. Her creatinine level has trended up over the past week, indicating worsening renal function. Higher bicarbonate levels and FeUREA of 34% support volume depletion. Anti-GBM pending. Lasix drip has been increased to facilitate diuresis, and creatinine is now downtrending. Medications will be renally dosed, and nephrotoxins will be avoided.
3. PEG Complications: The patient has erythema/purulent exudate around the PEG site, likely a combination of dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure and cellulitic component. The PEG balloon was repositioned to decrease pressure on the gastric wall, and no free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT. Culture of exudate grows 2+ GNR, and treatment has been switched to zosyn until final culture results are available.
4. Positive Urine Analysis: The patient has a history of urosepsis with proteus sensitive to unasyn. Unasyn was restarted, but culture shows VRE. The patient remains asymptomatic, and monitoring for signs of infection is recommended.
5. Left Arm Hematoma: The patient has a hematoma in her left arm due to traumatic PICC placement. Blood tracking from the area is expanding, but her hematocrit is stable. Warm packs to the area and follow-up on hematocrit are recommended.
6. Blood from Tracheostomy: The patient has frank blood from her tracheostomy, which may be due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or a lesion near the tracheostomy insertion. Bronchoscopy demonstrated bloody secretions that did not clear and became progressively bloodier. The patient's INR was reversed, and anti-GBM pending.
7. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped three times since admission"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses previously caused
   rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed.  Now
   w/3+GNR in sputum stain, but culture is not complete yet and patient is
   not spiking fevers or having hypotension so will not treat at this
   point.
   - sputum cult shows Ecoli, suggestive of aspiration
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - increase lasix drip to facilitate diuresis since cr decreasing  and
   UO increasing
   - PSV trials, continue to try to wean pressure support and peep as
   tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but since
   resolved difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley,
   elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.  Cr now downtrending
   with lasix, perhaps correction of the anemia has improved kidney
   profusion and is allowing further diuresis.
   - lasix gtt with PM lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after starting  vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsening
   purulent exudate around the tube. Patient also with erosion of gastric
   wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by IP showed that peg balloon still in
   stomach, was re-positioned to decrease pressure on wall to better allow
   for healing. No free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT. [**12-11**] repeat
   EGD showed dobbhoff still post pyloric. Erosion around peg greatly
   improved. PEG ballon in place. No stiches needed.
   - Culture exudate GS shows 2+ GNR, cult pending. Unasyn switched to
   zosyn  to cover Pseudomonas until final cult results as pus is
   increasing
   - Continue vanco for 10day course for cellulitis
 last day of
   antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - As per IP recommendations, PEG to low intermittent suction.  KUB
   tomorrow to confirm PEG placement, dobhoff placement and r/o free air.
   To re-eval PEG with CT end of week. Plan to restart TF Monday. IP says
   this issue should not keep pt in hospital
   .
   # Positive UA: History of urosepsis with proteus sensitive to unasyn so
   re-started on unasyn while awaiting UCx results.  Culture shows VRE but
   pt remains asymptomatic, no fevers, no WBC. Unasyn switched to zosyn as
   above
   -          monitor for signs of infection
   -          on zosyn for GNR from PEG culture which should cover anyway.
   -          f/u sensitivities
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Blood
   tracking from area expanding but Hct is stable.
   - warm packs to area
   - follow Hct
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S
   - antiGBM pending
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today. Melena explained by
   gastric wall erosion
   - follow hematoma size
   - follow Hct, transfuse as necessary
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Has been intermittently present since
   admission. Usually resolves with bowel movement.  LFTs and lipase
   normal. CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder,
   but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal
   process.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU setting for finding of porcelain
   gallbladder
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, PEG complications, positive urine analysis, left arm hematoma, blood from tracheostomy, anemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, abdominal distension, Alzheimer's altered mental status, and malnutrition. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, with a possible contribution from underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline lung disease. The patient has also been unsuccessfully extubated twice in the past and has not been able to be weaned off the ventilator due to high RISBIs and acidemia. 

The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up-titration of lasix at rehab and in the MICU. 

The patient's PEG complications include erythema and pus around the PEG likely due to dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on the skin with some cellulitic component. 

The patient's positive urine analysis shows E. coli, which is suggestive of aspiration. 

The patient's left arm hematoma is likely due to traumatic PICC line placement. 

The patient's blood from tracheostomy initially was ""blood-tinged"" and progressed to frank blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, as well as melena and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is being managed with Coumadin, but the patient's INR is currently 5, which is higher than the desired therapeutic range. 

The patient's abdominal distension is not fully explained and may be due to multiple factors including bowel obstruction, constipation, or medication effects. 

The patient's Alzheimer's altered mental status is a chronic condition that is not improving with acute events. 

The patient's malnutrition is being addressed with fibrous HN and TF via Dobhoff tube. 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is ICU level care now, with plans to transfer to rehab once her coagulopathy, infectious, and PEG complications are resolved."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hemorrhage/hematoma, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, ineffective coping, alteration in nutrition, edema, peripheral, impaired skin integrity, dementia, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, inability to communicate, impaired knowledge, impaired posture, impaired balance, and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they do have a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and elevated creatinine level. The patient's most recent imaging shows evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, which indicates a severe respiratory condition. There is a risk of further deterioration or complications related to the ventilator.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function. This could lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Hemorrhage/hematoma: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including a hemat"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses previously caused
   rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed.  E
   coli in sputum, urine and wound
 suggests aspiration.
   - sputum cult shows Ecoli, suggestive of aspiration
   - albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - increase lasix drip to facilitate diuresis since Cr decreasing  and
   UO increasing
 will adjust based on labs
   - will attempt to decreased RR to assess whether pt can breathe over
   vent, failed PSV yesterday
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but since
   resolved difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley,
   elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM pending.  Cr now downtrending
   with lasix, perhaps correction of the anemia has improved kidney
   profusion and is allowing further diuresis.
   - lasix gtt with improvement in Cr
 cont to follow lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   - staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after starting  vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsening
   purulent exudate around the tube. Patient also with erosion of gastric
   wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by IP showed that peg balloon still in
   stomach, was re-positioned to decrease pressure on wall to better allow
   for healing. No free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT. [**12-11**] repeat
   EGD showed dobbhoff still post pyloric. Erosion around peg greatly
   improved. PEG ballon in place. No stiches needed.
   - Culture exudate GS shows 2+ GNR, cult pending. Unasyn switched to
   zosyn  to cover Pseudomonas until final cult results as pus is
   increasing
 switched top vanco
   - Continue vanco for 10day course for cellulitis
 last day of
   antibiotics [**12-14**]
   - As per IP recommendations, PEG to low intermittent suction.  KUB
   tomorrow to confirm PEG placement, dobhoff placement and r/o free air.
   To re-eval PEG with CT end of week. Plan to restart TF Monday. IP says
   this issue should not keep pt in hospital
   .
   # Positive UA: History of urosepsis with proteus sensitive to unasyn so
   re-started on unasyn while awaiting UCx results.  Culture shows VRE but
   pt remains asymptomatic, no fevers, no WBC. Unasyn switched to zosyn as
   above
   -          monitor for signs of infection
   -          e coli grew from cx [**12-12**]
ing wound, urine and sputum E
   coli with Ceftriaxone per sensitivities
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Blood
   tracking from area expanding but Hct is stable.
   - warm packs to area
   - follow Hct
 stable [**12-12**]
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending.
   - INR 1.4
   - Active T&S
   - antiGBM pending
   - hold aspirin and coumadin
   - stable crits
   - no longer an issue
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today. Melena explained by
   gastric wall erosion
   - follow hematoma size
   - follow Hct, transfuse as necessary
 crit stable as [**12-12**]
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - hold coumadin and aspirin
   - consider full dose aspirin for anticoagulation once out of acute
   episode
   - patient typically bradycardic per prior d/c summary, not on rate
   control meds, rate less than 100 over last 24 hrs [**12-12**]
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Has been intermittently present since
   admission. Usually resolves with bowel movement.  LFTs and lipase
   normal. CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder,
   but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal
   process.
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU setting for finding of
   porcelain gallbladder
   -          No acute issues
   .
   # Alzheimer's/? altered mental status: Low functioning at baseline.
   Delirium given acute event on top of usual dementia not improving
   situation. To continue home meds when using PEG tube (await KUB
   result).
   .
   # PPx:  [**Hospital1 **] PPI, pneumoboots, PRN bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with acute mental status changes, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient's respiratory failure is due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, with underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline [known lastname] disease contributing. There is also evidence of aspiration with E. coli in sputum, urine, and wound. The patient has acute renal failure likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU. Additionally, she has PEG complications with erythema and pus around the PEG site, erosion of the gastric wall, and ongoing bloody secretions from the tracheostomy. Other issues include positive urine analysis, hematoma in the left arm, anemia with melena, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, abdominal distension, and Alzheimer's altered mental status. The patient has a DNR and DNI code status."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses previously caused
   rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed.  E
   coli in sputum, urine and wound, currently being treated with
   ceftriaxone.
   - E.coli sensitive to ceftriaxone
   - continue albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - successfully diuresed with lasix drip to 5mg/hr
   - continue to try PS as tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but since
   resolved difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley,
   elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM negative.  Cr now downtrending
   with lasix, perhaps correction of the anemia has improved kidney
   profusion and is allowing further diuresis.
   - lasix gtt with improvement in Cr
 will convert to IV lasix prior to
   d/c
   - trend creatinine, significantly improving
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after starting  vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsening
   purulent exudate around the tube. Patient also with erosion of gastric
   wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by IP showed that peg balloon still in
   stomach, was re-positioned to decrease pressure on wall to better allow
   for healing. No free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT. [**12-11**] repeat
   EGD showed dobbhoff still post pyloric. Erosion around peg greatly
   improved. PEG ballon in place. No stiches needed.
   - continue ceftriaxone for E.coli (d1= [**12-12**]) and vancomycin for
   cellulitis (vanco done on [**12-14**])
   - As per IP recommendations, PEG to low intermittent suction.  PEG tip
   at 2cm from stomach wall, should not be moved and allowed 3 wks to
   heal. Ok to start tube feeds.
   .
   # Positive UA: Urine cultures shows E.coli, ceftriaxone sensitive.
   Urine clearing in color.
   -          monitor for signs of worsening infection
   -          continue antibiotics
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Blood
   tracking from area expanding but Hct is stable.
   - warm packs to area
   - follow Hct
 stable [**12-12**]
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending. HCT stable.
   - INR 1.3
   - Active T&S
   - antiGBM negative
   - hold anticoagulation
   - monitor hct
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today. Melena explained by
   gastric wall erosion.
   - follow hct, currently stable
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - no anticoagulation at this time
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Has been intermittently present since
   admission. Usually resolves with bowel movement.  LFTs and lipase
   normal. CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder,
   but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal
   process.
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU setting for finding of
   porcelain gallbladder
   -          No acute issues

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. She presents with altered mental status, elevated INR, and frank blood from her tracheostomy. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, PEG complications, positive urine analysis, l arm hematoma, blood from tracheostomy, anemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, abdominal distension, and Alzheimer's altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pneumonia, fluid overload, and underlying lung disease. She has been ventilator dependent and failed tracheostomy and low-pressure support ventilation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and the up-titration of lasix. Her creatinine levels have been trending up over the past week.
3. PEG complications: The patient has erythema and pus around the PEG site, which is likely a combination of dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure and cellulitis. There is also erosion of the gastric wall around the PEG site.
4. Positive urine analysis: The patient's urine culture shows E. coli, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. Monitoring for signs"

   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   : Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage,
   although contribution of underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and
   baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of note, during prior
   admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice and could not be
   weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high RISBIs  and

   coli in sputum, urine and wound, currently being treated with
   ceftriaxone.
   - E.coli sensitive to ceftriaxone in all three sources. To continue 14
   day course of abx to finish on [**12-25**]
   - continue albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - successfully diuresed with lasix drip to 5mg/hr when TF held. Now
   even I/O. Convert to 60 IV TID for discharge
   - failed attempt on trach mask today after 5 min [**2-4**] RR in 50s
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   : Likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up
   titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine has trended up
   over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate level and
   FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  Did have

   - lasix gtt  converted  to IV lasix 60mg TID
   - trend creatinine, significantly improving
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   .
 MALNUTRITION
    PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component.  Improved after starting  vanco and after padded
   bandage placed between PEG and skin.  Purulent exudate around the tube
   decreased since starting Ecoli treatment. Patient had erosion of
   gastric wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by IP showed that peg balloon
   still in stomach, was re-positioned to decrease pressure on wall to
   better allow for healing. No free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT.
   [**12-11**] repeat  EGD showed erosion around peg greatly improved. PEG ballon
   in place.  This was confirmed on [**12-14**] abd CT, no leakage of gastric
   contents
   - continue ceftriaxone for E.coli (abx day 1 [**12-11**], CTXd1= [**12-12**]) for 14
   days to end [**12-25**]
   - vancomycin for cellulitis d/c today
   - As per IP recommendations.  PEG tip at 2cm from stomach wall, should
   not be moved and allowed 3 wks to heal. Ok to start tube feeds.
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   : Urine cultures shows E.coli, ceftriaxone sensitive.  Urine clearing

","Based on the provided information, the patient's progress note indicates several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has a history of pneumonia and requires prolonged mechanical ventilation. There is also evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which can contribute to respiratory failure. The patient's air movement improved after increasing pressure support and using albuterol nebulizer treatment.

2. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have been trending upwards, indicating potential acute renal failure. This may be related to volume depletion due to blood loss and the up-titration of Lasix.

3. Malnutrition: The patient has a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube for nutrition. There were complications such as erythema and pus around the PEG site, likely due to skin breakdown and cellulitis. The erosion of the gastric wall around the PEG site improved after repositioning the balloon and using a padded bandage.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine cultures showed E. coli, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for the UTI.

5. Hemorrhage/Hematoma, Procedure-related: The patient had a traumatic PICC line placement, resulting in blood tracking down the chest wall. However, the hematocrit levels are stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo with PMH of alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis,
   pneumonia, and recent d/c from MICU presents with AMS, elevated INR and
   frank blood from her tracheostomy.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia,
   fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?) likely contribute.  Of
   note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice
   and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high
   RISBIs  and acidemia.  The patient continued to be ventilator dependent
   at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure
   support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes
   (down to 130
s) which improved after pressure support was increased
   from 10 to 20. Patient
s air movement also did improve after albuterol
   nebulizer treatment as per nurse.   Lasix boluses previously caused
   rising Cr.  Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed.  E
   coli in sputum, urine and wound, currently being treated with
   ceftriaxone.
   - E.coli sensitive to ceftriaxone
   - continue albuterol/atrovent MDI
   - successfully diuresed with lasix drip to 5mg/hr
   - continue to try PS as tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to
   blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine
   has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate
   level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.  UA
   w/few eos, rare hyaline casts reported.  Did have hematuria, but since
   resolved difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley,
   elevated INR, and likely UTI. Anti-GBM negative.  Cr now downtrending
   with lasix, perhaps correction of the anemia has improved kidney
   profusion and is allowing further diuresis.
   - lasix gtt with improvement in Cr
 will convert to IV lasix prior to
   d/c
   - trend creatinine, significantly improving
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins as possible
   .
   # PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of
   dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some
   cellulitic component. Initially improved after starting  vanco and
   after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsening
   purulent exudate around the tube. Patient also with erosion of gastric
   wall around PEG site. Endoscopy by IP showed that peg balloon still in
   stomach, was re-positioned to decrease pressure on wall to better allow
   for healing. No free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT. [**12-11**] repeat
   EGD showed dobbhoff still post pyloric. Erosion around peg greatly
   improved. PEG ballon in place. No stiches needed.
   - continue ceftriaxone for E.coli (d1= [**12-12**]) and vancomycin for
   cellulitis (vanco done on [**12-14**])
   - As per IP recommendations, PEG to low intermittent suction.  PEG tip
   at 2cm from stomach wall, should not be moved and allowed 3 wks to
   heal. Ok to start tube feeds.
   .
   # Positive UA: Urine cultures shows E.coli, ceftriaxone sensitive.
   Urine clearing in color.
   -          monitor for signs of worsening infection
   -          continue antibiotics
   # L arm hematoma: Likely due to traumatic picc placement.  Blood
   tracking from area expanding but Hct is stable.
   - warm packs to area
   - follow Hct
 stable [**12-12**]
   .
   # Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that
   patient's secretions initially were ""blood tinged"" and progressed to
   frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**]. Her hematocrit in
   the same time period has decreased from 29-->23.8. Bronchoscopy on
   arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear
   but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
   most likely diagnosis. However, could also represent lesion near trach
   insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings. Held aspirin
   and coumadin, reversal of INR with  FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin
   K IV .  Once INR reversed trach oozing decreased. ANCA negative, anti
   GBM pending. HCT stable.
   - INR 1.3
   - Active T&S
   - antiGBM negative
   - hold anticoagulation
   - monitor hct
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission. Transfused 3x with 2U of blood.
   Initial drop explained by DAH. Hct did not bump appropriately, found to
   have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool. Hemolysis labs
   negative.  Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla,  and anterior chest,
   but likely source of  Hct drop.  CT showed no intraperitoneal or
   retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Hct stable today. Melena explained by
   gastric wall erosion.
   - follow hct, currently stable
   .
   # Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the
   rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily. CHADs-2 score
   by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o
   hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
   - no anticoagulation at this time
   .
   # Abdominal distension: NTTP.  Has been intermittently present since
   admission. Usually resolves with bowel movement.  LFTs and lipase
   normal. CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder,
   but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal
   process.
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] need further work up out of ICU setting for finding of
   porcelain gallbladder
   -          No acute issues
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old individual with a medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, urosepsis, pneumonia, and recent discharge from the MICU. The patient presents with acute mental status changes, elevated INR, and frank blood from the tracheostomy. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, PEG complications, positive urine analysis, left arm hematoma, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory issues, including initial decompensation due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline lung disease. The patient has also failed tracheostomy mask and low-pressure support ventilation. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The cause of acute renal failure is likely volume depletion secondary to blood loss and the up-titration of lasix. It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's renal function and adjust diuretic therapy accordingly to prevent worsening renal failure.

3. PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) complications: The patient has developed erythema and purulent exudate around the PEG site, along with erosion of the gastric wall. Repositioning of the PEG balloon"
