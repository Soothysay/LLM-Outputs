   Newly inserted left-sided central venous access line over the internal
   jugular
   vein. The tip of the line projects over the upper SVC. The tip of the
   newly
   inserted Dobbhoff catheter projects over the middle parts of the
   stomach.
   There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.
   Positional
   blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, presence of a small right
   pleural
   effusion cannot be excluded.
   [**11-2**] CT chest
   IMPRESSION:
   1. New interval bilateral opacification at the lung bases, concerning
   for
   aspiration, pneumonia, or less likely atelectasis. Bilateral small
   pleural
   effusions.
   2. Cardiomegaly.
   3. Stable ascending aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.8 cm.
   4. Emphysema.
   [**2109-11-2**] CT head
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Areas of low attenuation in the periventricular and subcortical
   white
   matter, likely consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
   2. Possible lytic area noted at the anterior edge of C1, partially
   evaluated
   on the current scan. Likely degenerative cyst. Correlate with MRI of

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Pt with h/o HF and COPD,
   so likely mutifactorial. Lasix and Lisinopril were held and the pt was
   receiving IVF
s which could have tipped him over towards pulmonary
   edema although imaging doesn
t fully support this. Requires 2L O2 at
   baseline. Also seen to have bilateral opacifications at the bases.
   - Continue with Levofloxacin for CAP, today is day [**1-31**]
   - Follow speciation of initial 1+ GNR
s on sputum Cx
   - lasix 40 mg IV BID as blood pressure will tolerate
   - Captopril was held yesterday for low bp. If bp can tolerate through
   today, would add it back for afterload reduction.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID for heart failure
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - Pressure support has been weaned from 10
 5 and pt is oxygenating
   well
   - CO2
s continue to be in the high 50
s, which may be were pt lives
   chronically with h/o COPD.
   - SBT today with plans to wean and hopefully extubated
   - Will need scheduled nebs after extubation.
   Tachycardia: Sepsis vs volume depletion vs anemia with falling Hct vs
   didn
t get beta blockade on the floor. Volume depletion less likely as
   pt with good bp, has been net positive through yesterday and was not
   getting Lasix on the floor. Could be evolving septic picture as pt with
   low grade temps over yesterday and h/o temp to 102 recently. BCx
   negative to date.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   - Watch BCx
s and continue Levofloxacin for now, if appears to be
   getting more septic, broaden coverage
   Hypotension: Patient transiently hypotensive in the setting of
   receiving large doses of metoprolol, diltiazem, propofol and induction
   agents for intubation.  Then seen to have episode of hypotension after
   admission which has now resolved and pt is mildly hypertensive
   currently.
   - Have switched to Fentanyl Versed instead of Propofol for sedation
   - Consider small amts of fluids if hypotense with h/o CHF
   - follow blood cultures
   - Restarted on home dose of steroids
   Delerium: Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis includes
   medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities etc.  Urinalysis
   negative.  Blood cultures pending.  [**Month (only) 60**] have small pneumonia on xray.
   ABG intially with well compensated respiratory acidosis now with acute
   decompensation.  Morphine may be contributing.
   - Tylenol and Fentanyl for pain as needed
   - - follow blood and urine cultures
   - PRN zydis for agitation
   - Will try to wean sedation through today and see how his mental status
   is
   Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worsened at 1.9 and rising.
   - Consider small amts of fluids, also if hypotensive, but need to be
   careful with h/o CHF
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.  No
   signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past 48
   hours.
   - active type and screen
 outdates [**2109-11-3**]
   - Guiac all stools
   - Trend Hct
 repeat this pm
   - iron deficient
 start PO iron through NGT and bowel regimen
   - Folate, B12 normal
   - Iron studies more consistent with ACD
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   Hypertension: Transiently hypotensive in the setting of medications.
   Would likely benefit from resuming afterload reduction in the setting
   of severe MR/AR.
   - Can restart Captopril 12.5 mg TID if not having any more hypotension
   through today
   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV BID
   - captopril 12.5 mg TID
   - resume metoprolol
   - I/O goal -1  liter today as bp can tolerate
   COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol
   Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - holding agents while has foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
    Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin. Will start PPI today.
    Access: femoral line (will remove if hemodynamically stable after
   extubation and not requiring central access), arterial line

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Pt with h/o HF and COPD,
   so likely mutifactorial. Lasix and Lisinopril were held and the pt was
   receiving IVF
s which could have tipped him over towards pulmonary
   edema although imaging doesn
t fully support this. Requires 2L O2 at
   baseline. Also seen to have bilateral opacifications at the bases.
   - Continue with Levofloxacin for CAP, today is day [**1-31**]
   - Follow speciation of initial 1+ GNR
s on sputum Cx
   - lasix 40 mg IV BID as blood pressure will tolerate
   - Captopril was held yesterday for low bp. If bp can tolerate through
   today, would add it back for afterload reduction.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID for heart failure
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - Pressure support has been weaned from 10
 5 and pt is oxygenating
   well
   - CO2
s continue to be in the high 50
s, which may be were pt lives
   chronically with h/o COPD.
   - SBT today with plans to wean and hopefully extubate
   Tachycardia: Sepsis vs volume depletion vs anemia with falling Hct vs
   didn
t get beta blockade on the floor. Volume depletion less likely as
   pt with good bp, has been net positive through yesterday and was not
   getting Lasix on the floor. Could be evolving septic picture as pt with
   low grade temps over yesterday and h/o temp to 102 recently. BCx
   negative to date.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   - Watch BCx
s and continue Levofloxacin for now, if appears to be
   getting more septic, broaden coverage
   Hypotension: Patient transiently hypotensive in the setting of
   receiving large doses of metoprolol, diltiazem, propofol and induction
   agents for intubation.  Then seen to have episode of hypotension after
   admission which has now resolved and pt is mildly hypertensive
   currently.
   - Have switched to Fentanyl Versed instead of Propofol for sedation
   - Consider small amts of fluids if hypotense with h/o CHF
   - follow blood cultures
   - Restarted on home dose of steroids
   Delerium: Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis includes
   medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities etc.  Urinalysis
   negative.  Blood cultures pending.  [**Month (only) 60**] have small pneumonia on xray.
   ABG intially with well compensated respiratory acidosis now with acute
   decompensation.  Morphine may be contributing.
   - Tylenol and Fentanyl for pain as needed
   - - follow blood and urine cultures
   - PRN zydis for agitation
   - Will try to wean sedation through today and see how his mental status
   is
   Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worsened at 1.9 and rising.
   - Consider small amts of fluids, also if hypotensive, but need to be
   careful with h/o CHF
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.  No
   signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past 48
   hours.
   - active type and screen
 outdates [**2109-11-3**]
   - iron deficient
 start PO iron through NGT and bowel regimen
   - Folate, B12 normal
   - Iron studies more consistent with ACD
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   Hypertension: Transiently hypotensive in the setting of medications.
   Would likely benefit from resuming afterload reduction in the setting
   of severe MR/AR.
   - Can restart Captopril 12.5 mg TID if not having any more hypotension
   through today
   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV BID
   - captopril 12.5 mg TID
   - resume metoprolol
   - I/O goal -1  liter today as bp can tolerate
   COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol
   Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - holding agents while has foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
    Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
    Access: femoral line (will remove if hemodynamically stable), arterial

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and transferred from the TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 152/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is intubated and responsive to external stimuli. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, odontoid and right wrist fractures, and a previous episode of hypoxia and hypercarbia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient requires 2L O2 at baseline, indicating respiratory distress. Bilateral opacifications at the lung bases suggest aspiration, pneumonia, or less likely atelectasis. Lasix and Lisinopril were held, and the patient received IV fluids, which could have contributed to pulmonary edema.

2. Sepsis: The patient has low-grade temperatures and a recent history of fever. Blood cultures are pending, and there is a possibility of evolving septicemia. Broadening coverage may be necessary if the patient appears to be getting more septic.

3. Hypotension:"

   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Pt with h/o HF and COPD,
   so likely mutifactorial. Lasix and Lisinopril were held and the pt was
   receiving IVF
s which could have tipped him over towards pulmonary
   edema although imaging doesn
t fully support this. Requires 2L O2 at
   baseline. Also seen to have bilateral opacifications at the bases.
   - Continue with Levofloxacin for CAP, today is day [**1-31**]
   - Follow speciation of initial 1+ GNR
s on sputum Cx
   - lasix 40 mg IV BID as blood pressure will tolerate
   - Captopril was held yesterday for low bp. If bp can tolerate through
   today, would add it back for afterload reduction.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID for heart failure
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - Pressure support has been weaned from 10
 5 and pt is oxygenating
   well
   - CO2
s continue to be in the high 50
s, which may be were pt lives
   chronically with h/o COPD.
   - SBT today with plans to wean and hopefully extubated
   - Will need scheduled nebs after extubation.
   Tachycardia: Sepsis vs volume depletion vs anemia with falling Hct vs
   didn
t get beta blockade on the floor. Volume depletion less likely as
   pt with good bp, has been net positive through yesterday and was not
   getting Lasix on the floor. Could be evolving septic picture as pt with
   low grade temps over yesterday and h/o temp to 102 recently. BCx
   negative to date.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   - Watch BCx
s and continue Levofloxacin for now, if appears to be
   getting more septic, broaden coverage
   Hypotension: Patient transiently hypotensive in the setting of
   receiving large doses of metoprolol, diltiazem, propofol and induction
   agents for intubation.  Then seen to have episode of hypotension after
   admission which has now resolved and pt is mildly hypertensive
   currently.
   - Have switched to Fentanyl Versed instead of Propofol for sedation
   - Consider small amts of fluids if hypotense with h/o CHF
   - follow blood cultures
   - Restarted on home dose of steroids
   Delerium: Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis includes
   medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities etc.  Urinalysis
   negative.  Blood cultures pending.  [**Month (only) 60**] have small pneumonia on xray.
   ABG intially with well compensated respiratory acidosis now with acute
   decompensation.  Morphine may be contributing.
   - Tylenol and Fentanyl for pain as needed
   - - follow blood and urine cultures
   - PRN zydis for agitation
   - Will try to wean sedation through today and see how his mental status
   is
   Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative

   - Folate, B12 normal
   - Iron studies more consistent with ACD
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   Hypertension: Transiently hypotensive in the setting of medications.
   Would likely benefit from resuming afterload reduction in the setting
   of severe MR/AR.
   - Can restart Captopril 12.5 mg TID if not having any more hypotension
   through today
   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the

   COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage congestive heart failure. He was found unconscious in his living apartment and transferred from the TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current medications include Levofloxacin, Metoprolol, Lasix IV, and Prednisone. 

The patient's recent events include being admitted to the ICU, initiation of Levofloxacin, Metoprolol, and Lasix IV, weaning of PS from 10 to 5, current RR in the 20's, saturation at 95%, and administration of Lopressor, which resulted in a drop in blood pressure to the 80's. Propofol was stopped, Captopril was discontinued, and Lasix was held. A 250cc bolus was given.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 11/2/2109 at 12:00 AM, Ciprofloxacin on 11/2/2109 at 12:03 PM, and Cefepime on 11/2/2109 at 02:13 PM.

Infusions include Furosemide (Lasix), Metoprolol, Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), Famotidine (Pepcid), Midazolam (Versed), and Fentanyl.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated, responsive to external stimuli, but does not open his eyes to voice or follow commands. His lungs show upper airway breath sounds with fair air movement. Heart sounds are clear with a systolic and slight diastolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border and left lower sternal border. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no grimacing when palpated. His left arm is in a cast, and there is no evidence of lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 11.0, Hct of 30.8, Plt of 299,000/mm3, Cr of 1.9, Troponin-T of 0.02, TCO2 of 33, and Glucose of 109 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal bilateral opacification at the lung bases, likely due to aspiration pneumonia or atelectasis. There is also evidence of small right pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, stable ascending aortic aneurysm, and emphysema. A CT head shows areas of low attenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes, as well as a possible lytic area at the anterior edge of C1, likely a degenerative cyst.

The patient's assessment and plan include atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, impaired transfers, impaired gait, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, and impaired balance. The patient's conditions include hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, delirium, right wrist fracture, dens fracture, chronic kidney disease, anemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and COPD. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, volume depletion, anemia, hypotension, delirium, pneumonia, chronic kidney disease exacerbation, congestive heart failure exacerbation, and COPD exacerbation."

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Primarily caused by
   acute on chronic diastolic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia.  Improved with diuresis and on room air, as home sats are
   likely in the low 90s and similar.  His sats vary widely depending on
   if he is clearing his secretions, but typically improve with
   suctioning.  On levofloxacin day [**2-28**] today for CAP, given 750mg PO
   QOD.  We will restart diuresis as heart failure is playing a large
   role.
   - levofloxacin 750 mg PO every other day for community acquired
   pneumonia w/ renal failure
   - follow up sputum cultures
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, f/u I/O
s and PM lytes to reassess need for
   second dose.
   - stop captopril to avoid hypotension
   - increase metoprolol to 25 mg PO QID to help tachycardia and HTN.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to mild volume overload
   versus mild infection.  Given concern for congestive heart failure will
   resume patient's home beta blocker and diurese.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   #) s/p femoral line site bleed: Unclear why he had such a severe bleed
   after removal of a venous line with a normal INR and normal platelets.
   Received 1U PRBC with an appropriate bump.  Appears to have been an
   isolated event.
   #) Delerium: Was delirius with an unclear etiology.  Differential
   diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities
   etc.  Urinalysis negative.  Blood cultures pending.  This has improved,
   and he seems to do best with his family at the bedside.
   - tylenol for pain
   - low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   - PRN zydis for agitation
   - Encourage OOB.
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worsened at 1.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - titrate diuresis to avoid large rise in creatinine.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.
   No signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past
   48 hours.  Appears on labs to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - stop captopril
   - metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal - 1 liter today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - holding agents while has foley in place

 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Improved with diuresis and
   on room air, as home sats are likely in the low 90s and similar.  On
   levofloxacin day [**3-2**] today for CAP.  Restart lasix 40mg IV BID.
   Likely multifactorial.  It appears that his heart failure medications
   have been held during this admission including his lasix and lisinopril
   while he has been receiving IVF.  Although his physical exam shows only
   mild volume overload I suspect his heart failure is playing a role.
   The patient also has a history chronic CO2 retention with mild
   emphysema at the apices on imaging.  He requries 2L oxygen at baseline
   with unclear baseline oxygen saturations.  He has been prescribed
   inhalers in the past but does not use any currently.  He also has a
   history of recurrent aspiration and has evidence of small infiltrates
   versus atelectasis on his CT chest.
   - levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily for community acquired pneumonia
   - follow sputum cultures
   - lasix 40 mg IV BID
   - will start low dose captopril for afterload reduction
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO BID for heart failure
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - wean pressure support and FiO2 with plans for SBT tomorrow and
   potential extubation
   Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus tachycardia
   with frequent PACs. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to mild volume overload versus mild
   infection.  Given concern for congestive heart failure will resume
   patient's home beta blocker and diurese.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   s/p femoral line site bleed: Unclear
   - Hct bumped appropriately
   Hypotension: Patient transiently hypotensive in the setting of
   receiving large doses of metoprolol, diltiazem, propofol and induction
   agents for intubation.  Now mildly hypertensive.
   - follow blood cultures
   - will switch to versed if persistent hypotension on propofol
   - if recurrent may need stress dose steroids given chronic use
   Delerium: Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis includes
   medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities etc.  Urinalysis
   negative.  Blood cultures pending.  [**Month (only) 60**] have small pneumonia on xray.
   ABG intially with well compensated respiratory acidosis now with acute
   decompensation.  Morphine may be contributing.
   - tylenol for pain
   - low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   - PRN zydis for agitation
   Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worsened at 1.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.  No
   signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past 48
   hours.
   - active type and screen
   - iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis labs, reticulocyte count
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   Hypertension: Very sensitive to captopril.
   Transiently hypotensive in the setting of medications. Would likely
   benefit from resuming afterload reduction in the setting of severe
   MR/AR.
   - captopril 12.5 mg TID
   - resume metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV BID
   - captopril 12.5 mg TID
   - resume metoprolol
   - I/O goal - 1 liter today
   COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and transferred to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, impaired transfers, impaired gait, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, and impaired balance. He is also experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, delirium, a right wrist fracture, a dens fracture, chronic kidney disease, anemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and acute exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory failure. His current condition includes hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.
3. Fractures: The patient has sustained two fractures, a right wrist fracture and a dens fracture. These fractures may require medical intervention and rehabilitation.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and further complications if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are in the high 20s, indicating anemia. Further investigation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause"

 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Primarily caused by
   acute on chronic diastolic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia.  Improved with diuresis and on room air, as home sats are
   likely in the low 90s and similar.  His sats vary widely depending on
   if he is clearing his secretions, but typically improve with
   suctioning.  On levofloxacin day [**2-28**] today for CAP, given 750mg PO
   QOD.  We will restart diuresis as heart failure is playing a large
   role.
   - levofloxacin 750 mg PO every other day for community acquired
   pneumonia w/ renal failure
   - follow up sputum cultures
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, f/u I/O
s and PM lytes to reassess need for
   second dose.
   - stop captopril to avoid hypotension
   - increase metoprolol to 25 mg PO QID to help tachycardia and HTN.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to mild volume overload
   versus mild infection.  Given concern for congestive heart failure will
   resume patient's home beta blocker and diurese.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   #) s/p femoral line site bleed: Unclear why he had such a severe bleed
   after removal of a venous line with a normal INR and normal platelets.
   Received 1U PRBC with an appropriate bump.  Appears to have been an
   isolated event.
   #) Delerium: Was delirius with an unclear etiology.  Differential
   diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities
   etc.  Urinalysis negative.  Blood cultures pending.  This has improved,
   and he seems to do best with his family at the bedside.
   - tylenol for pain
   - low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   - PRN zydis for agitation
   - Encourage OOB.
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worsened at 1.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - titrate diuresis to avoid large rise in creatinine.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.
   No signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past
   48 hours.  Appears on labs to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - stop captopril
   - metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal - 1 liter today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  put out about 400ccs
   to lasix dose yesterday, will need more than that
   Primarily caused by acute on chronic diastolic heart failure worsened
   by hypertension and tachycardia.  Improved with diuresis and on room
   air, as home sats are likely in the low 90s and similar.  His sats vary
   widely depending on if he is clearing his secretions, but typically
   improve with suctioning.  On levofloxacin day [**3-31**] today for CAP, given
   750mg PO QOD.  We will restart diuresis as heart failure is playing a
   large role.
   - levofloxacin 750 mg PO every other day for community acquired
   pneumonia w/ renal failure
   - follow up sputum cultures
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, f/u I/O
s and PM lytes to reassess need for
   second dose.
   - increase metoprolol to 25 mg PO QID to help tachycardia and HTN.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to mild volume overload
   versus mild infection.  Given concern for congestive heart failure will
   resume patient's home beta blocker and diurese.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   #) s/p femoral line site bleed: Unclear why he had such a severe bleed
   after removal of a venous line with a normal INR and normal platelets.
   Received 1U PRBC with an appropriate bump.  Appears to have been an
   isolated event.
   #) Delerium: Was delirius with an unclear etiology.  Differential
   diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities
   etc.  Urinalysis negative.  Blood cultures pending.  This has improved,
   and he seems to do best with his family at the bedside.
   - tylenol for pain
   - low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   - PRN zydis for agitation
   - Encourage OOB.
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worsened at 1.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - titrate diuresis to avoid large rise in creatinine.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.
   No signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past
   48 hours.  Appears on labs to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - stop captopril
   - metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal - 1 liter today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - holding agents while has foley in place

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and end-stage congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and transferred from the TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications, including electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, impaired transfers, gait, aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, and knowledge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily caused by acute on chronic diastolic heart failure worsened by hypertension and tachycardia. This condition requires careful management of oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia with frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs). The etiology is unclear, but it may be related to mild volume overload or mild infection. It needs to be monitored and managed with appropriate medications.
3. S/p Femoral Line Site Bleed: The patient experienced a severe bleed after removal of a venous line with normal INR and platelets. This could be an isolated event, but further evaluation is needed to prevent future bleeding episodes.
4. Delirium: The patient was delirious with an unclear etiology. Differential diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities"

   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Primarily caused by
   acute on chronic diastolic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s,
   he has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore being kept on 30%
   FiO2 with shovel mask.  His sats vary widely depending on if he is
   clearing his secretions, but typically improve with suctioning.  Has
   been on levofloxacin, which may be worsening his mental status.  We
   will switch to azithro/ceftriaxone instead, with a plan of 7 days.
   Sputum cultures showed just commensal flora.
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 1 of 7.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, f/u I/O
s and PM lytes to reassess need for
   second dose.
   - keep metoprolol at 25 mg PO QID and restart captopril 6.25mg TID to
   reduce afterload.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - goal I/Os today even, so we will hold lasix for now.
   #) Hypernatremia: Likely due to diuresis and slight hypovolemia.  We
   will stop diuresing for now, give 1L of free water, and then monitor.
   - f/u PM lytes.
   #) Delerium: Has been persistently delirious with an unclear etiology.
   Differential diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic
   abnormalities etc.  Has had a possible pneumonia, urine negative, blood
   cx pending.  This has improved, and he seems to do best with his family
   at the bedside.
   - Tylenol first, then low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - repeat UA/culture and blood cultures.
   - PRN zydis for agitation
 has not been required to date.
   - Encourage OOB.
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs. Given concern for congestive heart
   failure will resume patient's home beta blocker and diurese.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar.  Ask ortho how much longer that will be necessary.
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worse at 1.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.
   No signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past
   48 hours.  Appears on labs to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - stop captopril
   - metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal - 1 liter today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - holding agents while has foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, place NG tube for tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin and pneumo boots.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage congestive heart failure. He was found unconscious in his living apartment and was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily caused by acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, worsened by hypertension and tachycardia. He requires supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation levels above 90%. 

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely due to diuresis and slight hypovolemia. This can be managed by stopping diuretics, providing free water, and monitoring electrolyte levels.

3. Delirium: The patient has been persistently delirious with an unclear etiology. Differential diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities, etc. The delirium may improve with family presence at the bedside and the use of Tylenol or low-dose fentanyl for pain management.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an unclear etiology of tachycardia. EKGs show sinus tachycardia with frequent premature atrial contractions. Given concern for congestive heart failure, the patient's home beta-blocker will be resumed,"

 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here is stable with persistently altered mental
   status and difficulty clearing secretions.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore being kept on 30% FiO2
   with shovel mask.  He is still requiring Q3hr or more frequent
   suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to azithro/ceftriaxone out of
   fear of worsening mental status, now day 2 of 7 days.  No organisms on
   sputum.
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 2 of 7.
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Given that he is already almost 1L
   positive, will give 40mg lasix x1.
   - keep metoprolol at 25 mg PO QID and restart captopril 6.25mg TID to
   reduce afterload.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved yesterday with 1L of D5W.  Today we will
   follow and give added free water if needed.
   - f/u PM lytes.
   #) Delerium: Has been persistently delirious with an unclear etiology.
   Differential diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic
   abnormalities etc.  Has had a possible pneumonia, urine negative, blood
   cx pending.  This has improved, and he seems to do best with his family
   at the bedside.
   - Tylenol first, then low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - repeat UA/culture and blood cultures.
   - PRN zydis for agitation
 has not been required to date.
   - Encourage OOB.
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs and PVCs. We are trying to control with
   metoprolol QID.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar.  Ask ortho how much longer that will be necessary.
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved with creatinine 1.3 after receiving extra fluids yesterday.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.8.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - captopril 12.5mg TID and metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:  continue home prednisone
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment days prior to admission and was transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently stable but has persistently altered mental status and difficulty clearing secretions. He requires frequent suctioning and is on 30% FiO2 with a shovel mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary problem is his difficulty clearing secretions, which can lead to recurrent respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Delirium: The patient has been persistently delirious with an unclear etiology. Differential diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic abnormalities, etc.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has improved slightly with 1L of D5W. Further management and free water administration will be needed to correct the electrolyte imbalance.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has an unclear etiology for tachycardia. Metoprolol is being used to control the heart rate.
5. Right Wrist Fracture: The patient has a reduced and casted right wrist fracture, which will require orthopedic follow-up.

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here is stable with persistently altered mental
   status and difficulty clearing secretions.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore being kept on 30% FiO2
   with shovel mask.  He is still requiring Q3hr or more frequent
   suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to azithro/ceftriaxone out of
   fear of worsening mental status, now day 2 of 7 days.  No organisms on
   sputum.
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 2 of 7.
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Given that he is already almost 1L
   positive, will give 40mg lasix x1.
   - keep metoprolol at 25 mg PO QID and restart captopril 6.25mg TID to
   reduce afterload.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved yesterday with 1L of D5W.  Today we will
   follow and give added free water if needed.
   - f/u PM lytes.
   #) Delerium: Has been persistently delirious with an unclear etiology.
   Differential diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic
   abnormalities etc.  Has had a possible pneumonia, urine negative, blood
   cx pending.  This has improved, and he seems to do best with his family
   at the bedside.
   - Tylenol first, then low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - repeat UA/culture and blood cultures.
   - PRN zydis for agitation
 has not been required to date.
   - Encourage OOB.
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs. Given concern for congestive heart
   failure will resume patient's home beta blocker and diurese.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar.  Ask ortho how much longer that will be necessary.
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worse at 1.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.
   No signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past
   48 hours.  Appears on labs to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - stop captopril
   - metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal - 1 liter today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - holding agents while has foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, place NG tube for tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin and pneumo boots.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and brought to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including electrolyte disorder, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, impaired transfers, gait, aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, and knowledge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary problem is difficulty clearing secretions, which has led to periodic drops in oxygen saturation levels. He is currently on 30% FiO2 with a shovel mask.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and fluid management needs to be carefully monitored.
3. Delirium: The patient has persistently delirious behavior with an unclear etiology. Differential diagnosis includes medications, infection, and metabolic abnormalities.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has an unclear etiology for his tachycardia. EKGs show sinus tachycardia with frequent premature atrial contractions.
5. Right Wrist Fracture: The patient has a reduced and casted right wrist fracture with no plans for operative intervention.
6. Dens Fracture: The patient has a type II dens fracture and is currently wearing a collar"

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here is stable with persistently altered mental
   status and difficulty clearing secretions.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore being kept on 30% FiO2
   with shovel mask.  He is still requiring Q3hr or more frequent
   suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to azithro/ceftriaxone out of
   fear of worsening mental status, now day 2 of 7 days.  No organisms on
   sputum.
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 2 of 7.
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Given that he is already almost 1L
   positive, will give 40mg lasix x1.
   - keep metoprolol at 25 mg PO QID and restart captopril 6.25mg TID to
   reduce afterload.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved yesterday with 1L of D5W.  Today we will
   follow and give added free water if needed.
   - f/u PM lytes.
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  Yesterday
   afternoon, his sons thought he was improved, this morning on rounds he
   will not even open his eyes and mostly just withdraws from noxious
   stimuli and mumbles in Cantonese.  We have not found a clear infectious
   source, though ICU admission alone in a man with baseline dementia
   could explain his severe delirium.  We worry that we missed something
   that may have caused his initial fall.  We will consult neurology for
   their input in case we are missing some cause of his persistent altered
   mental status.
   - Neurology consult
   - MRI head w/ and w/o contrast, specifically to assess if he had a
   stroke at some point.
   - Tylenol first, then low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs and PVCs. We are trying to control with
   metoprolol QID.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar.  Ask ortho how much longer that will be necessary.
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved with creatinine 1.3 after receiving extra fluids yesterday.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.8.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - captopril 12.5mg TID and metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:  continue home prednisone
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to acute on chronic heart failure, worsened by hypertension and tachycardia. He is experiencing difficulty clearing secretions and requires frequent suctioning. There is a concern for worsening respiratory status, and the patient is being kept on 30% FiO2 with a shovel mask.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level of 142 mEq/L. The goal is to correct this electrolyte imbalance by providing free water.

3. Delirium: The patient continues to exhibit fluctuating levels of consciousness, ranging from improved to severe delirium. An infectious source has not been found, and there is concern for an underlying cause. A neurology consult has been requested to assess for any missed causes of persistent altered mental status.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an unclear etiology of tachycardia, with frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) seen on EKG. Metoprolol is being used to control the heart rate.

5. Right Wrist Fracture: The patient has a right wrist fracture that has been reduced and casted. No operative intervention is planned.

6. Dens Fracture: The patient also has a dens fracture"

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission found to have odontoid and right wrist fractures now
   transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Primarily caused by
   acute on chronic diastolic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s,
   he has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore being kept on 30%
   FiO2 with shovel mask.  His sats vary widely depending on if he is
   clearing his secretions, but typically improve with suctioning.  Has
   been on levofloxacin, which may be worsening his mental status.  We
   will switch to azithro/ceftriaxone instead, with a plan of 7 days.
   Sputum cultures showed just commensal flora.
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 1 of 7.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, f/u I/O
s and PM lytes to reassess need for
   second dose.
   - keep metoprolol at 25 mg PO QID and restart captopril 6.25mg TID to
   reduce afterload.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential obstructive
   component
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - goal I/Os today even, so we will hold lasix for now.
   #) Hypernatremia: Likely due to diuresis and slight hypovolemia.  We
   will stop diuresing for now, give 1L of free water, and then monitor.
   - f/u PM lytes.
   #) Delerium: Has been persistently delirious with an unclear etiology.
   Differential diagnosis includes medications, infection, metabolic
   abnormalities etc.  Has had a possible pneumonia, urine negative, blood
   cx pending.  This has improved, and he seems to do best with his family
   at the bedside.
   - Tylenol first, then low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - repeat UA/culture and blood cultures.
   - PRN zydis for agitation
 has not been required to date.
   - Encourage OOB.
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs. Given concern for congestive heart
   failure will resume patient's home beta blocker and diurese.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar.  Ask ortho how much longer that will be necessary.
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   slightly worse at 1.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, now in the high 20s.
   No signs of acute blood loss currently.  Has trended down over the past
   48 hours.  Appears on labs to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - stop captopril
   - metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal - 1 liter today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:
   - continue home prednisone
   - holding allopurinol
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - holding agents while has foley in place
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, place NG tube for tube feeds

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and brought to the hospital with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, impaired transfers, gait, aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, knowledge, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/36 to 166/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face tent and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 118.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear heart sounds with a systolic and slight diastolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border and left lower sternal border. His abdomen is soft with no tenderness or grimacing when palpated. He has an impaired gait and balance due to a right wrist fracture, which has been reduced and casted. Additionally, the patient has a dens fracture, for which he is wearing a collar.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.3, hematocrit of 26.4, platelet count"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, not delirium.
- They have atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS.
- The patient also has impaired transfers, gait, aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, and knowledge.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation and an upper extremity fracture.
- Encephalopathy is present, and the patient is less interactive.
- The patient's right hand is swollen, and they withdraw with movement of fingers but not thumb or wrist.
- Neurological examination is consistent with encephalopathy, and an MRI instead of CT scan is recommended.
- If the patient spikes a new fever despite antibiotics, a lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered.
- The patient is persistently tachycardic and has received an extra dose of metoprolol.
- The patient has been given extra doses of medications such as heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and famotidine (Pepcid).
- The patient has undergone various tests including an ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and chest X-ray.
- The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder, as well as other medical conditions, need to be addressed.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever and has pending cultures for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), urine culture, and blood culture. There is also a concern for meningitis if the patient spikes a new fever despite antibiotics.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and their oxygenation status needs to be closely monitored. The chest X-ray shows increasing left pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity, indicating possible worsening of respiratory function.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and decreased interaction suggest encephalopathy. Further investigation and management are required, including the recommended MRI scan.

4. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB), which may contribute to the persistent tachycardia. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary.

5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, as indicated by the abnormal laboratory values. Ongoing monitoring and correction of imbalances are essential.

6. Wound infection or complications: The patient's upper extremity fracture increases the risk of wound infection or other complications. Regular assessment of the wound and surrounding tissues is necessary.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the right upper extremity ultrasound did not show any DVT, it is still important to monitor the patient for"

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is stable from respiratory standpoint but
   active issues are now persistently altered mental status, difficulty
   clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore being kept on 30% FiO2
   with shovel mask.  He is still requiring Q3hr or more frequent
   suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to azithro/ceftriaxone out of
   fear of worsening mental status, now day 3 of 7 days.  No organisms on
   sputum.
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 3 of 7.
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Will give 40mg IV Lasix this am.
   - keep metoprolol at 25 mg PO QID and continue captopril 12.5mg TID to
   reduce afterload.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - continue frequent suctioning to clear secretions
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, though ICU admission alone in
   a man with baseline dementia could explain his severe delirium.
   Appreciate Neurology input who think he is encephalopathic and
   recommended MRI yesterday which is preliminarily negative.
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Tylenol first, then low dose fentanyl as needed for pain
   - Neuro recs if spikes new fever would need LP. Also watch for
   metabolic abnormalities, none apparent so far
   #) RUE swelling: ultrasound negative yesterday. Does have recent
   history of gout. Appear slightly improved.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday
   - Consider pulling arterial line
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs and PVCs. We are trying to control with
   metoprolol QID.
   - metoprolol 25 mg PO QID
   - increase as necessary
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - continue collar.  Ask ortho how much longer that will be necessary.
   - will need orthopedics followup
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.1
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - captopril 12.5mg TID and metoprolol 25mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:  continue home prednisone
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is stable from respiratory standpoint but
   active issues are now persistently altered mental status, difficulty
   clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore being kept on 30% FiO2
   with shovel mask.  He is still requiring Q3hr or more frequent
   suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to azithro/ceftriaxone out of
   fear of worsening mental status, now day 3 of 7 days.  No organisms on
   sputum.
   - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 3 of 7.
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Hold on giving Lasix this am though
   and f/u UOP later today
   - keep metoprolol at 25 mg PO QID and continue captopril 12.5mg TID to
   reduce afterload.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - continue frequent suctioning to clear secretions
 will need to touch
   base with family re: putting a trach in
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, though ICU admission alone in
   a man with baseline dementia could explain his severe delirium.
   Appreciate Neurology input who think he is encephalopathic and
   recommended MRI yesterday which is preliminarily negative.
   - Start standing Tylenol instead of prn to control his pain
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Neuro recs if spikes new fever would need LP. Also watch for
   metabolic abnormalities, none apparent so far.
   #) RUE swelling: ultrasound negative yesterday. Does have recent
   history of gout. Appear slightly improved.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday
   - Pulling arterial line today
   - Plain film of R hand
   #) Tachycardia:  Unclear etiology.  EKGs consistent with sinus
   tachycardia with frequent PACs and PVCs. We are trying to control with
   metoprolol QID.
   - Will increase Metoprolol 25 mg PO QID  to 37.5 QID
   #) Right wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for
   operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.1
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult.
   #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once, then follow-up
   - captopril 12.5mg TID and metoprolol 25mg QID
 increase as above
   - I/O goal
 even today
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:  continue home prednisone
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment days prior to admission and was transferred from the TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Currently, the patient is stable from a respiratory standpoint but has active issues including persistent altered mental status, difficulty clearing secretions, and right hand swelling. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and tachycardia. Although he is now stable, he still requires frequent suctioning to clear secretions and is being kept on 30% FiO2 with a shovel mask. 
2) Delirium: The patient continues to wax and wane quite a bit, with severe delirium. Neurology input is recommended, and an MRI was performed yesterday, which is preliminary negative.
3) Right Upper Extremity Swelling: The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity, which was negative on ultrasound yesterday. It could be related to gout or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4) Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia with frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Metoprolol is being"

   Total time spent: 32 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male who presented with respiratory failure following a fall and subsequent delirium. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation, as well as a fracture in the C2 vertebrae and a wrist fracture. 

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have secretions with difficulty clearing. He is currently on antibiotics (azithromycin and ceftriaxone) for respiratory infection.

2. C2 fracture: The patient has a fracture in the C2 vertebrae, and a cervical collar has been applied to stabilize the neck.

3. Right hand swelling: The patient has swelling in the right hand, which is negative on ultrasound. Plain film of the hand/wrist should be checked as well, and the radial arterial line should be pulled.

4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, and an MRI without acute changes was performed.

Other issues mentioned in the note include impaired transfers, impaired gait, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, and impaired knowledge. These impairments are likely related to the patient's overall critical condition and age.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory failure, fractures, delirium, and other medical complications."

 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now persistently altered mental
   status, difficulty clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore alternating between 30%
   FiO2 with shovel mask and regular face mask.  He is still requiring
   Q3hr or more frequent suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to
   azithro/ceftriaxone out of fear of worsening mental status, now day 4
   of 7 days, and Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt was febrile and had AF
   with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 4 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Was 2L positive through yesterday,
   will give 40mg IV Lasix today
   - Increased Metoprolol yesterday to 37.5 qid and kept Captopril 12.5
   TID --> will need to watch HR and BP today with new onset AF with RVR
   and increase as tolerated if necessary
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - From a respiratory status, he appears pretty good today, satting well
   on humidified facemask and occasional shovel mask
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Appreciate Neurology input who think he is encephalopathic and
   recommended MRI which was negative for any acute process.
   - They also recommended that if he spikes new fever which he did
   yesterday, may need LP.
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   - F/u neuro recs
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Have d/c
d Levaquin which may have been contributing to delirium
   - Need to assess med list and d/c unnecessary meds
   #) New fevers--Unsure of the source. Pt was afebrile for quite a while
   then spiked yesterday to 102.
   - F/u Cx's from when he spiked last night
   - Would re-Cx if spikes
   - Recent imaging includes CXR's with L retrocardiac opacity, called as
   atelectasis previously. Last CT chest with B opacities concern for PNA
   vs atelectasis. MRI head negative. Could consider CT torso to look for
   infection, but likely low yield
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone and now added Vanc
   #) RUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT. Does have recent history
   of gout. Appear slightly improved.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday, hesitant to increase in already
   delirious pt
   - Pulled art line from R hand yesterday
   - Plain films of R hand without prelim reads --> follow up today
   - will consult hand surgery to evaluate for any fluid
   collection/abscess
   #) AFib with RVR: currently still in AFib but without RVR
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Will restart anticoagulation today with Coumadin
   #) Left wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.1
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult, but yesterday 2L
   positive, will give Lasix today
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen, currently outdates [**11-10**]
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
    #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once today, then follow-up
   - captopril 12.5mg TID and metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:  continue home prednisone
   - Could consider increasing as R hand swelling possibly gout but pt is
   already delirious
   - Consider adding Colchicine if continues, possibly tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment days prior to admission and is currently in the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient has hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, difficulty clearing secretions, and right hand swelling. He also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, left wrist fracture, dens fracture, chronic kidney disease, anemia, congestive heart failure exacerbation, COPD, gout, and benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to his history of COPD and acute exacerbation. He requires frequent suctioning and has periodic drops in oxygen saturation levels, indicating ongoing respiratory compromise.

2. Delirium: The patient continues to exhibit delirium, characterized by waxing and waning mental status. This could be due to hospital/ICU delirium, infection, or other underlying causes. Neurology input is recommended, and an MRI was done, which was negative for any acute process.

3. Fever: The patient has had fevers despite being afebrile for a while. The source of the fever is unknown, and recent cultures have been negative. Imaging shows atelectasis and bilateral opacities on the chest, raising concerns for pneumonia"

 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is stable from respiratory standpoint but
   active issues are now persistently altered mental status, difficulty
   clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore alternating between 30%
   FiO2 with shovel mask and regular face mask.  He is still requiring
   Q3hr or more frequent suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to
   azithro/ceftriaxone out of fear of worsening mental status, now day 4
   of 7 days, and Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt was febrile and had AF
   with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 4 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Was 2L positive through yesterday,
   will give IV Lasix today
   - Increased Metoprolol yesterday to 37.5 qid and kept Captopril 12.5
   TID --> will need to watch HR and BP today with new onset AF with RVR
   and increase as tolerated if necessary
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - continue frequent suctioning to clear secretions and will need to
   touch base with family re: putting a trach in
   - Will need family meeting to discuss the trach and also goals of care
   given frequent suctioning and continued respiratory needs
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, though ICU admission alone in
   a man with baseline dementia could explain his severe delirium.
   - Appreciate Neurology input who think he is encephalopathic and
   recommended MRI yesterday which was negative for any acute process.
   - They also recommended that if he spikes new fever which he did
   yesterday, would need LP, which we can discuss on rounds today.
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance has been positive, and there have been concerns about his electrolyte levels. IV Lasix will be given today to address this issue.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been experiencing frequent delirium, with waxing and waning consciousness. Neurology input has been requested, and an MRI was performed, which showed no acute process. The patient is currently febrile, and further cultures are pending.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is now being managed with oxygen supplementation and frequent suctioning. A tracheostomy may be considered due to the continued respiratory needs.
4. Right Upper Extremity Swelling: The patient has swelling in his right hand, which was initially suspected to be due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, an ultrasound ruled out DVT, and the swelling is currently being"

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now persistently altered mental
   status, difficulty clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypotension: patient dropped pressures yesterday after receiving
   lasix and captopril and took most of the day to recover, eventually
   receiving 1800ccs in boluses and running 4 liters positive for the
   day.  Today his pressures have improved, but we will stay away from
   captopril for awhile now, and run him even for several days before
   being more aggressive in our diuresis.  Given his tachycardia, we will
   continue metoprolol.
   - metoprolol 37.5mg TID.  No captopril
   - goal I/O
s even.
   #) AFib with RVR: currently still in AFib but without RVR.  Alternates
   between A fib and sinus rhythm w/ frequent PACs and PVCs.  Given the
   hypotension above, we will try to control his rate with digoxin in the
   hope of controlling tachycardia without dropping his pressures.
   - PO digoxin load.  1 gram in first 24 hours, then 0.125mg daily.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Restarted anticoagulation yesterday with Coumadin.  Plan is to
   anticoagulate while he is hospitalized, but likely send him home
   without coumadin given his fall risk.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: His secretions have
   been improving.  Switched from levofloxacin to azithro/ceftriaxone out
   of fear of worsening mental status, now day 4 of 7 days, and Vanc was
   added [**2109-11-7**] when pt was febrile and had AF with RVR.  No recent
   organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 4 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Was 2L positive through yesterday,
   will give 40mg IV Lasix today
   - Increased Metoprolol yesterday to 37.5 qid and kept Captopril 12.5
   TID --> will need to watch HR and BP today with new onset AF with RVR
   and increase as tolerated if necessary
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - From a respiratory status, he appears pretty good today, satting well
   on humidified facemask and occasional shovel mask
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #)  Fevers: Unsure of the source. Pt was afebrile for quite a while
   then spiked yesterday to 102.
   - F/u Cx's from when he spiked last night
   - Would re-Cx if spikes
   - Recent imaging includes CXR's with L retrocardiac opacity, called as
   atelectasis previously. Last CT chest with B opacities concern for PNA
   vs atelectasis. MRI head negative. Could consider CT torso to look for
   infection, but likely low yield
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone and now added Vanc
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - F/u neuro recs.  No plan for LP for now.
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   #) RUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT. Does have recent history
   of gout. Appear slightly improved.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday, hesitant to increase in already
   delirious pt
   - Pulled art line from R hand yesterday
   - Plain films of R hand without prelim reads --> follow up today
   - will consult hand surgery to evaluate for any fluid
   collection/abscess
   #) Left wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.1
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult, but yesterday 2L
   positive, will give Lasix today
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen, currently outdates [**11-10**]
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
    #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once today, then follow-up
   - captopril 12.5mg TID and metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:  continue home prednisone
   - Could consider increasing as R hand swelling possibly gout but pt is
   already delirious
   - Consider adding Colchicine if continues, possibly tomorrow
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place

","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation (AFib), respiratory failure, upper extremity fracture, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. 

The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone, azithromycin, vancomycin, lasix, captopril, metoprolol, digoxin, prednisone, and albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers. 

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine level. 

Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with gout in the carpus, distal radius, and ulna, as well as a suspected nondisplaced fracture at the lunate and distal radius. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 100/24 to 124/34 mmHg, heart rate between 103 and 117 bpm, respiratory rate around 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further diagnostic tests and"

 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now persistently altered mental
   status, difficulty clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #)
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Appreciate Neurology input who think he is encephalopathic and
   recommended MRI which was negative for any acute process.
   - They also recommended that if he spikes new fever which he did
   yesterday, may need LP.
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   - F/u neuro recs
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Have d/c
d Levaquin which may have been contributing to delirium
   - Need to assess med list and d/c unnecessary meds
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore alternating between 30%
   FiO2 with shovel mask and regular face mask.  He is still requiring
   Q3hr or more frequent suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to
   azithro/ceftriaxone out of fear of worsening mental status, now day 4
   of 7 days, and Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt was febrile and had AF
   with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 4 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Was 2L positive through yesterday,
   will give 40mg IV Lasix today
   - Increased Metoprolol yesterday to 37.5 qid and kept Captopril 12.5
   TID --> will need to watch HR and BP today with new onset AF with RVR
   and increase as tolerated if necessary
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - From a respiratory status, he appears pretty good today, satting well
   on humidified facemask and occasional shovel mask
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #)  Fevers: Unsure of the source. Pt was afebrile for quite a while
   then spiked yesterday to 102.
   - F/u Cx's from when he spiked last night
   - Would re-Cx if spikes
   - Recent imaging includes CXR's with L retrocardiac opacity, called as
   atelectasis previously. Last CT chest with B opacities concern for PNA
   vs atelectasis. MRI head negative. Could consider CT torso to look for
   infection, but likely low yield
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone and now added Vanc
   #) RUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT. Does have recent history
   of gout. Appear slightly improved.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday, hesitant to increase in already
   delirious pt
   - Pulled art line from R hand yesterday
   - Plain films of R hand without prelim reads --> follow up today
   - will consult hand surgery to evaluate for any fluid
   collection/abscess
   #) AFib with RVR: currently still in AFib but without RVR
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Will restart anticoagulation today with Coumadin
   #) Left wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.1
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult, but yesterday 2L
   positive, will give Lasix today
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen, currently outdates [**11-10**]
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
    #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once today, then follow-up
   - captopril 12.5mg TID and metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:  continue home prednisone
   - Could consider increasing as R hand swelling possibly gout but pt is
   already delirious
   - Consider adding Colchicine if continues, possibly tomorrow
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and transferred to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current issues include altered mental status, difficulty clearing secretions, and right hand swelling. The altered mental status is characterized by intermittent periods of confusion and disorientation, with fluctuating levels of consciousness. The patient's sons believe that he appears better at times but may be noncompliant with commands. 

The respiratory failure initially caused by acute on chronic heart failure, worsened by hypertension and tachycardia, is now primarily due to difficulty clearing secretions. The patient is still requiring frequent suctioning and is on supplemental oxygen. 

The right upper extremity swelling is believed to be related to gout, as confirmed by imaging, and is currently being managed with prednisone. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and is currently being treated with metoprolol and will restart anticoagulation with Coumadin.

Other medical conditions and complications include a dens fracture, left wrist fracture, chronic kidney disease, anemia, congestive heart failure exacerbation, and gout. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including"

   Chief Complaint: Altered mental status/multiple fractures
   24 Hour Events:
 SPUTUM CULTURE - At [**2109-11-8**] 11:12 AM
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2109-11-8**] 11:15 AM
   - Got Lasix and Captopril at same time around 2pm, then hypoTN to 70's,
   then given 250cc bolus, improved to 80's.
   - hypoTN through rest of afternoon, evening, night, but improved,
   received total of 1.75L through evening and by end of night bp's low
   100's, pulse low 100's. Moral of story --> probably didn't need
   diuresis, also need to be careful with bp meds.
   - Plastics came by. Final R hand Xray readings showing gout and also
   nondisplaced fx at lunate and distal radius. Splinted but not casted.
   Will need to f/u their recs
   - Spoke extensively with 2/3 sons. Everyone agreed he looked great
   today but he is inconsistent. Also a big element of his stubborness and
   basic noncompliance with everyone. So what we see as ""AMS"" may be he
   just doesn't want to open eyes and be responsive. They also did mention
   that he takes ""[**Doctor Last Name 10361**]"" at home and that if we stagger some NSAIDs in
   with the scheduled Tylenol, may be helpful.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment days prior to admission and had odontoid and right wrist fractures. He was transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. In the ICU, he is more stable from a respiratory standpoint but has active issues including persistently altered mental status, difficulty clearing secretions, and R hand swelling. The patient's current conditions and medical complications include electrolyte & fluid disorder, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), upper extremity fracture, and impaired gait, balance, knowledge, transfers, and aerobic capacity/endurance. The patient's recent lab results show some abnormalities such as elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with gout in the carpus, distal radius, and ulna, and fifth metacarpal head, suspected nondisplaced fracture at the lunate and distal radius, and negative MRI head. The patient has multiple medical problems and is currently being treated with various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, anticoagulants, and medications for COPD and heart failure. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory status, delirium"

 SPUTUM CULTURE - At [**2109-11-8**] 11:12 AM
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2109-11-8**] 11:15 AM
   - Got Lasix and Captopril at same time around 2pm, then hypoTN to 70's,
   then given 250cc bolus, improved to 80's.
   - hypoTN through rest of afternoon, evening, night, but improved,
   received total of 1.75L through evening and by end of night bp's low
   100's, pulse low 100's. Moral of story --> probably didn't need
   diuresis, also need to be careful with bp meds.
   - Plastics came by. Final R hand Xray readings showing gout and also
   nondisplaced fx at lunate and distal radius. Splinted but not casted.
   Will need to f/u their recs
   - Spoke extensively with 2/3 sons. Everyone agreed he looked great
   today but he is inconsistent. Also a big element of his stubborness and
   basic noncompliance with everyone. So what we see as ""AMS"" may be he
   just doesn't want to open eyes and be responsive. They also did mention
   that he takes ""[**Doctor Last Name 10361**]"" at home and that if we stagger some NSAIDs in
   with the scheduled Tylenol, may be helpful.

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now persistently altered mental
   status, difficulty clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore alternating between 30%
   FiO2 with shovel mask and regular face mask.  He is still requiring
   Q3hr or more frequent suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to
   azithro/ceftriaxone out of fear of worsening mental status, now day 4
   of 7 days, and Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt was febrile and had AF
   with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 4 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Was 2L positive through yesterday,
   will give 40mg IV Lasix today
   - Increased Metoprolol yesterday to 37.5 qid and kept Captopril 12.5
   TID --> will need to watch HR and BP today with new onset AF with RVR
   and increase as tolerated if necessary
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - From a respiratory status, he appears pretty good today, satting well
   on humidified facemask and occasional shovel mask
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Appreciate Neurology input who think he is encephalopathic and
   recommended MRI which was negative for any acute process.
   - They also recommended that if he spikes new fever which he did
   yesterday, may need LP.
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   - F/u neuro recs
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Have d/c
d Levaquin which may have been contributing to delirium
   - Need to assess med list and d/c unnecessary meds
   #) New fevers--Unsure of the source. Pt was afebrile for quite a while
   then spiked yesterday to 102.
   - F/u Cx's from when he spiked last night
   - Would re-Cx if spikes
   - Recent imaging includes CXR's with L retrocardiac opacity, called as
   atelectasis previously. Last CT chest with B opacities concern for PNA
   vs atelectasis. MRI head negative. Could consider CT torso to look for
   infection, but likely low yield
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone and now added Vanc
   #) RUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT. Does have recent history
   of gout. Appear slightly improved.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday, hesitant to increase in already

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment days prior to admission and was transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently more stable from a respiratory standpoint but has active issues including altered mental status, difficulty clearing secretions, and right hand swelling.

Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has had ongoing fluid balance issues, with positive fluid balance yesterday and plans to give Lasix today.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to wax and wane quite a bit, with intermittent improvement. He is able to communicate with his sons but does not open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. No clear infectious source has been found, and he may have hospital/ICU delirium.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient is currently still in atrial fibrillation but without rapid ventricular response. Metoprolol was increased, and Coumadin will be restarted today.
4. Right Upper Extremity Swelling: The patient has swelling in his right upper extremity, which is slightly improved. An ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and he has a recent history of gout.
5. Left Wrist Fracture: The patient now has a reduced and casted left wrist fracture, with no plans for operative intervention.
6. Dens Fracture: The patient has a type II dens fracture, which is being managed non-operatively with a hard collar.
7. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's baseline creatinine is improved from 1.4-1.6 to 1.1.
8. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, currently at 23.5, possibly due to anemia of chronic disease.
9. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient may have had an exacerbation of end-stage diastolic heart failure complicated by severe aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
10. COPD: The patient's COPD history is unclear, with CO2 retention at baseline and home oxygen use. Inhalers have been prescribed but not used at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gout: The patient may have gout contributing to his right hand swelling.
2. Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: The patient has a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy, currently on hold due to the presence of a foley catheter.
3. Pneumonia vs Atelectasis: There is concern for pneumonia versus atelectasis in the patient's chest imaging.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis: Although the ultrasound was negative, there is still a possibility of deep vein thrombosis in the patient's right upper extremity.
5. Delirium: The patient may have hospital/ICU delirium or encephalopathy.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient may have acute respiratory failure, not ARDS.
7. Impaired Transfer: The patient may have impaired transfers and mobility.
8. Impaired Balance: The patient may have impaired balance.
9. Impaired Gait: The patient may have impaired gait.
10. Impaired Knowledge: The patient may have impaired knowledge.

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now persistently altered mental
   status, difficulty clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypotension: patient dropped pressures yesterday after receiving
   lasix and captopril and took most of the day to recover, eventually
   receiving 1800ccs in boluses and running 4 liters positive for the
   day.  Today his pressures have improved, but we will stay away from
   captopril for awhile now, and run him even for several days before
   being more aggressive in our diuresis.  Given his tachycardia, we will
   continue metoprolol.
   - metoprolol 37.5mg TID.  No captopril
   - goal I/O
s even.
   #) AFib with RVR: currently still in AFib but without RVR.  Alternates
   between A fib and sinus rhythm w/ frequent PACs and PVCs.  Given the
   hypotension above, we will try to control his rate with digoxin in the
   hope of controlling tachycardia without dropping his pressures.
   - PO digoxin load.  1 gram in first 24 hours, then 0.125mg daily.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Restarted anticoagulation yesterday with Coumadin.  Plan is to
   anticoagulate while he is hospitalized, but likely send him home
   without coumadin given his fall risk.
   #) RUE swelling: Plain-films showed a small fracture of his wrist which
   is the likely source of his swelling.  There were also signs of gout on
   the plain film, which could explain his leukocytosis and fever.  He was
   seen by plastics who splinted his hand.
   - f/u plastics recs.  Can also ask them whether they would be willing
   to tap a joint to check for gout.  If not them, consider a rheumatology
   consult.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday and consider increasing if we can
   prove acute gout with joint aspirate.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: His secretions have
   been improving and he is generally satting well with nasal cannula.  On
   day 5 of 7 of ceftriaxone/azithro with Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt
   was persistently febrile and had AF with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 5 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Will give lasix cautiously after
   hypotension above.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #)  Fevers: Patient is intermittently febrile without a clear source.
   Cultures have not grown anything to date, but he has persistently been
   on antibiotics.  He could have low-grade temps from gout.
   - F/u cultures
   - Would re-Cx if spikes
   - Recent imaging includes CXR's with L retrocardiac opacity, called as
   atelectasis previously. Last CT chest with B opacities concern for PNA
   vs atelectasis. MRI head negative.
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone and now added Vanc
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - F/u neuro recs.  No plan for LP for now.
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   #) Left wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 0.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult, but yesterday 2L
   positive, will give Lasix today
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen, currently outdates [**11-10**]
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
    #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place
   FEN: NG tube w/ tube feeds, replete electrolytes PRN
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin and pneumo boots, Pepcid
   Access: PICC line

   are very involved.  We may have to discuss PEG tube placement with them
   relatively soon.
   Disposition: Should begin rehab screening.  He would likely do better
   going to acute rehab than to the floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment prior to admission and had odontoid and right wrist fractures. He was transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Currently, he is more stable but has active issues including altered mental status, difficulty clearing secretions, and right hand swelling.

Medical Complications:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has shown hypotension, which improved after receiving Lasix and captopril. However, he took most of the day to recover and eventually received 1800ccs in boluses and ran 4 liters positive for the day. His pressures have improved, but caution is advised with diuresis due to his tachycardia. He will continue metoprolol and digoxin to control his rate.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is currently still in AFib but without RVR. He alternates between AFib and sinus rhythm with frequent PACs and PVCs. Digoxin is being started to control his rate, and metoprolol will continue to be used.

3. Right Upper Extremity Swelling: Plain-films showed a small fracture of the wrist, which is the likely source of swelling. There were also signs"

 SPUTUM CULTURE - At [**2109-11-8**] 11:12 AM
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2109-11-8**] 11:15 AM
   - Got Lasix and Captopril at same time around 2pm, then hypoTN to 70's,
   then given 250cc bolus, improved to 80's.
   - hypoTN through rest of afternoon, evening, night, but improved,
   received total of 1.75L through evening and by end of night bp's low
   100's, pulse low 100's. Moral of story --> probably didn't need
   diuresis, also need to be careful with bp meds.
   - Plastics came by. Final R hand Xray readings showing gout and also
   nondisplaced fx at lunate and distal radius. Splinted but not casted.
   Will need to f/u their recs
   - Spoke extensively with 2/3 sons. Everyone agreed he looked great

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now persistently altered mental
   status, difficulty clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Initially caused by
   acute on chronic heart failure worsened by hypertension and
   tachycardia, though now his primary problem is his difficulty clearing
   secretions.  While his O2 sats are generally in the mid to high 90s, he
   has periodic drops to the 80s and is therefore alternating between 30%
   FiO2 with shovel mask and regular face mask.  He is still requiring
   Q3hr or more frequent suctioning.  Switched from levofloxacin to
   azithro/ceftriaxone out of fear of worsening mental status, now day 4
   of 7 days, and Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt was febrile and had AF
   with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 4 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Was 2L positive through yesterday,
   will give 40mg IV Lasix today
   - Increased Metoprolol yesterday to 37.5 qid and kept Captopril 12.5
   TID --> will need to watch HR and BP today with new onset AF with RVR
   and increase as tolerated if necessary
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - From a respiratory status, he appears pretty good today, satting well
   on humidified facemask and occasional shovel mask
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Appreciate Neurology input who think he is encephalopathic and
   recommended MRI which was negative for any acute process.
   - They also recommended that if he spikes new fever which he did
   yesterday, may need LP.
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   - F/u neuro recs
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Have d/c
d Levaquin which may have been contributing to delirium
   - Need to assess med list and d/c unnecessary meds
   #) New fevers--Unsure of the source. Pt was afebrile for quite a while
   then spiked yesterday to 102.
   - F/u Cx's from when he spiked last night
   - Would re-Cx if spikes
   - Recent imaging includes CXR's with L retrocardiac opacity, called as
   atelectasis previously. Last CT chest with B opacities concern for PNA
   vs atelectasis. MRI head negative. Could consider CT torso to look for
   infection, but likely low yield
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone and now added Vanc
   #) RUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT. Does have recent history
   of gout. Appear slightly improved.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday, hesitant to increase in already
   delirious pt
   - Pulled art line from R hand yesterday
   - Plain films of R hand without prelim reads --> follow up today
   - will consult hand surgery to evaluate for any fluid
   collection/abscess
   #) AFib with RVR: currently still in AFib but without RVR
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Will restart anticoagulation today with Coumadin
   #) Left wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.1
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult, but yesterday 2L
   positive, will give Lasix today
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen, currently outdates [**11-10**]
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
    #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - lasix 40 mg IV once today, then follow-up
   - captopril 12.5mg TID and metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Gout:  continue home prednisone
   - Could consider increasing as R hand swelling possibly gout but pt is
   already delirious
   - Consider adding Colchicine if continues, possibly tomorrow
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and transferred to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. His current active issues include altered mental status, difficulty clearing secretions, and right hand swelling.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure due to underlying lung disease and complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be attributed to various causes such as medication side effects, infection, or ICU delirium. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed.
3. Infection: The patient has fevers and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of heart failure and aortic insufficiency. There is a risk of exacerbation of heart failure due to fluid management issues or arrhythmias.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function due to fluid balance issues or medications.
6. Gout: The patient"

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now persistently altered mental
   status, difficulty clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #)  Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient is intermittently febrile and now has
   a rising leukocytosis.  Cultures have not grown anything to date, but
   he has persistently been on antibiotics.  This could be from gout.  Has
   been c diff negative.\
   - consider rheum consult
   - F/u cultures
   - Would re-Cx if spikes
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone and now added Vanc
   #) Hypotension: patient dropped pressures yesterday after receiving
   lasix and captopril and took most of the day to recover, eventually
   receiving 1800ccs in boluses and running 4 liters positive for the
   day.  Today his pressures have improved, but we will stay away from
   captopril for awhile now, and run him even for several days before
   being more aggressive in our diuresis.  Given his tachycardia, we will
   continue metoprolol.
   - metoprolol 37.5mg TID.  No captopril
   - goal I/O
s even.
   #) AFib with RVR: currently still in AFib but without RVR.  Alternates
   between A fib and sinus rhythm w/ frequent PACs and PVCs.  Given the
   hypotension above, we will try to control his rate with digoxin in the
   hope of controlling tachycardia without dropping his pressures.
   - PO digoxin load.  1 gram in first 24 hours, then 0.125mg daily.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Restarted anticoagulation yesterday with Coumadin.  Plan is to
   anticoagulate while he is hospitalized, but likely send him home
   without coumadin given his fall risk.
   #) RUE swelling: Plain-films showed a small fracture of his wrist which
   is the likely source of his swelling.  There were also signs of gout on
   the plain film, which could explain his leukocytosis and fever.  He was
   seen by plastics who splinted his hand.
   - f/u plastics recs.  Can also ask them whether they would be willing
   to tap a joint to check for gout.  If not them, consider a rheumatology
   consult.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday and consider increasing if we can
   prove acute gout with joint aspirate.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: His secretions have
   been improving and he is generally satting well with nasal cannula.  On
   day 6 of 7 of ceftriaxone/azithro with Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt
   was persistently febrile and had AF with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 6 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Will give lasix cautiously after
   hypotension above.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #) Delerium: more interactive
   He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to communicate
   with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak to him he
   doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We have not
   found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU delirium.
   - F/u neuro recs.  No plan for LP for now.
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   #) Left wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 0.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult, but yesterday 2L

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment prior to admission and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently more stable from a respiratory standpoint but has active issues such as persistently altered mental status, difficulty clearing secretions, and right hand swelling.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in his electrolytes, including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-). There is also a concern for fluid overload, as indicated by the positive fluid balance.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has persistently altered mental status, which may be due to delirium or dementia. It is important to monitor for any changes in cognitive function and provide appropriate care.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and acute exacerbation, as well as previous respiratory failure. Monitoring oxygenation levels and ensuring adequate ventilation is crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.

4. Gout: The patient's leukocytosis and fever could be related to gout, as signs of gout were seen on plain films. Further evaluation and management of gout should be"

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now low grade fevers and leukocytosis
   of unclear origin.
   #)  Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient is intermittently febrile and now has
   a rising leukocytosis.  Cultures have not grown anything to date, but
   he has persistently been on antibiotics.  This could be from gout.  Has
   been c diff negative.  CXR appears unchanged.  LFTs normal.
   - consider rheum consult
   - F/u cultures, continue to re-culture if spikes.
   - recheck C.diff as he has had a long abx course.
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone/Vanc today day [**6-2**].
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.  Has
   been fluid positive for multiple days now and appears to have
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) AFib with RVR: currently still in AFib but without RVR.  Alternates
   between A fib and sinus rhythm w/ frequent PACs and PVCs.  Given the
   hypotension above, we will try to control his rate with digoxin in the
   hope of controlling tachycardia without dropping his pressures.
   - PO digoxin load.  1 gram in first 24 hours, then 0.125mg daily.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Restarted anticoagulation yesterday with Coumadin.  Plan is to
   anticoagulate while he is hospitalized, but likely send him home
   without coumadin given his fall risk.
   #) RUE swelling: Plain-films showed a small fracture of his wrist which
   is the likely source of his swelling.  There were also signs of gout on
   the plain film, which could explain his leukocytosis and fever.  He was
   seen by plastics who splinted his hand.
   - f/u plastics recs.  Can also ask them whether they would be willing
   to tap a joint to check for gout.  If not them, consider a rheumatology
   consult.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday and consider increasing if we can
   prove acute gout with joint aspirate.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: His secretions have
   been improving and he is generally satting well with nasal cannula.  On
   day 6 of 7 of ceftriaxone/azithro with Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt
   was persistently febrile and had AF with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 6 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Will give lasix cautiously after
   hypotension above.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #) Delerium: more interactive
   He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to communicate
   with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak to him he
   doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We have not
   found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU delirium.
   - F/u neuro recs.  No plan for LP for now.
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   #) Hypotension: resolved.  Will need close monitoring while being
   diuresed.
   #) Left wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 0.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult, but yesterday 2L
   positive, will give Lasix today
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen, currently outdates [**11-10**]
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now low grade fevers and leukocytosis
   of unclear origin.
   #)  Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient is intermittently febrile and now has
   a rising leukocytosis.  Cultures have not grown anything to date, but
   he has persistently been on antibiotics.  This could be from gout.  C
   diff negative yesterday.  CXR appears unchanged.  LFTs normal.
   Pathogens that we are not covering include pseudomonas, VRE and ESBL
   klebsiella.  For now we will stop azithro (completed course) and change
   ceftriaxone for zosyn for empiric coverage of pseudomonas and continue
   vancomycin for potential MRSA
   - rheum consult
   - F/u cultures, continue to re-culture if spikes.
   - he has had a left-sided pleural effusion for several days.  Consider
   tapping if persistently febrile.
   - recheck C.diff as he has had a long abx course.
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.  Will consider pulling
   if we can obtain other access.
   - Change to Vanc/Zosyn as above.
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.  Has
   been fluid positive for multiple days now and appears to have
   increasing effusion on CXR.  We will shoot for I/O even for now, and if
   he tolerates that well, can diurese further.
   - Already got Lasix 60mg IV this morning.  Can give 80mg today in the
   afternoon if pressures hold.
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) AFib with RVR: dig loaded.  Will check a PM level and then decide on
   a daily dose.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Restarted anticoagulation yesterday with Coumadin.  Plan is to
   anticoagulate while he is hospitalized, but likely send him home
   without coumadin given his fall risk.  Follow INR and titrate coumadin.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Has not had episodes of
   desaturation for several days but continues to require frequent
   suctioning.
    - Vanc/Zosyn as above.
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Will give lasix cautiously after
   hypotension above.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #) Delerium: more interactive the last couple of days but continues to
   wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to communicate with his sons and
   they think he has improved.  Almost definitely has hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Should continue working with PT.
   - Standing Tylenol for pain control.
   #) Hypotension: resolved.  Will need close monitoring while being
   diuresed.
   #) Left and right wrist fractures: Left side reduced and casted.  Right
   side splinted.  No plans for operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.0
   - trend creatinine
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place

   are very involved.  We may have to discuss PEG tube placement with them
   relatively soon.
   Disposition: Should begin rehab screening.  He would likely do better
   going to acute rehab than to the floor.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and transferred from the TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current issues include fevers/leukocytosis of unclear origin, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, delirium, hypotension, left and right wrist fractures, dens fracture, chronic kidney disease, anemia, COPD, and benign prostatic hypertrophy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, infection due to persistent leukocytosis and fever, further deterioration in mental status, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, and worsening renal function.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. This may involve optimizing respiratory support, managing fluid balance, administering appropriate antibiotics, and addressing any other acute issues that may arise. Additionally, long-term care considerations such as rehabilitation and nutritional support should also be taken into account."

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now persistently altered mental
   status, difficulty clearing secretions, R hand swelling.
   #) Hypotension: patient dropped pressures yesterday after receiving
   lasix and captopril and took most of the day to recover, eventually
   receiving 1800ccs in boluses and running 4 liters positive for the
   day.  Today his pressures have improved, but we will stay away from
   captopril for awhile now, and run him even for several days before
   being more aggressive in our diuresis.  Given his tachycardia, we will
   continue metoprolol.
   - metoprolol 37.5mg TID.  No captopril
   - goal I/O
s even.
   #) AFib with RVR: currently still in AFib but without RVR.  Alternates
   between A fib and sinus rhythm w/ frequent PACs and PVCs.  Given the
   hypotension above, we will try to control his rate with digoxin in the
   hope of controlling tachycardia without dropping his pressures.
   - PO digoxin load.  1 gram in first 24 hours, then 0.125mg daily.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Restarted anticoagulation yesterday with Coumadin.  Plan is to
   anticoagulate while he is hospitalized, but likely send him home
   without coumadin given his fall risk.
   #) RUE swelling: Plain-films showed a small fracture of his wrist which
   is the likely source of his swelling.  There were also signs of gout on
   the plain film, which could explain his leukocytosis and fever.  He was
   seen by plastics who splinted his hand.
   - f/u plastics recs.  Can also ask them whether they would be willing
   to tap a joint to check for gout.  If not them, consider a rheumatology
   consult.
   - Continue Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday and consider increasing if we can
   prove acute gout with joint aspirate.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: His secretions have
   been improving and he is generally satting well with nasal cannula.  On
   day 5 of 7 of ceftriaxone/azithro with Vanc was added [**2109-11-7**] when pt
   was persistently febrile and had AF with RVR.  No recent organisms.
    - ceftriaxone 1 gm Q24, azithromycin 500mg Q24 today day 5 of 7.
   - Vanc added [**11-7**] pm = day 1 --> will need ABx approval
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Will give lasix cautiously after
   hypotension above.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #)  Fevers: Patient is intermittently febrile without a clear source.
   Cultures have not grown anything to date, but he has persistently been
   on antibiotics.  He could have low-grade temps from gout.
   - F/u cultures
   - Would re-Cx if spikes
   - Recent imaging includes CXR's with L retrocardiac opacity, called as
   atelectasis previously. Last CT chest with B opacities concern for PNA
   vs atelectasis. MRI head negative.
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.
   - On Azithro/Ceftriaxone and now added Vanc
   #) Delerium: He continues to wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to
   communicate with his sons and they think he has improved, when we speak
   to him he doesn
t open his eyes and withdraws from noxious stimuli. We
   have not found a clear infectious source, may have hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - F/u neuro recs.  No plan for LP for now.
   - PT consult to evaulate deconditioning
   - Yesterday started standing Tylenol to try and control pain
   #) Left wrist fracture: Now reduced and casted.  No plans for operative
   intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 0.8.
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - goal today for I/Os is even to avoid further insult, but yesterday 2L
   positive, will give Lasix today
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - active type and screen, currently outdates [**11-10**]
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
    #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now low grade fevers and leukocytosis
   of unclear origin.
   #)  Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient is intermittently febrile and now has
   a rising leukocytosis.  Cultures have not grown anything to date, but
   he has persistently been on antibiotics.  This could be from gout.  C
   diff negative yesterday.  CXR appears unchanged.  LFTs normal.
   Pathogens that we are not covering include pseudomonas, VRE and ESBL
   klebsiella.  For now we will stop azithro (completed course) and change
   ceftriaxone for zosyn for empiric coverage of pseudomonas and continue
   vancomycin for potential MRSA
   - rheum consult
   - F/u cultures, continue to re-culture if spikes.
   - he has had a left-sided pleural effusion for several days.  Consider
   tapping if persistently febrile.
   - recheck C.diff as he has had a long abx course.
   - R PICC was just placed so not likely source.  Will consider pulling
   if we can obtain other access.
   - Change to Vanc/Zosyn as above.
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.  Has
   been fluid positive for multiple days now and appears to have
   increasing effusion on CXR.  We will shoot for I/O even for now, and if
   he tolerates that well, can diurese further.
   - Already got Lasix 60mg IV this morning.  Can give 80mg today in the
   afternoon if pressures hold.
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) AFib with RVR: dig loaded.  Will check a PM level and then decide on
   a daily dose.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Restarted anticoagulation yesterday with Coumadin.  Plan is to
   anticoagulate while he is hospitalized, but likely send him home
   without coumadin given his fall risk.  Follow INR and titrate coumadin.
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Has not had episodes of
   desaturation for several days but continues to require frequent
   suctioning.
    - Vanc/Zosyn as above.
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Will give lasix cautiously after
   hypotension above.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #) Delerium: more interactive the last couple of days but continues to
   wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to communicate with his sons and
   they think he has improved.  Almost definitely has hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Should continue working with PT.
   - Standing Tylenol for pain control.
   #) Hypotension: resolved.  Will need close monitoring while being
   diuresed.
   #) Left and right wrist fractures: Left side reduced and casted.  Right
   side splinted.  No plans for operative intervention.
   - orthopedics followup
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.0
   - trend creatinine
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events: Increasing leukocytosis to 22.   Still with copious respiratory
   secretions, may be increased.
   Dig loaded yesterday.  Seen by OT
 R arm brace placed.
   VS T100.1
   I/O 2.9L positive.

   RR28 90% on NC.
   On exam: eyes closed, lying in bed, ronchorous breath sounds.  Neck
   collar in place.
   [**Last Name (un) **] S1 S2 [**2-1**] sys and diastolic murmurs.  Abd soft +BS.   Increased
   edema in B/L LE and RUE (splinted).
   Labs notable for WBC as above, stable Hct, Cr.  Bicarb 36 (33-37 in
   recent days).
   Meds include Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Azithro.
   CXR: worsening L effusion, L retrocardiac infiltrate.
   89 y/o with valvular CHF/COPD/chronic aspiration on intermittent oxygen
   s/p fall with C2 and wrist fx. MICU for acute-on-chronic hypercarbic
   resp failure.  Extubated ~1 week ago but persistent problems with
   encephalopathy and secretion management.
   Overall appears unchanged, though new leukocytosis concerning.  Will
   check diff, recheck sputum cultures, and empirically broaden
   antibiotics for resistant GNR given secretions and persistent /
   worsening LLL infiltrate.  If WBC persistents, consider thoracentesis
   (if effusion large enough on U/S).  Will consider d/c
ing PICC despite
   neg cx if able to get sufficient PIVs.
   While covered broadly, gout in differential, agree with getting Rheum
   opinion and possible tap.
   Regarding his resp status, more edematous today, and worsened effusion
   may reflect that; will need diuresis.
   Would check routine ABG given difficult to assess mental status.  Still
   needs frequent suctioning.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill.  Total time: 35 min

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living area and transferred to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been more stable from a respiratory standpoint but now presents with low-grade fevers and leukocytosis of unclear origin. He has a history of gout, which could be a potential cause of the symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's intermittent fevers and rising leukocyte count may indicate an infection. Since cultures have not grown anything to date, broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically. The patient's rheumatology consult is pending to rule out gout as the cause of the fever and leukocytosis.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF complicated by severe AR (aortic regurgitation) and moderate MR (mitral regurgitation) is concerning. Fluid resuscitation and holding home medications have exacerbated his condition, leading to an increasing effusion on the chest X-ray. The plan is to aim for an even fluid balance and diurese further if tolerated.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Digoxin has been loaded, and a"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - rheum saw patient and believe he has gout flare.  Tapped knee and
   will have to f/u labs sent.  Also, start colchicine and hold on
   allopurinol.
   -Very edematous yesterday, ordered standing lasix doses as fluid
   overload prohibiting resp improvement.  Lasix 40mg IV BID.  His home
   dose is 120mg PO.  Need a little higher to improve fluid overload.
   - Mucinex to help with secretion thinning.
   - Vanc trough was low, so changed from qd to [**Hospital1 **] dosing.

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 UPPER EXTREMITY FRACTURE (SHOULDER, HUMERAL, RADIAL, ULNAR, HAND)
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now low grade fevers and leukocytosis
   of unclear origin.
   #)  Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient is intermittently febrile and now has
   a rising leukocytosis.  Cultures have not grown anything to date, but
   he has persistently been on antibiotics.  This could be from gout.  C
   diff negative yesterday.  CXR appears unchanged.  LFTs normal.  Has
   completed a course of Azithro, and have changed Ceftriaxone to Zosyn
   (empiric coverage of Pseudomonas), and continuing Vanco (for MRSA
   coverage).
   - Continuing Vanc/Zosyn
   -  F/u cultures, continue to re-culture if spikes.
   - Needs new sputum Cx as the last one was inadequate
   - Continue Tx for gout with Prednisone and have now started Colchicine
   - He has had a left-sided pleural effusion for several days.  Consider
   tapping if persistently febrile.
   - R PICC was just placed [**2109-11-4**] so not likely source.  Will consider
   pulling if we can obtain other access.
   - Would add Flagyl for anaerobes if persistently febrile and no source
   becomes apparent
   - Will give a trial of stopping Tylenol today and see how his fever
   curve trends out
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.  We
   will shoot for I/O even for now, and if he tolerates that well, can
   diurese further. Was about 600 cc's up through yesterday and is approx
   13L positive through [**Location **] Have started Lasix 40 IV bid
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
 even today, with Lasix as above
   #) AFib with RVR: dig loaded, level was 1.8 yesterday pm, only getting
   dosed every day. Will discuss on rounds starting on qday dosing.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Restarted anticoagulation yesterday with Coumadin.  Plan is to
   anticoagulate while he is hospitalized, but likely send him home
   without coumadin given his fall risk.  Follow INR and titrate coumadin.
   - F/u coags this am
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Has not had episodes of
   desaturation for several days but continues to require frequent
   suctioning.
    - Vanc/Zosyn as above.
   - goal fluid balance even today.  Will give lasix cautiously after
   hypotension above.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   #) Delerium: more interactive the last couple of days but continues to
   wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to communicate with his sons and
   they think he has improved.  Almost definitely has hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Should continue working with PT.
   - Standing Tylenol for pain control
 will give a trial off Tylenol
   today to assess fevers
   #) Gout: Rheum consulted and tapped knee, fluid is consistent with
   gout. Could explain low grade fevers, increased WBC count.
   - Continues on Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday and we are hesitant to increase
   this further, pt already with delirium and possible infection
   - Started Colchicine yesterday
   #) Hypotension: resolved.  Will need close monitoring while being
   diuresed.
   #) Left and right wrist fractures: Left side reduced and casted.  Right
   side splinted.  No plans for operative intervention.
   - will recontact ortho to take a look at the L cast which appears to be
   sliding off
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.1
   - trend creatinine
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing
   #) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: holding agents while he has foley in
   place
   FEN: NG tube w/ tube feeds, replete electrolytes PRN
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin and pneumo boots, Pepcid
   Access: PICC line
   Code:  Full (discussed with son)
   Communication: Patient, son [**Name (NI) 3080**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10783**].  All three sons
   are very involved.  We may have to discuss PEG tube placement with them
   relatively soon.
   Disposition: Should begin rehab screening.  He would likely do better
   going to acute rehab than to the floor.
","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and had odontoid and right wrist fractures. The patient was transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Currently, he is more stable from a respiratory standpoint but has active issues of low-grade fevers and leukocytosis of unclear origin.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, impaired transfers, gait, aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, and knowledge.

Assessment and plan:
1) Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient is intermittently febrile and has a rising leukocytosis. Cultures have not grown anything to date, but he has persistently been on antibiotics. This could be due to gout. C. diff negative yesterday. CXR appears unchanged. LFTs normal. Has completed a course of Azithro, and have changed Ceftriaxone to Zosyn (empiric coverage of Pseudomonas), and continuing Vanco (for MRSA coverage).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure. He was found down in his living apartment and was transferred from the TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's active issues now include low-grade fevers and leukocytosis of unclear origin. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient is intermittently febrile and has a rising leukocytosis. Cultures have not grown anything to date, but he has persistently been on antibiotics. This could be due to gout. C diff negative yesterday. CXR appears unchanged. LFTs normal. He has completed a course of Azithro, and the Ceftriaxone has been changed to Zosyn (empiric coverage of Pseudomonas), and continuing Vanco (for MRSA coverage).

2. Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end-stage diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications. We will aim for I/O even today, with Lasix as above.

3. AFib with RVR: Dig loaded, level was 1.8 yesterday pm, only getting dosed every day. Will discuss on rounds starting on qday dosing.

4. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Has not had episodes of desaturation for several days but continues to require frequent suctioning.

5. Delirium: More interactive the last couple of days but continues to wax and wane quite a bit. He is able to communicate with his sons and they think he has improved. Almost definitely has hospital/ICU delirium.

6. Hypotension: Resolved. Will need close monitoring while being diuresed.

7. Left and right wrist fractures: Left side reduced and casted. Right side splinted. No plans for operative intervention.

8. Dens Fracture: Type II dens fracture. Non-operative. Currently in [Location] J Collar.

9. Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6. Currently improved to 1.0

10. Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.5. Had large bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since. Appears on labs to be anemia of chronic disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gout flare: The patient's low-grade fevers and leukocytosis could be due to a gout flare. It is important to continue monitoring his symptoms and lab results.

2. Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation: The patient's history of congestive heart failure and the presence of severe AR and moderate MR increase the risk of exacerbation. Close monitoring of his fluid balance and use of diuretics are necessary.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and acute respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications. Frequent suctioning and close monitoring of oxygenation are important.

4. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status suggests ongoing delirium. Close monitoring and involvement of the physical therapy department are crucial for his care.

5. Fractures: The patient has left and right wrist fractures, which require appropriate management, including splinting and potential casting.

6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease needs ongoing monitoring, especially considering his recent improvement in creatinine levels.

7. Anemia: The patient's anemia of chronic disease should be monitored, and appropriate interventions may be necessary.

Potential Medical Complications in ICU:
1. Fluid overload: The patient's history of congestive heart failure and recent fluid resuscitation increase the risk of fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuretic therapy are important.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and acute respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications in the ICU.

3. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status suggests ongoing delirium in the ICU. Close monitoring and involvement of the physical therapy department are crucial for his care.

4. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and leukocytosis indicate a possible ongoing infection. Close monitoring of lab results and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

5. Bleeding: The patient's history of a large bleed from the fem line site raises concern for bleeding complications in the ICU.

6. Hypotension: The patient's recent resolution of hypotension should be closely monitored, especially during diuresis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now low grade fevers, leukocytosis of
   unclear origin, and delirium.
   .
   #)  Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient is intermittently febrile and now has
   a rising leukocytosis.  Cultures have not grown anything to date, but
   he has persistently been on antibiotics.  This could be from gout.  C
   diff NTD and pending from this morning.  CXR appears unchanged.  LFTs
   normal.  Has completed a course of Azithro, and have changed to Zosyn
   (empiric coverage of Pseudomonas), and continuing Vanco (for MRSA
   coverage).
   - Continuing Vanc/Zosyn for a [**7-3**] day course
   - F/u cultures, continue to re-culture if spikes (all are NTD, sputum
   culture is contaminated)
   - Needs new sputum Cx as the last one was inadequate
   - Rheum recommends  Colchicine for gout treatment; no steroids at this
   time- need to touch base with them about stopping prednisone.
   - Stopped tylenol and was afebrile; continue Tylenol for pain
   .
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - Have started Lasix 40 IV bid
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
euvolemia to negative
   .
   #) AFib with RVR: dig loaded, level was 1.8 yesterday pm, only getting
   dosed every day. Will discuss on rounds starting on qday dosing.  Now
   in sinus rhythm
   - need EKG to confirm in sinus rhythm
   - Dose with digoxin today; was held yesterday d/t 1.8 Dig level.  Need
   to talk to pharm about recs
   - Metoprolol as above
   - INR very high yesterday, will convert and stop coumadin.
   - F/u coags this am
   .
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Has not had episodes of
   desaturation for several days but continues to require frequent
   suctioning.
   - Vanc/Zosyn as above.
   - diuresis
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Delerium: more interactive the last couple of days but continues to
   wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to communicate with his sons and
   they think he has improved.  Almost definitely has hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Should continue working with PT.
   - Standing Tylenol for pain control
 will give a trial off Tylenol to
   assess fevers
   - no benzos or other altering medications
   .
   #) Gout: Rheum consulted and tapped knee, fluid is consistent with
   gout. Could explain low grade fevers, increased WBC count.
   - Continues on Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday and we are hesitant to increase
   this further, pt already with delirium and possible infection
   - Started Colchicine yesterday
   - Has been on prednisone despite rheum recs not to be on it, will
   discuss with rheum today
   .
   #) Hypotension: resolved.  Will need close monitoring while being
   diuresed.
   .
   #) Left and right wrist fractures: Left side reduced and casted.  Right
   side splinted.  No plans for operative intervention.
   - will recontact ortho to take a look at the L cast which appears to be
   sliding off
   .
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]
   - Q4H neurologic checks
   .
   #) Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Currently
   improved to 1.1
   - trend creatinine
   .
    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.3.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21
   .
   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing

- He has benign prostatic hypertrophy and is holding agents while he has a foley in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's intermittent fevers and rising leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection. Continued monitoring and re-culture are necessary to identify the source of infection.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and exacerbation of end-stage diastolic heart failure pose a risk for fluid overload and worsening cardiac function. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis is essential.
3. Gout: The patient's gout can lead to acute flares and potential complications such as kidney stones or renal dysfunction. Monitoring his uric acid levels and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
4. Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of CO2 retention and dependence on supplemental oxygen puts him at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium increases the risk of falls, complications, and prolonged hospitalization. Frequent reorientation, appropriate pain management, and minimizing unnecessary medications are essential.
6. Fractures: The patient's multiple fractures, including the odontoid and wrist fractures, may lead to complications such as nonunion, malunion, or pressure ulcers. Regular orthopedic follow-up and proper immobilization are necessary."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with an altered mental status following a fall. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. 

From the 24-hour events section of the progress note, it is mentioned that the patient's free water intake has been decreased to 100 mL Q6. The patient is also being cultured for rising leukocytosis and continues to receive Vanc/Zosyn. Colchicine has been increased to once a day, as per rheumatology's recommendation. Orthopedics will recast the left arm and will need follow-up plain film after it has been ordered. Tylenol holiday has been implemented to avoid masking a fever, but the patient received 1 gm at 4 pm for pain. The patient remains afebrile throughout the day. At 4 pm, the patient's electrolytes showed an increase in bicarbonate levels from 33 to 37, otherwise remaining mostly unchanged. There was a significant jump in the INR from 2.0 yesterday to 12.3 today, prompting the discontinuation of Coumadin and subQ heparin.

In terms of allergies, the patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on [**2109-11-9**] at 12:21 PM (ceftriaxone) and 4:21 PM (azithromycin), on [**2109-11-11**] at 8:00 PM (vancomycin), and on [**2109-11-12**] at 6:00 AM (Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Zosyn).

The patient is receiving various infusions including heparin sodium (prophylaxis) starting on [**2109-11-11**] at 8:25 AM, and furosemide (Lasix) starting on [**2109-11-11**] at 8:00 PM. Other medications being administered include ICU medications and other medications, but specific details are not provided in the given information.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data as of [**2109-11-12**] 07:07 AM provides details on vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings. The patient's maximum temperature recorded was 37.2 degrees Celsius, with the current temperature being 36.4 degrees Celsius. Heart rate is within normal range, blood pressure is slightly elevated, respiratory rate is normal, and oxygen saturation is at 91%. The patient's weight has increased from 66 kg at admission to 67.1 kg currently. Total fluid input is 3,477 mL, with 819 mL being IV fluids. Total fluid output is 2,750 mL, with 940 mL being urine output. 

The patient is on aerosol-cool face tent for"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
   hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency and
   congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **] days
   prior to admission.  Here he was found to have odontoid and right wrist
   fractures, transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Here he is more stable from respiratory
   standpoint but active issues are now low grade fevers, leukocytosis of
   unclear origin, and delirium.
   .
   #)  Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient is intermittently febrile and now has
   a rising leukocytosis.  Cultures have not grown anything to date, but
   he has persistently been on antibiotics.  This could be from gout.  C
   diff NTD and pending from this morning.  CXR appears unchanged.  LFTs
   normal.  Has completed a course of Azithro, and have changed to Zosyn
   (empiric coverage of Pseudomonas), and continuing Vanco (for MRSA
   coverage).
   - Continuing Vanc/Zosyn
   -  F/u cultures, continue to re-culture if spikes (all are NTD, sputum
   culture is contaminated)
   - Needs new sputum Cx as the last one was inadequate
   - Rheum recommends  Colchicine for gout treatment; no steroids at this
   time.
   - He has had a left-sided pleural effusion for several days.  Consider
   tapping if persistently febrile.
   - R PICC was just placed [**2109-11-4**] so not likely source.  Will consider
   pulling if we can obtain other access.
   - Would add Flagyl for anaerobes if persistently febrile and no source
   becomes apparent
   - Stopped tylenol and was afebrile
   .
   #) Congestive Heart Failure: Concern for exacerbation of end stage
   diastolic heart failure complicated by severe AR and moderate MR in the
   setting of IV fluid resuscitation and holding home medications.
   - Have started Lasix 40 IV bid
   - metoprolol 37.5 mg QID
   - I/O goal
   .
   #) AFib with RVR: dig loaded, level was 1.8 yesterday pm, only getting
   dosed every day. Will discuss on rounds starting on qday dosing.
   - Dose with digoxin today; was held yesterday d/t 1.8 Dig level
   - Metoprolol as above
   - INR very high yesterday, will convert and stop coumadin.
   - F/u coags this am
   .
   #) Hypoxic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Has not had episodes of
   desaturation for several days but continues to require frequent
   suctioning.
   - Vanc/Zosyn as above.
   - diuresis
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
   - titrate O2 as needed to maintain sats.
   - Continue as is, try to wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Delerium: more interactive the last couple of days but continues to
   wax and wane quite a bit.  He is able to communicate with his sons and
   they think he has improved.  Almost definitely has hospital/ICU
   delirium.
   - Should continue working with PT.
   - Standing Tylenol for pain control
 will give a trial off Tylenol to
   assess fevers
   - no benzos or other altering medications
   .
   #) Gout: Rheum consulted and tapped knee, fluid is consistent with
   gout. Could explain low grade fevers, increased WBC count.
   - Continues on Prednisone 2.5mg PO qday and we are hesitant to increase
   this further, pt already with delirium and possible infection
   - Started Colchicine yesterday
   - Has been on prednisone despite rheum recs not to be on it, will
   discuss with team today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: resolved.  Will need close monitoring while being
   diuresed.
   .
   #) Left and right wrist fractures: Left side reduced and casted.  Right
   side splinted.  No plans for operative intervention.
   - will recontact ortho to take a look at the L cast which appears to be
   sliding off
   .
   #) Dens Fracture:  [**Last Name (un) 10782**] Type II dens fracture.  Non-operative.
   Currently in [**Location (un) 2420**] J Collar.
   - Touched base with orthopedics who said needs to keep on 6-8wks from
   injury and then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10823**]

    #) Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in the high 30s, today 23.3.  Had large
   bleed several days ago from fem line site, none since.  Appears on labs
   to be anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend hematocrit with transfusion goal < 21

   #) COPD: Unclear history.  Patient has a history of CO2 retention at
   baseline and uses home oxygen at 2L.  He does not take inhalers at home
   but has been prescribed them in the past.  We are giving albuterol and
   ipratropium nebulizers standing

   Communication: Patient, son [**Name (NI) 3080**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10783**].  All three sons
   are very involved.  We may have to discuss PEG tube placement with them
   relatively soon.
   Disposition: Should begin rehab screening.  He would likely do better
   going to acute rehab than to the floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, aortic insufficiency, and congestive heart failure.
- He was found down in his living apartment days prior to admission and had odontoid and right wrist fractures.
- The patient transferred from TSICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently more stable.
- Active issues include low-grade fevers, leukocytosis of unclear origin, and delirium.
- The patient has been intermittently febrile and now has a rising leukocytosis. Cultures have not grown anything to date, but he has persistently been on antibiotics.
- He completed a course of Azithromycin and was changed to Zosyn (empiric coverage of Pseudomonas), and continuing Vancomycin (for MRSA coverage).
- The patient's left-sided pleural effusion needs to be tapped if persistently febrile.
- He will continue on Vanc/Zosyn, re-culture if spikes (all are NTD, sputum culture is contaminated), and needs a new sputum culture.
- Rheum recommends Colchicine for gout treatment; no steroids at this time.
- He has had a left-sided pleural effusion for several days. Consider tapping if persistently febrile.
- His congestive heart failure is a concern for exacerbation of end"
