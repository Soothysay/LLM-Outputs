   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 y/o M w/ emphysema, metastatic NSCLC, CAD, who p/w
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory: Pt with tight airways overnight and diffuse wheezing in
   the AM responsive to nebs.  Likely etiology is COPD flare with
   underlying severe lung disease [**12-26**] metastatic NSCLC.  Pt did not need
   BiPAP overnight but appeared to be working hard this AM.  Given
   bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan would consider PCP
   pneumonia in the setting of recent steroid use from chemotherapy.
   - Prednisone 60mg PO, nebulizers, Azithromycin for COPD
   - f/u sputum cxs
   - will c/s covering for possible PCP given elevated LDH and recent
   steroid use (only add if CT chest suggest PCP).
   - BNP only mildly elevated -> does not appear fluid overloaded on exam
   - f/u viral screen
   - Wean oxygen on venti mask.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Concerning for infection, possible complication of
   therapy with Alimta with superimposed infection.  Leukemia unlikely
   given normal smear.
   - Pan-culture including C. Diff.
   - Trend WBCs
   - c/s Heme/Onc consult re: possible role of Alimta in causing severe
   leukocytosis
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - hold beta-blockers given COPD flare
   - avoid hydralazine if possible given h/o TAA
   - start captopril
   .
   #CAD: Continue statin, give low dose aspirin 81mg daily.  Hold
   beta-blocker for now [**12-26**] COPD flare.
   .
   #Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Pt without abdominal pain or hypotension.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of emphysema, lung cancer, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presents with tachypnea and a COPD flare. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a heart rate of 88 bpm (normal range: 78-99 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 163/77 mmHg to 135/56 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (normal range: 23-30 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has diminished breath sounds with occasional wheezes and rare crackles. He is alert, oriented, and follows simple commands. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complication: The patient may have a COPD exacerbation or airway obstruction due to the presence of a lung mass. There are also bilateral ground-glass opacities on the CT scan, which raises suspicion for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or lymphangitic tumor spread. Drug toxicity from Alimta is also a possibility.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count is concerning for an infection, potentially a complication of Alimta therapy or superimposed on existing conditions.
3. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure, which requires management with antihypertensive medication"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure and lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for further management. Upon admission, his initial ABG results showed a pH of 7.45, indicating respiratory alkalosis. He was also found to have an elevated white blood cell count of 40.3 K/uL, suggesting an infection or inflammatory response. The patient's blood glucose level was elevated at 191 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia. His hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dL, which is below the normal range, indicating anemia. Other lab results showed elevated levels of creatinine (0.9 mg/dL), lactic acid (2.0 mmol/L), calcium (8.9 mg/dL), magnesium (2.2 mg/dL), and phosphate (5.0 mg/dL). The patient's vital signs were stable, with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 163/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool delivery device. He was receiving hydralazine infusion for blood pressure control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and current respiratory distress indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an infection or inflammatory response, which may lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 y/o M w/ emphysema, metastatic NSCLC, CAD, who p/w
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory: Pt with tight airways overnight and diffuse wheezing in
   the AM responsive to nebs.  Likely etiology is COPD flare with
   underlying severe lung disease [**12-26**] metastatic NSCLC.  Pt did not need
   BiPAP overnight but appeared to be working hard this AM.  Given
   bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan would consider PCP
   pneumonia in the setting of recent steroid use from chemotherapy.
   - Prednisone 60mg PO, nebulizers, Azithromycin for COPD
   - f/u sputum cxs
   - will c/s covering for possible PCP given elevated LDH and recent
   steroid use (only add if CT chest suggest PCP).
   - BNP only mildly elevated -> does not appear fluid overloaded on exam
   - f/u viral screen
   - Wean oxygen on venti mask.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Concerning for infection, possible complication of
   therapy with Alimta with superimposed infection.  Leukemia unlikely
   given normal smear.
   - Pan-culture including C. Diff.
   - Trend WBCs
   - c/s Heme/Onc consult re: possible role of Alimta in causing severe
   leukocytosis
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - hold beta-blockers given COPD flare
   - avoid hydralazine if possible given h/o TAA
   - start captopril
   .
   #CAD: Continue statin, give low dose aspirin 81mg daily.  Hold
   beta-blocker for now [**12-26**] COPD flare.
   .
   #Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Pt without abdominal pain or hypotension.
   Stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a stage IV NSCLC patient with symptoms of SOB and hypoxemia being treated for a COPD flare. They are currently in the ICU and receiving various medications including prednisone, azithromycin, nebulizers, and hydralazine. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea and slightly elevated blood pressure. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with total input and output. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40% and their ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, wheezing throughout the chest, and soft non-tender distended abdomen. Lab results show leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and prolonged PT/PTT/INR. Imaging shows emphysema, a right hilar mass, and an RRR nodule but no obvious pneumonia. The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress likely due to a COPD flare, malignancy with no acute issues, leukocytosis, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of COPD and current symptoms of SOB and hypoxemia suggest potential respiratory complications such as exacerbations of COPD, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to immunosuppression from cancer and prolonged ICU stay. There is evidence of leukocytosis, which may indicate an"

   #Respiratory: Pt with tight airways overnight and diffuse wheezing in
   the AM responsive to nebs.  Likely etiology is COPD flare with
   underlying severe lung disease [**12-26**] metastatic NSCLC.  Pt did not need
   BiPAP overnight but appeared to be working hard this AM.  Feels
   subjectively better and accessory muscle use has decreased.  Given
   bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan would consider PCP
   pneumonia in the setting of recent steroid use from chemotherapy, but
   symptoms are not consistnet.
   - Prednisone 60mg PO, nebulizers, Azithromycin for COPD
   - f/u sputum cxs, NGTD
   - not treating PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] placed on prophylaxis now that he
ll be on
   steroids for long period of time
   - BNP only mildly elevated -> does not appear fluid overloaded on exam
   - f/u viral screen
   - Wean oxygen on venti mask, goal to get to NC today.

   #Leukocytosis: Concerning for infection, possible complication of
   therapy with Alimta with superimposed infection.  Leukemia unlikely
   given normal smear.  Went form 60 to 40 to 50 over last three days.
   - Pan-culture including C. Diff, no stool yet today.
   - Trend WBCs
   - c/s Heme/Onc consult re: possible role of Alimta in causing severe
   leukocytosis, likely from a combination of reaction in setting of
   cancer with the addition of steroids contributing

The patient has been treated with prednisone, nebulizers, and azithromycin for COPD exacerbation. The patient's leukocyte count has been fluctuating and is currently at 40.3 K/uL. There are concerns about infection, possible complications of therapy with Alimta, and the role of Alimta in causing severe leukocytosis. The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, and he does not have any signs of fluid overload. The patient's respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, and his ABG shows a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 30, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 198.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to COPD exacerbation or underlying severe lung disease, including metastatic NSCLC. The use of nebulizers and bronchodilators may help improve his respiratory status.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an infection. The pan-culture including C. Diff should be monitored, and trends in WBCs should be followed. Antibiotics have been started empirically.
3. Possible Complications of Alimta"

   This is a 81 y/o M w/ emphysema, metastatic NSCLC, CAD, who p/w
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory: Pt with tight airways overnight and diffuse wheezing in
   the AM responsive to nebs.  Likely etiology is COPD flare with
   underlying severe lung disease [**12-26**] metastatic NSCLC.  Pt did not need
   BiPAP overnight but appeared to be working hard this AM.  Given
   bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan would consider PCP
   pneumonia in the setting of recent steroid use from chemotherapy.
   - Prednisone 60mg PO, nebulizers, Azithromycin for COPD
   - f/u sputum cxs
   - will c/s covering for possible PCP given elevated LDH and recent
   steroid use (only add if CT chest suggest PCP).
   - BNP only mildly elevated -> does not appear fluid overloaded on exam
   - f/u viral screen
   - Wean oxygen on venti mask.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Concerning for infection, possible complication of
   therapy with Alimta with superimposed infection.  Leukemia unlikely
   given normal smear.
   - Pan-culture including C. Diff.
   - Trend WBCs
   - c/s Heme/Onc consult re: possible role of Alimta in causing severe
   leukocytosis
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - hold beta-blockers given COPD flare
   - avoid hydralazine if possible given h/o TAA
   - start captopril
   .
   #CAD: Continue statin, give low dose aspirin 81mg daily.  Hold
   beta-blocker for now [**12-26**] COPD flare.
   .
   #Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Pt without abdominal pain or hypotension.
   Stable.

The patient is well-nourished, with no muscle wasting, and has symmetric chest expansion. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive, oriented to time, place, and person, and able to follow simple commands. However, movement, tone, and skin assessment could not be performed due to the patient's condition.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (40.3 K/uL), slightly elevated hemoglobin (9.8 g/dL), low platelet count (254 K/uL), normal kidney function (creatinine 0.9 mg/dL), and slightly elevated lactate level (2.0 mmol/L). Other lab values, including electrolytes"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 y/o M w/ emphysema, metastatic NSCLC, CAD, who p/w
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory: Pt with tight airways overnight and diffuse wheezing in
   the AM responsive to nebs.  Likely etiology is COPD flare with
   underlying severe lung disease [**12-26**] metastatic NSCLC.  Pt did not need
   BiPAP overnight but appeared to be working hard this AM.  Given
   bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan would consider PCP
   pneumonia in the setting of recent steroid use from chemotherapy.
   - Prednisone 60mg PO, nebulizers, Azithromycin for COPD
   - f/u sputum cxs
   - will c/s covering for possible PCP given elevated LDH and recent
   steroid use (only add if CT chest suggest PCP).
   - BNP only mildly elevated -> does not appear fluid overloaded on exam
   - f/u viral screen
   - Wean oxygen on venti mask.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Concerning for infection, possible complication of
   therapy with Alimta with superimposed infection.  Leukemia unlikely
   given normal smear.
   - Pan-culture including C. Diff.
   - Trend WBCs
   - c/s Heme/Onc consult re: possible role of Alimta in causing severe
   leukocytosis
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - hold beta-blockers given COPD flare
   - avoid hydralazine if possible given h/o TAA
   - start captopril
   .
   #CAD: Continue statin, give low dose aspirin 81mg daily.  Hold
   beta-blocker for now [**12-26**] COPD flare.
   .
   #Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Pt without abdominal pain or hypotension.
   Stable.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of shortness of breath (SOB). They have been receiving nebulizers every couple of hours and showing some improvement in dyspnea. The patient has no known drug allergies. They have been administered antibiotics (Bactrim and Azithromycin), as well as other medications including Omeprazole, Heparin Sodium, prednisone, and nebs q6. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged except for the mentioned above.

24-hour events include:
- History obtained from the patient
- Allergies: No known drug allergies
- Last dose of antibiotics: Bactrim at 08:00 AM on 01/14/2164, Azithromycin at 12:20 PM on 01/14/2164
- Infusions: Omeprazole (Prilosec) at 08:48 PM on 01/14/2164, Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) at 08:45 AM on 01/15/2164
- Other medications: nebs q6, prednisone 60
- Changes to medical and family history: PMH, SH, FH and ROS are unchanged from Admission except where noted above and below

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data as of 01/15/2164 09:46 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

Physical examination reveals general appearance as not thin, normocephalic head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular system with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, peripheral vascular system with absent right radial and distal pulses, respiratory system showing wheezes, and neurologic system with attentive orientation and movement assessment not performed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels, along with other abnormalities in electrolytes, glucose, and arterial blood gas.

Assessment and plan include respiratory distress due to likely COPD flare triggered by viral respiratory tract infection, continuation of prednisone, nebs, and azithromycin. The patient also has cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung-related issues currently stable, leukocytosis, hypertension, and goals of care need addressing. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention, and comments regarding communication.

The patient is critically ill with a code status of full code and disposition to the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and requires face mask at 50%. He has a history of hypertension, ineffective coping, alteration in nutrition, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, and benign prostate hyperplasia. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, omeprazole, and heparin sodium. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate between 83-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90-152 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool device. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds with bilateral wheezes and rare crackles. The patient has absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's condition remains unchanged from the previous day.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient already has acute respiratory failure, which may worsen if adequate respiratory support is not maintained.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 y/o M w/ emphysema, metastatic NSCLC, CAD, who p/w
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory: Pt with tight on presentation which progressed to diffuse
   wheezing responsive to nebs.  Likely etiology is COPD flare with
   underlying severe lung disease [**12-26**] metastatic NSCLC.  Pt did not need
   BiPAP overnight but appeared to be working hard to breathe.  Feels
   subjectively better and accessory muscle use has decreased.  Given
   bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan would consider PCP
   pneumonia in the setting of recent steroid use from chemotherapy, but
   symptoms are not consistent.
   - Prednisone 60mg PO, nebulizers, Azithromycin for COPD
   - f/u sputum cxs, NGTD
   - not treating PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] placed on prophylaxis now that he
ll be on
   steroids for longer period of time
   - BNP only mildly elevated -> does not appear fluid overloaded on exam
   - f/u viral screen
   - Wean oxygen on venti mask, goal to get to NC today.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Concerning for infection, possible complication of
   therapy with Alimta with superimposed infection.  Leukemia unlikely
   given normal smear.  60 -> 40 -> 50 -> 50 over last four days.
   - Pan-culture including C. Diff
   - Trend WBCs
   - c/s Heme/Onc consult re: possible role of Alimta in causing severe
   leukocytosis, likely from a combination of reaction in setting of
   cancer with the addition of steroids contributing
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - hold beta-blockers given COPD flare
   - avoid hydralazine if possible given h/o TAA
   - started captopril
   .
   #CAD: Continue statin, give low dose aspirin 81mg daily.  Hold
   beta-blocker for now [**12-26**] COPD flare.
   .
   #Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Pt without abdominal pain or hypotension.
   Stable.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of emphysema, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with respiratory distress, which has been fluctuating in severity. The patient is currently receiving face mask oxygen at 50% and is on various medications including antibiotics, steroids, and other ICU medications.

Vital signs show a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/76 to 152/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36°C (96.8°F). The physical examination reveals diminished bilateral wheezes and no other significant findings.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 40.3 thousand/mm³, elevated hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal limits. Imaging studies show bilateral ground glass opacities on the CT scan.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a COPD flare-up with underlying severe lung disease, possibly exacerbated by metastatic NSCLC. He is being treated with nebulizers, prednisone, and azithromycin. Sputum cultures and nonin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of emphysema, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with respiratory distress, which has been fluctuating. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications including antibiotics, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Flare: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a COPD flare, which is a common complication in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Treatment includes bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
2. Metastatic NSCLC: The patient has metastatic NSCLC, which can cause lung-related complications such as pneumonia or worsening of respiratory function.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis suggests the possibility of an infection, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy. A pan-culture and viral screen should be done to identify the causative agent.
4. Alimta-induced Leukocytosis: Alimta, a chemotherapy drug, can cause severe leukocytosis as a side effect. The patient's increasing white blood cell count may be related to this medication.
5. Eosinophilia: The patient's elevated eosinophil count may indicate an allergic reaction or parasitic infection.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of emphysema, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with respiratory distress, which was initially thought to be a COPD flare-up but could also be related to worsening lung cancer or a reaction to recent chemotherapy. The patient has shown improvement with nebulizers and oxygen therapy.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which initially raised concerns for infection. However, it is now believed to be a result of the combination of cancer reaction and steroid treatment. He is not being treated for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) at this time.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing urinary retention with a post-void residual (PVR) of 900cc. He has overflow incontinence and has refused both a foley catheter and straight catheter. He has been started on Flo max and will have PVR checked every 6 hours. Follow-up urine cultures will also be conducted.

The patient's hypertension is being managed by avoiding beta-blockers due to COPD flare-up, and he has been started on captopril. His CAD treatment includes continuing statin therapy and low-dose aspirin. The thoracic aortic aneurysm is stable without abdominal pain or hypotension.

The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total input of 1,230 mL and output of 1,618 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -388 mL. His respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.27.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to a COPD flare-up, worsening lung cancer, or a reaction to chemotherapy. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Urinary Retention: The patient's urinary retention requires prompt management to prevent further complications such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage. Regular assessment of PVR and monitoring for signs of infection are crucial.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or a response to cancer treatment. Close observation for any signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy if needed is essential.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be carefully managed to avoid complications such as stroke or heart attack. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and adjustment of medication as necessary are important.
5. Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Although the patient's thoracic aortic aneurysm is currently stable, regular monitoring for any changes in symptoms or vital signs related to the aneurysm is necessary to prevent potential rupture."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 y/o M w/ emphysema, metastatic NSCLC, CAD, who p/w
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #Respiratory: Pt  tight on presentation which progressed to diffuse
   wheezing responsive to nebs.  Likely etiology is COPD flare with
   underlying severe lung disease [**12-26**] metastatic NSCLC, or worsening lung
   cancer/reaction to recent chemotherapy.  Pt did not need BiPAP
   overnight but appeared to be working hard to breathe.  Feels
   subjectively better and accessory muscle use has decreased.  Given
   bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan would consider PCP
   pneumonia in the setting of recent steroid use from chemotherapy, but
   symptoms are not consistent.
   - Prednisone 60mg PO, nebulizers, Azithromycin for COPD
   - f/u sputum cxs, NGTD
   - not treating PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] placed on prophylaxis now that he
ll be on
   steroids for longer period of time
   - BNP only mildly elevated -> does not appear fluid overloaded on exam
   - f/u viral screen
   - Wean oxygen on venti mask, goal to get to NC today.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Concerning for infection, possible complication of
   therapy with Alimta with superimposed infection.  Leukemia unlikely
   given normal smear.  60 -> 40 -> 50 -> 50 over last four days.
   - Pan-culture including C. Diff
   - Trend WBCs
   - c/s Heme/Onc consult re: possible role of Alimta in causing severe
   leukocytosis, likely from a combination of reaction in setting of
   cancer with the addition of steroids contributing.  Also ?re:
   eosinophilia.
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - hold beta-blockers given COPD flare
   - avoid hydralazine if possible given h/o TAA
   - started captopril
   .
   #CAD: Continue statin, give low dose aspirin 81mg daily.  Hold
   beta-blocker for now [**12-26**] COPD flare.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of emphysema, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with respiratory distress, which has progressed from tightness to diffuse wheezing responsive to nebulizers. The likely etiology is a COPD flare, underlying severe lung disease, or worsening lung cancer/reaction to recent chemotherapy. The patient's symptoms have improved, and accessory muscle use has decreased.

Assessment and Plan:
1. #Respiratory: The patient is being treated with prednisone, nebulizers, and azithromycin for COPD. Follow-up sputum cultures and NG tube drainage will be done. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) has been initiated due to recent steroid use from chemotherapy.
2. #Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count may be a complication of therapy with Alimta, possibly with a superimposed infection. Leukemia is unlikely given the normal smear. Pan-culture, including C. Diff, and trend WBCs will be done. Hematology/Oncology consultation is sought regarding the role of Alimta in causing severe leukocytosis.
3. #Hypertension: Beta-blockers are withheld due to COPD flare. Avoidance of hydralazine is recommended due to the patient's history of thor"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute. The patient has a history of hypertension, ineffective coping, alteration in nutrition, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, and benign alteration in nutrition. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with a range of 77-109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/54 mmHg to 159/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 20-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of acute respiratory failure indicates a compromised ability to breathe adequately. This can be attributed to the underlying lung cancer and may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The leukocytosis and eosinophilia mentioned in the progress note suggest a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment would be necessary.
3. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylaxis for DVT should be continued.
4. Stress Ulcer"
