","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was admitted to the hospital with pancytopenia, fatigue, and light-headedness and was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient started chemotherapy on May 28th and has been experiencing fevers, fluid overload, acute renal failure (ARF), and progressive pulmonary infiltrates. She also has altered mental status, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

The patient's respiratory condition worsened, leading to respiratory failure and intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2 of 508, and HCO3- of 18 mEq/L. Chest X-ray and CT scan reveal diffuse bilateral fluffy infiltrates, and there is suspicion of an infectious etiology. Blood cultures are pending, and extensive infectious workup has been unrevealing.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with evidence of mixed pre-renal and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She has a urine output of 748 mL, elevated serum creatinine of 3.4 mg/dL, and BUN of 51 mg/dL. There is concern for hypernatremia, and fluid management is ongoing.

The patient's thrombocytopenia and neutropenia require careful management. She has received broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids but may require adjustment of her chemotherapy regimen.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS: Continue aggressive supportive care, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates: Continue ventilatory support, optimize oxygenation, and consider decreasing FiO2 and following ABG.
3. ARF: Evaluate for mixed pre-renal and ATN, monitor renal function, and adjust medications accordingly.
4. Hypernatremia: Check osmolality, replace free water deficit, and hold diuretics.
5. AML/Chemotherapy: Follow oncology recommendations and monitor for any complications.
6. Neutropenia/Fever: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics.
7. Anemia: Monitor and manage as necessary.
8. Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count and bleeding risks.
9. Altered Mental Status: Monitor closely, especially for any signs of CNS involvement.
10. ICU Care: Provide nutrition support, maintain glycemic control, and monitor lines and prophylactic measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
4. Stress ulcer bleeding
5. Renal dysfunction
6. Drug reaction or toxicity
7. Infection-related complications (sepsis, septic shock)
8. Further deterioration in mental status
9. Fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome.
- Transferred to the hospital with pancytopenia, fatigue, and light-headedness.
- Diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started on chemotherapy on May 28th.
- Course characterized by fevers, fluid overload, acute renal failure (ARF), and progressive pulmonary infiltrates.
- Infectious workup unrevealing, including negative tests for PJP, beta glucan, and galactomannan.
- Currently in the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- On aggressive supportive care, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- Concern for noninfectious etiology, possibly drug reaction, given extensive infectious workup being unrevealing.
- Worsening renal dysfunction and elevated sodium levels.
- Plan includes continuing broad antibiotics, discussing with oncology team, and considering utility of steroids in ARDS.
- Other concerns include anemia, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe ARDS. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Infection: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and an extensive infectious workup, the"

   Fluid Overload
hold on diuresis, given
   Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear.  With two neg bronchs PJP
   seems unlikely and lack of blood makes alveolar hemorrhage equally
   unlikely. Although she is total body volume overloaded her exam does
   not suggest CHF with prominent mid-insp crackles.  She is tiring after
   initially responding to mask ventilation and is increasingly
   uncomfortable so we will intubate. She will need substantial sedation
   and likely a high minute ventilation as she is currently generating
   14-17 lpm. Her hemodynamic response to intubation may help us assess
   her intravascular volume status.  We are trying to diurese and will
   continue if her BP allows.  She is continuing on broad abx but it seems
   increasingly likely her pulmonary process is non-infectious.  She did
   get a dose of Solu-Medrol and will discuss with BMT whether that should
   be continued.  Plan is to try to correct free water deficit - will need
   to factor in ongoing losses if we continue diuresis.  Dosing all meds
   for her rising creatinine.  Will need to monitor glucose on steroids.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a complicated course of recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has been experiencing respiratory failure, hypoxemia, increased oxygen requirements, and progressive ground glass opacities on chest CT.

The patient's 24-hour events include fatigue with increased work of breathing, leading to intubation overnight. She was also hypertensive and tachycardic before intubation. She was started on multi-lumen and non-invasive ventilation, with blood cultures taken at 01:42 AM. An EKG was performed at 01:43 AM, and non-invasive ventilation was stopped at 02:30 AM. Invasive ventilation was started at 02:35 AM, and an arterial line was started at 03:03 AM.

The patient's allergies include Oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Voriconazole and Meropenem). Her medications include Midazolam (Versed), Fentanyl, Lasix, and others as per oncology recommendations.

The patient's physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, diffuse b/l fluffy infiltrates on chest imaging, and a small left effusion or atelectasis. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Imaging studies reveal diffuse b/l alveolar opacities, consolidation upper and"

   Fluid Overload
   Etiology of respiratory failure is unclear.  With two neg bronchs PJP
   seems unlikely and lack of blood makes alveolar hemorrhage equally
   unlikely. Although she is total body volume overloaded her exam does
   not suggest CHF with prominent mid-insp crackles.  She is tiring after
   initially responding to mask ventilation and is increasingly
   uncomfortable so we will intubate. She will need substantial sedation
   and likely a high minute ventilation as she is currently generating
   14-17 lpm. Her hemodynamic response to intubation may help us assess
   her intravascular volume status.  We are trying to diurese and will
   continue if her BP allows.  She is continuing on broad abx but it seems
   increasingly likely her pulmonary process is non-infectious.  She did
   get a dose of Solu-Medrol and will discuss with BMT whether that should
   be continued.  Plan is to try to correct free water deficit - will need
   to factor in ongoing losses if we continue diuresis.  Dosing all meds
   for her rising creatinine.  Will need to monitor glucose on steroids.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a complicated course of recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has been experiencing respiratory failure and hypoxemia, with increased oxygen requirements. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, showing improvement in right lower lobe (RUL) process but progressive ground glass opacities on chest CT.

24-hour events include fatigue with increased work of breathing, leading to intubation overnight. The patient also had episodes of hypertension and tachycardia pre-intubation. She was started on multi-lumen and non-invasive ventilation at different times, with invasive ventilation initiated at 02:35 AM. An arterial line was started at 03:03 AM.

The patient's allergies include Oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and she has been receiving antibiotics (Voriconazole and Meropenem) as per the ICU plan. Other medications include midazolam, fentanyl, and Lasix.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/78 mmHg to 94/65 mmHg, respiratory rate between 31-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350"

   continue to diurese in the face of renal failure with 40-80mg IV last,
   per renal, if hypertension, not responsive to intubation, pulmonary
   edema less likely
   - attempts and non-invasive had been met with improvement but pt still
   very tachypneic with minute ventilations between 13 and 17, have

   # Mental Status changes - over the course of today the patient has
   become non-verbal. She now has increased confusion but continues to
   follow commands with prompting.  Likely large componenet of fatigue
   from respiratory effort and no sleep.   CT Head negative for evidence
   of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic disease or emboli. However,
   given initial path significant for M4 AML which is known for CNS
   spread.  Bone marrow biopsy on [**1-19**] showed evidence of residual disease

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who has been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been experiencing shortness of breath and hypoxia, and her condition has been worsening despite non-rebreather therapy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her neurological status has also deteriorated, with the patient becoming non-verbal and experiencing increased confusion.

The patient has a history of polio and osteoporosis. She was admitted to the hospital with cough and fevers for 12 days, and a chest X-ray showed left upper lobe opacity. She was found to be pancytopenic and underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis, which revealed worsening hypoxia and mental status changes.

Her lab results indicate anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Her blood cultures and mycologic blood cultures are negative to date. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and a low urine output.

   negative for bleed this pm.
   .
   # AML: s/p completion of 7+3. Day 24. Neutropenic.
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor ANCs - neutropenic - ANC rising.   Avoiding G-CSF.
   - Family meeting today with onc team
   - repeat BMB
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - infection v. pneumonitis (aspiration v allergic
   v. meds) v. pulmonary edema v broncheoalveolar hemorrhage.  Has been on
   non-rebreather for > 24 hours s/p bronchoscopy, concern for intubation
   given h/o polio.
   - cont steroids for possible pneumonitis picture per pulm consult,
   probably [**1-28**] day coourse, some improvement seen on CXR today,

   # Anemia
 HCT 28.9>20.6, no obvious soucr of bleeind, likely dilution
   as pt had been aggressively diuresed and had not been taking po
s for
   several days prior to intubation.
   - transfuse 2 u pRBCs, HCT goal >25
   - f/u post-transfusion HCT
   - guaiac stools
   - hemolysis labs
   # Pneumonia/Febrile Neutropenia: Persistent low grade fevers, cultured.
   CT chest [**1-8**] showed decreased LUL opacity but more diffuse
   tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 667**] opacities concerning for atypical PNA, pulmonary
   hemorrhage, pulmonary edema. CT Chest [**12/2087**]- showed diffuse ground glass
   opacities. Pt continued to spike daily, refused repeat bronchoscopy.
   Was started on atovaquone and prednisone for empiric coverage of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]'d on [**1-26**] with negative glucan. Repeat CT [**1-27**] with rapid worsening,
   pt agreed to bronch. On am of bronchoscopy pt had a 4L O2 Requirement,
   was requiring 8L NC post bronch.  Now intubated
   - continue vancomycin. Dosing by level - will repeat trough tomorrow

   # Alkalemia
 likely [**12-27**] to bicarb administration
   - recheck ABG
   - decrease respiratory rate
   - no more bicarb
   .
   # ARF - FeNa 4%, likely ATN caused by underlying infection. Cr rising,
   UOP down, not responsive to fluid bolus.  Will likely get worse before
   it gets better.   Renal not recommending dialysis at this time
   - continue to monitor Cr and renally dose meds
   - appreciate renal input
   - pm lytes
   - no more free water or bicarb at this time
   .
   # Mental Status changes - over the course of today the patient has
   become non-verbal. She now has increased confusion but continues to
   follow commands with prompting.  Likely large componenet of fatigue
   from respiratory effort and no sleep.   CT Head negative for evidence
   of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic disease or emboli. However,
   given initial path significant for M4 AML which is known for CNS
   spread.  Bone marrow biopsy on [**1-19**] showed evidence of residual disease
   in addition to her LDH which has been steadily rising since her nadir
   on [**1-10**]. Consider toxic/metabolic effect as well. Continue to renally
   dose meds, treat hypoxia .  Will not be able to evaluate unil patient
   extubated.  At that time, if not improved, can consider  MRI +/- tap.
   .
   Hypernatremia - recent, central DI v. reset osmostat v extreme
   diuresis, urine osms 324
   - resolved with free water infusion
   .
   Tachycardia -  baseline 120s for last several days, [**1-27**] TTE not
   concerning for cardiotoxicity or damage in setting of sepsis, no gross
   abnormalities.  Could be a common side effect of chemptherapy
   treatment.
   - no intervention at this time
   - if concern for intravascular depletion can bolus
   - can transfuse for HCT<25

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and polio, who was admitted to the ICU with cough and fevers. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after presenting with pancytopenia. The patient has undergone chemotherapy treatment for AML, specifically the 7+3 regimen. She is now experiencing worsening hypoxia and mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to infection vs. pneumonitis (aspiration vs. allergic vs. medications) vs. pulmonary edema vs. bronchoalveolar hemorrhage. She has been on non-rebreather for > 24 hours following bronchoscopy, and there is concern for intubation given her history of polio.
2. Anemia - The patient's HCT level is low at 28.9%, indicating anemia. This may be due to dilution as the patient had been aggressively diuresed and had not been taking oral fluids prior to intubation.
3. Pneumonia/Febrile Neutropenia - The patient has persistent low-grade fevers and diffuse tree-in-bud opacities on CT chest, which are concerning for atypical pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pulmonary edema.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF) - The patient's creatinine level is rising, and she has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started treatment on May 28th. Her course has been complicated by fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and extensive infection workup revealing no specific pathogens. She was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, ARDS, and ventilator management. There is concern for a non-infectious etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates, possibly drug reaction, but no evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient's recent lab results show anemia, hypernatremia, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a need to optimize ventilator settings while monitoring for any signs of improvement or deterioration.
2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates: The infiltrates may indicate ongoing inflammation or infection within the lungs. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS requires careful management, including maintaining adequate oxygenation and minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.
4. Ventilator management: Adjustments to the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started chemotherapy on May 28th. The patient's course has been complicated by fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple infections. She was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure.

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics but the extensive infectious workup has been unrevealing. There is a concern for a non-infectious etiology, possibly a drug reaction. The patient's condition has worsened with increasing concern for intravascular volume depletion, worsening renal dysfunction, and elevated sodium levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - Continue broad antibx and an (antibiotics and antifungal) coverage. Discuss with oncology team the utility of steroids in ARDS. The patient appears to be oxygenating well on 60% FiO2 and 10 cmH2O PEEP. Attempt to decrease FiO2 and follow up with arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements.
2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates - Continue broad coverage antibiotics and steroids if there is suspicion of drug reaction. Follow-up chest X-ray (CX) data though unlikely infectious given extensive negative workup to date. Continue empirical steroids for another 2"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of lung bronchoalveolar carcinoma, polio, and osteoporosis. She was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by an infection, likely pneumonia. The patient also has acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post completion of 7+3 chemotherapy and is neutropenic. She has mental status changes, anemia, renal failure with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hypernatremia, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of breast cancer and is currently being treated for AML. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and mental status changes indicate the possibility of respiratory failure due to infection or other causes such as pneumonitis, aspiration, pulmonary edema, or bronchoalveolar hemorrhage.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's persistent low-grade fevers and recent neutropenia suggest the possibility of febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency in patients with AML.
3. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's rising creatinine levels and low urine output suggest the possibility of ATN, which can be caused by sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs, or hypotension.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with L BR CA diagnosed in [**7-/2161**], h/o polio and osteoporosis,
   transferred from OSH ER after presenting with cough and fevers x [**12-28**]
   days with reported LUL opacity, then found to be pancytopenic, now with
   new diagnosis of AML s/p completion of 7+3. S/P Bronchoscopy and BAL on
   [**1-27**], now with worsening hypoxia and mental status changes. CT Head
   negative for bleed this pm.
   .
   # AML: s/p completion of 7+3. Day 24. Neutropenic.
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor ANCs - neutropenic - ANC rising.   Avoiding G-CSF.
   - repeat BMB  Monday
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - infection v. pneumonitis (aspiration v allergic
   v. meds) v. pulmonary edema v broncheoalveolar hemorrhage.  Has been on
   non-rebreather for > 24 hours s/p bronchoscopy, concern for intubation
   given h/o polio.
   - cont steroids, solumedrol 40mg q12H, for possible pneumonitis picture
   per pulm consult, probably [**1-28**] day coourse, some improvement seen on
   CXR today, now day 3
   - cont vanc, dosed by level, [**Last Name (un) 430**], levo, and fluc
   -  follow up on all cx data, CMV viral load
   -  f/u ID rec
   .
   # Anemia
 HCT 28.9>20.6, no obvious source of bleeing, likely dilution
   as pt had been aggressively diuresed and had not been taking po
s for
   several days prior to intubation.
   - transfused 2 u pRBCs, bumped appropriately
   -  HCT goal >25
   -transfusion HCT
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   .
    # Pneumonia/Febrile Neutropenia: Persistent low grade fevers,
   cultured. CT chest [**1-8**] showed decreased LUL opacity but more diffuse
   tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 667**] opacities concerning for atypical PNA, pulmonary
   hemorrhage, pulmonary edema. CT Chest [**12/2087**]- showed diffuse ground glass
   opacities. Pt continued to spike daily, refused repeat bronchoscopy.
   Was started on atovaquone and prednisone for empiric coverage of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]'d on [**1-26**] with negative glucan. Repeat CT [**1-27**] with rapid worsening,
   pt agreed to bronch. On am of bronchoscopy pt had a 4L O2 Requirement,
   was requiring 8L NC post bronch.  Now intubated
   - continue vancomycin. Dosing by level - will repeat trough tomorrow
   AM
   - continue meropenem, voriconazole, and levaquin
   - solumedrol 40mg q12H
   - f/u mycolytic blood cultures, blood cultures, all micro and lab data
   - neg to date
   - f/u BAL culture data - negative to date
   - appreciate ID input
   .
   # ARF - FeNa 4%, likely ATN caused by underlying infection. Cr rising,
   UOP down, not responsive to fluid bolus.  Will likely get worse before
   it gets better.   Dark brown casts in urine.
   - dark brown casts in urine
   - continue to monitor Cr and renally dose meds
   - appreciate renal input
   - pm lytes
   - switch tube feeds to [**Month/Day (4) **] renal for less K
   .
   # Mental Status changes - over the course of today the patient has
   become non-verbal. She now has increased confusion but continues to
   follow commands with prompting.  Likely large componenet of fatigue
   from respiratory effort and no sleep.   CT Head negative for evidence
   of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic disease or emboli. However,
   given initial path significant for M4 AML which is known for CNS
   spread.  Bone marrow biopsy on [**1-19**] showed evidence of residual disease
   in addition to her LDH which has been steadily rising since her nadir
   on [**1-10**]. Consider toxic/metabolic effect as well. Continue to renally
   dose meds, treat hypoxia .  Will not be able to evaluate unil patient
   extubated.  At that time, if not improved, can consider  MRI +/- tap.
   .
   Tachycardia -  baseline 120s for last several days, [**1-27**] TTE not
   concerning for cardiotoxicity or damage in setting of sepsis, no gross
   abnormalities.  Could be a common side effect of chemptherapy
   treatment.
   - no intervention at this time
   - if concern for intravascular depletion can bolus
   - can transfuse for HCT<25

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), currently on day 24 of chemotherapy treatment. She presented with cough and fevers for 12 days, reported left upper lobe opacity on chest X-ray, and was found to be pancytopenic. The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxia and mental status changes. CT Head showed no evidence of bleed or metastatic disease. She has been aggressively diuresed, had not been taking oral medications for several days prior to intubation, and has a HCT of 28.9%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - infection vs. pneumonitis (aspiration vs. allergic vs. medications) vs. pulmonary edema vs. bronchoalveolar hemorrhage.
2. Anemia - HCT 28.9>20.6, likely dilution as the patient had been aggressively diuresed and had not been taking oral medications for several days prior to intubation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - FeNa 4%, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by underlying infection. Creatinine (Cr) is rising, urine output (UOP) is down, not responsive to fluid bolus.
4. Mental Status Changes - the patient has become non-verbal and has increased confusion but continues to follow commands with prompting. This"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started chemotherapy on [5-28] [1-6]. The patient presented with fevers, left lower lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure due to ARDS. The extensive infectious workup has been unrevealing, and the patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern for a noninfectious etiology, possibly a drug reaction, but no evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient's volume status is oliguric, and there are muddy brown casts present on spun urine, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 28.9 to 20.6, and she has received 2 units of packed red blood cells. Her creatinine level has risen from 2.4 to 4.4. The patient's oxygenation has improved, and the ventilator settings will be adjusted accordingly. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, including hypernatremia and hyperkalemia. She is also experiencing anemia, likely due to post-chemotherapy response and dilutional"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of left breast cancer, polio, and osteoporosis. She was diagnosed with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3. Post-induction, she developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated and transferred to the ICU. The infectious workup has been unrevealing to date.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, leading to respiratory failure. There is a concern for a non-infectious etiology, such as drug reaction. She is currently on broad antibiosis and being monitored closely.
2. AML: The patient completed her 7+3 chemotherapy regimen for AML and is now in the post-induction phase. She remains neutropenic with a granulocyte count of 120 and is showing signs of marrow reconstitution. Repeat bone marrow biopsy is planned.
3. Anemia: The patient has been transfusion-dependent since induction chemotherapy. Her hemoglobin concentration has been stable at around 10.0 g/dL post-transfusion. Transfusion support will continue to maintain her hemoglobin level above 25%.

   - switched tube feeds to nutren renal for less K
   .
   # Mental Status changes - over the course of today the patient has
   become non-verbal. She now has increased confusion but continues to
   follow commands with prompting.  Likely large componenet of fatigue
   from respiratory effort and no sleep.   CT Head negative for evidence
   of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic disease or emboli. However,
   given initial path significant for M4 AML which is known for CNS
   spread.  Bone marrow biopsy on [**1-19**] showed evidence of residual disease
   in addition to her LDH which has been steadily rising since her nadir
   on [**1-10**]. Consider toxic/metabolic effect as well. Continue to renally
   dose meds, treat hypoxia .  Will not be able to evaluate unil patient

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of left breast cancer, diagnosed with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after receiving induction chemotherapy with 7+3. Post-induction course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to infection versus pneumonitis, aspiration, pulmonary edema, or bronchoalveolar hemorrhage. She has been on a non-rebreather mask for over 24 hours following a bronchoscopy, and there is concern for intubation given her history of polio. 

Other issues include anemia, pneumonia/febrile neutropenia, acute kidney injury (ATN), and mental status changes. The patient has been transfusion-dependent since induction chemotherapy and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**1-30**] to maintain a hemoglobin level above 25. The cause of bleeding is unclear, and hemolysis labs are negative.

The patient's recent CT chest showed improvement in left upper lobe opacity but more diffuse tree-in-bud opacities concerning for atypical pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pulmonary edema. She was started on atovaquone and prednisone for empirical coverage of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), but a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction therapy with 7+3. She developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was transferred to the ICU, intubated, and underwent a bronchoscopy on 01/27/2167. 

The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia, which initially improved with antibiotics. However, after induction with 7+3, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS. She was intubated on 01/27/2167. An extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The clinical picture is complicated by volume overload, but infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. 

The patient's condition is stable with oxygenation at 60% FiO2 and 10 cmH2O PEEP, with plans to decrease FiO2 and wean PEEP over the next 24-48 hours. Her chest X-ray shows overall improvement, and pressure support trials will be continued over the weekend. 

The patient's AML status post completion of 7+3 on day 24 is neutropenic with a granulocyte count of 120 and returning monocytes on the differential from 01"

   from respiratory effort and no sleep.   CT Head negative for evidence
   of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic disease or emboli. However,
   given initial path significant for M4 AML which is known for CNS
   spread.  Bone marrow biopsy on [**1-19**] showed evidence of residual disease
   in addition to her LDH which has been steadily rising since her nadir
   on [**1-10**]. Consider toxic/metabolic effect as well. Continue to renally

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started chemotherapy on [5-28] [1-6]. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, ARDS, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, acute renal failure, mental status changes, and possible drug-induced tumor necrosis. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to ARDS, infection, or a noninfectious etiology such as drug reaction. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. ARDS: The patient has shown some improvement in imaging, suggesting a possible response to steroid therapy. Continued supportive care with weaning of ventilatory support as tolerated is recommended.
3. Pneumonia: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and bronchoscopy, the cause of the pneumonia remains unidentified. Continued monitoring and adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
4. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's persistent low-grade fevers indicate ongoing infection despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evaluation of microbiology data and potential changes in antibiotic therapy should be considered.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ATN): The patient's muddy brown casts in urine suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely caused by underlying infection, medications"

   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, initially
   improved on Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developped bilateral
   lower lobe infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive
   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad antibx at time of
   bronch.  Clinical picture complicated by component of volume overload,
   but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone. Plan to wean sedation
   today & continue with pressure support trial.  Working towards
   extubation in next 48hrs
   - Vanc continues to be supratherapeutic, holding for now
   - continue meropenem, levofloxacin and voriconazole
   - begin steroid taper, solumedrol to 30mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   -  f/u ID recs
   -  f/u pending culture data
   -  CXR overall improved
   -  attempt aggressive diuresis with Lasix 120mg IV + Chlorthiazide for
   goal of net -1L today.
   # AML:  Day 24 s/p induction with 7+3. Neutropenic, gran count 120,
   monos return on diff from [**1-30**] e/o marrow reconstitution
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , still neutropenic but ANC rising.   Avoiding
   G-CSF.
   - repeat BMBx Monday per hem/onc
   .
   # ARF
 pt with rising BUN/Creatinine & [**Month (only) 38**] UOP. Muddy brown casts in
   urinary sediment consistent with ATN, etiology unclear.   Creatinine
   plateau not defined yet, waiting on resolution.  UOP did not respond
   approp to Lasix 80mg challenge. Potassium currently 5.1, but no EKG
   changes noted.
   - continue to monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **] & renally dose meds.
   - admin Lasix 120mg IV today + chlorthiazide 500mg, monitoring i/os
   - starting lanthanum for elevated phos
   - f/u renal recs
   - switched tube feeds to nutren renal for less K
   # Anemia

   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head negative for evidence of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic
   disease or emboli. However, given initial path significant for M4 AML
   which is known for CNS spread. Consider toxic/metabolic/hypoxia &
   polypharmacy as most likely etiology of MS changes.
   -continue to renally dose meds, treat hypoxia .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3 chemotherapy. The patient's post-induction course has been complicated by febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on [**2167-1-27**] and underwent a bronchoscopy on the same day.

The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia, which initially improved with antibiotics. However, she then developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, leading to her intubation. Extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's clinical picture is complicated by volume overload, but the infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. The plan is to wean sedation today and continue with a pressure support trial. The goal is to extubate the patient within the next 48 hours.

Regarding the potential medical complications, the patient has the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, requiring intubation. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but her extensive infectious workup has been negative to date. She is currently showing improvement in her respiratory status.

2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (AT"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome.
- She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started treatment on [**5-28**] [**1-6**].
- The patient's course has been complicated by fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing.
- She was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation support.
- Recent lab results show anemia, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, and altered mental status.
- Imaging studies suggest improvement, which might indicate a response to steroids.
- The patient's current goals include weaning off sedation, decreasing FiO2 and peep, and preparing for extubation.
- There are concerns about noninfectious etiologies such as drug reaction or volume overload contributing to her ARDS.
- The patient's renal function has improved, but she still has an elevated BUN and creatinine level.
- She also has an elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count.
- The patient's electrolyte imbalances have resolved"

   improved on Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developped bilateral
   lower lobe infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive
   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad antibx at time of
   bronch.  Clinical picture complicated by component of volume overload,
   but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone. Tolerated PS trial
   yesterday.  Working towards extubation in next 48hrs
   - Vanc continues to be supratherapeutic, holding for now
   - continue meropenem, levofloxacin and voriconazole
   - continue steroid taper, solumedrol from 30mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20mg today
   -  f/u ID recs
   -  f/u pending culture data
   -  difficult to diurese, continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix
   increased to 120mg IV + Chlorthiazide has been unsuccessful.  Followed
   by renal, planned single HD session today after placement of temporary
   HD line.
   # AML:  Day 24 s/p induction with 7+3. Neutropenic, gran count 120,
   monos return on diff from [**1-30**] e/o marrow reconstitution
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , still neutropenic but ANC rising.   Avoiding
   G-CSF.
   - repeat BMBx today to evaluate for continued blasts per hem/onc
   .
   # ARF
 pt with rising BUN/Creatinine & [**Month (only) 38**] UOP. Muddy brown casts in
   urinary sediment consistent with ATN, etiology unclear.   Creatinine
   plateau not defined yet, waiting on resolution.  UOP did not respond
   approp to Lasix 120mg challenge. Potassium down to normal range from
   5.1, but no EKG changes noted.
   - continue to monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **] & renally dose meds.
   - HD today given unresolving supratherapeutic vanc level, planned one
   time session.  Temporary HD cath should be removed.
   - continue lanthanum for elevated phos
   - f/u renal recs
   - switched tube feeds to nutren renal for less K
   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Post transfusion hct has been stable at
   29, no obvious source of bleeding.  Marrow beginning to reconstitute
   - transfusion to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   .
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head negative for evidence of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic
   disease or emboli. However, given initial path significant for M4 AML
   which is known for CNS spread. Consider toxic/metabolic/hypoxia &
   polypharmacy as most likely etiology of MS changes.
   -continue to renally dose meds, treat hypoxia .
   -will be able to better evaluate when patient extubated, will consider
   MRI if MS [**First Name (Titles) 292**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1479**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3 but developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and underwent a bronchoscopy on January 27th.

The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia (PNA), which initially improved with antibiotics. However, after induction chemotherapy, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, leading to intubation on January 27th. An extensive infectious workup has been negative so far, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's clinical picture is complicated by volume overload, but the infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. She tolerated a pressure support (PS) trial yesterday and is working towards extubation in the next 48 hours.

The patient's AML status is being monitored, as she is on day 24 post-induction chemotherapy. She remains neutropenic with a granulocyte count of 120, but her monocytes are returning. The plan is to avoid granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and repeat a bone marrow biopsy today to evaluate for continued blasts per hem/onc.

The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI), with rising blood ure"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. She presented with respiratory failure and was intubated on [**2167-1-27**]. The initial presentation included upper lobe pneumonia, which initially improved with antibiotics. However, after induction with 7+3, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and she is currently on broad antibiosis.

The patient also has anemia that has been transfusion-dependent since induction. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) on [**1-30**] with a pre-transfusion hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 20%. Post-transfusion Hct has been stable at 29% without any obvious source of bleeding. The patient's bone marrow is beginning to reconstitute.

Additionally, the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, along with muddy brown casts in the urinary sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The etiology of AKI is unclear, and her urine output did not respond appropriately to a Lasix 120mg challenge. Her potassium levels have normalized, but no electrocardiogram (EKG) changes have"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started on chemotherapy. However, she developed fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Despite an extensive infection workup, no specific cause was found. The patient was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS, possibly steroid-responsive pneumonitis. She tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) well and may be extubated in the next 1-2 days. Steroid dosage will be tapered to solumedrol 20 IV q12h.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): likely a mixed pre-renal atn picture with improved gap metabolic acidosis after fluid resuscitation and bicarbonate administration. Creatinine levels are elevated, and plans include dialysis today for elevated vancomycin levels. Ultrasound-guided fluid removal (UF) will also be considered.
3. Anemia: stable, no signs of active bleeding.
4. Hyperkalemia: potassium levels have decreased from 5.1 yesterday.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, initially
   improved on Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developped bilateral
   lower lobe infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive
   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad antibx at time of
   bronch.  Clinical picture complicated by component of volume overload,
   but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone. Tolerated PS trial
   yesterday.  Working towards extubation in next 48hrs
   - Vanc continues to be supratherapeutic, holding for now
   - continue meropenem, levofloxacin and voriconazole
   - continue steroid taper, solumedrol from 30mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20mg today
   -  f/u ID recs
   -  f/u pending culture data
   -  difficult to diurese, continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix
   increased to 120mg IV + Chlorthiazide has been unsuccessful.  Followed
   by renal, planned single HD session today after placement of temporary
   HD line.
   # AML:  Day 24 s/p induction with 7+3. Neutropenic, gran count 120,
   monos return on diff from [**1-30**] e/o marrow reconstitution
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , still neutropenic but ANC rising.   Avoiding
   G-CSF.
   - repeat BMBx today to evaluate for continued blasts per hem/onc
   .
   # ARF
 pt with rising BUN/Creatinine & [**Month (only) 38**] UOP. Muddy brown casts in
   urinary sediment consistent with ATN, etiology unclear.   Creatinine
   plateau not defined yet, waiting on resolution.  UOP did not respond
   approp to Lasix 120mg challenge. Potassium down to normal range from
   5.1, but no EKG changes noted.
   - continue to monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **] & renally dose meds.
   - HD today given unresolving supratherapeutic vanc level, planned one
   time session.  Temporary HD cath should be removed.
   - continue lanthanum for elevated phos
   - f/u renal recs
   - switched tube feeds to nutren renal for less K
   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Post transfusion hct has been stable at
   29, no obvious source of bleeding.  Marrow beginning to reconstitute
   - transfusion to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   .
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head negative for evidence of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic
   disease or emboli. However, given initial path significant for M4 AML
   which is known for CNS spread. Consider toxic/metabolic/hypoxia &
   polypharmacy as most likely etiology of MS changes.
   -continue to renally dose meds, treat hypoxia .
   -will be able to better evaluate when patient extubated, will consider
   MRI if MS [**First Name (Titles) 292**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1479**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. The patient developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated and underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**]. The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia but subsequently developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, leading to intubation on [**2167-1-27**]. An extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and she is currently on broad antibiotherapy.

The patient's clinical picture is complicated by volume overload, but infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. She tolerated a pressure support trial yesterday and is working towards extubation within the next 48 hours. The plan includes continuing vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin, and voriconazole. Steroid tapering with solumedrol from 30mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20mg today will continue, along with following ID recommendations, pending culture data, and aggressive diuresis with Lasix.

   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad antibx at time of
   bronch.  Clinical picture complicated by component of volume overload,
   but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone. Tolerated PS trial
   yesterday.  Working towards extubation in next 48hrs
   - Vanc continues to be supratherapeutic, holding for now, HD yesterday
   to lower level
   - continue meropenem, levofloxacin and voriconazole

   # AML:  Day 24 s/p induction with 7+3. Neutropenic, gran count 120,
   monos return on diff from [**1-30**] e/o marrow reconstitution
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , still neutropenic but ANC rising.   Avoiding
   G-CSF.
   - repeat BMBx today to evaluate for continued blasts per hem/onc

   # ARF
 pt with rising BUN/Creatinine & [**Month (only) 38**] UOP. Muddy brown casts in
   urinary sediment consistent with ATN, etiology unclear.   Creatinine
   plateau not defined yet, waiting on resolution.  UOP did not respond
   approp to Lasix 120mg challenge. Potassium down to normal range from
   5.1, but no EKG changes noted.
   - continue to monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **] & renally dose meds.
   - HD today given unresolving supratherapeutic vanc level, planned one
   time session.  Temporary HD cath should be removed.
   - continue lanthanum for elevated phos
   - f/u renal recs
   - switched tube feeds to nutren renal for less K
   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Post transfusion hct has been stable at

   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head negative for evidence of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic
   disease or emboli. However, given initial path significant for M4 AML
   which is known for CNS spread. Consider toxic/metabolic/hypoxia &
   polypharmacy as most likely etiology of MS changes.
   -continue to renally dose meds, treat hypoxia .
   -will be able to better evaluate when patient extubated, will consider

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction therapy with 7+3. The post-induction course has been complicated by febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and underwent a bronchoscopy on January 27th.

The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia, which initially improved with antibiotics. However, after induction with 7+3, the patient developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS. The infectious workup has been negative so far, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The clinical picture is complicated by volume overload, but the infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. The patient tolerated a pressure support trial yesterday and is working towards extubation in the next 48 hours.

Other findings include:
- Supratherapeutic vancomycin levels, which are being managed with hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient continues to receive meropenem, levofloxacin, and voriconazole.
- Steroid tapering with solumedrol is ongoing.
- The patient's white blood cell count is low (neutropenic) but is rising.
- Repeat bone marrow biopsy is planned to evaluate for continued blasts.
- The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with muddy brown"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. She presented with febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on [**2167-1-27**] after developing bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS. An extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and she is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient has been complicated by component of volume overload, but infiltrates are not likely pulmonary edema alone. She tolerated a pressure support (PS) trial yesterday and is working towards extubation in the next 48 hours. Her ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

She has had a PICC line placed for central venous access, as well as a temporary hemodialysis (HD) catheter due to elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Her urine output has been low, and she has been diuresed with Lasix and albumin.

The patient also has anemia due to bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started treatment on [5-28]. The patient has had fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). All cultures have been negative, and possible steroid-responsive pneumonitis is suspected. The patient has shown improvement on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and may be considered for extubation in the next 1-2 days. Steroids are being tapered, and aggressive diuresis will be attempted if good mechanics and decreased FiO2 are observed.

The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF), likely a mixed pre-renal atn picture with improved gap metabolic acidosis after fluids and bicarbonate. Dialysis was performed for elevated vancomycin levels. Anemia is stable and likely due to chemotherapy and renal failure, with no signs of active bleeding. Hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia have resolved with hemodialysis (HD). The patient is neutropenic but has an improving absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may be considered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will continue to"

   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, initially
   improved on Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developped bilateral
   lower lobe infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive
   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad antibx at time of

   - repeat b-glucan
   - goal net negative 1L
   - Has done well on pressure support w/ PEEP now down to 5 and FIO2
   40%.   Will attempt to extubate today/tomorrow.  While patient rapid RR
   contributing to alkalosis, some secondary metabolic process also
   contributing to alkalemia.
   # AML:  Day 28 s/p induction with 7+3. Neutropenic, monos return on
   diff from [**1-30**] e/o marrow reconstitution
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3 and subsequently developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated on January 27th and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite extensive infectious workup, no specific pathogen has been identified. The patient's clinical picture is complicated by volume overload, as evidenced by elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, but the infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. The patient tolerated a pressure support trial yesterday and is working towards extubation within the next 48 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia but then developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, leading to respiratory failure. She remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient remains at risk for further infections, particularly since she is neutropenic.
3. Volume Overload: The patient exhibits signs of volume overload, as indicated by elevated BNP levels and fluid accumulation. This may contribute to worsening respiratory status.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, along"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started treatment on [**5-28**] [**1-6**]. The patient presented with fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and renal failure. She was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but all cultures have been negative. There is a possibility of steroid-responsive pneumonitis, as she was taken off steroids yesterday.

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS, unknown precipitant, all cultures negative, possible steroid-responsive pneumonitis. She did well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but is still hypoxemic. It is planned to extubate once oxygenation improves. She did not respond to diuretics, and there is a concern for volume overload, especially once off positive pressure.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): creatinine levels are increasing, and the patient is oliguric. It is likely a mixed pre-renal azotemia picture (muddy brown casts on urinalysis). The patient was dialyzed for elevated vancomycin levels. She would likely benefit from hemodialysis for"

   Diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality with areas of consolidative
   coalescence have been present for several weeks.  Compared to [**2-2**],
   the
   interstitial edema and moderate right pleural effusion present have
   increased
   though heart size remains normal.  ET tube and nasogastric tube in
   standard
   placements.  Left PIC catheter can be traced to a low SVC, but the tip
   is
   indistinct.  No pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, initially
   improved on Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developped bilateral
   lower lobe infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive
   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad spectrum abx.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   [**12-27**] to reactive pneumonitis, as had responded to steroids.  Clinical
   picture complicated by component of volume overload w/ BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**]
   normal EF, but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone.  SBI
   yesterday showed drop in PO2 to 60.  CXR shows worsening fluid overload
   in oliguric patient.  HD catheter placed yesterday, w/ planned for HD
   today in order to hopefully facilitaty extubation with concern that
   patient would have possibility of flashing w/ elimination of PEEP.
   - Vanc (day 1 [**1-15**]) continues to be supratherapeutic, holding for now,
   HD tow days agao to lower level, still remains elevated
   -  Patient no longer neutrapenic, and levofloxacin d/c yesterday.  Will
   continue meropenem (day 11) / voriconazole (since [**1-7**]), but will
   discuss w/ ID if they feel comfortable stripping off abx.
   - steroids started for reactive pneumonitis now tapered off
   - repeat b-glucan pending
   - Has done well on pressure support w/ PEEP now down to 5 and FIO2 50%
   (increased from 40% overnight.)   Will attempt to extubate
   today/tomorrow following dialysis.  While patient rapid RR contributing
   to alkalosis, some secondary metabolic process also contributing to
   alkalemia.
   # AML:  Day 28 s/p induction with 7+3. Neutropenic, monos return on
   diff from [**1-30**] e/o marrow reconstitution
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , no longer neutropenic  Avoiding G-CSF.
   - f/u BMT rec
   # ARF
 pt with rising BUN/Creatinine & [**Month (only) 38**] UOP. Muddy brown casts in
   urinary sediment consistent with ATN, etiology unclear.   Creatinine
   plateau not defined yet, waiting on resolution.  UOP did not respond
   approp to Lasix/thiazide/albumin. No Longer hyperkalemic.   Pt required
   HD x1 [**2-2**] for elevated vanc level is setting of renal failure and
   marrow suppression.  2.5L removed.  HD catheter removed after the one
   use.  Pt oliguric yesterday and concern that patient could have
   worsened volume overload comprimising respiration after extubation.  HD
   catheter yesterday placed, but was not dialyzed.  Planed for HD today,
   but patient now making urine.
   - plan  for HD today, but will consider new lasix trial to see if
   necessary
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders, increased yesterday
    # Afib
 new, started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter,
   likely due to atrial irritation.  Was temporary controlled on dilt gtt,
   now well controlled in sinus on po meds.  Will follow.
   - continue current regimen
   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Post transfusion hct has been stable at
   29, no obvious source of bleeding.  Marrow beginning to reconstitute.
   Received Eop with HD
   - transfusion to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head negative for evidence of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic
   disease or emboli. However, given initial path significant for M4 AML
   which is known for CNS spread. Consider toxic/metabolic/hypoxia &
   polypharmacy as most likely etiology of MS changes.
    -continue to renally dose meds, treat hypoxia .
   -will be able to better evaluate when patient extubated, will consider
   MRI if MS [**First Name (Titles) 292**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1479**]

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, ARDS, febrile neutropenia, and other complications.

Summary:
- The patient has been intubated since January 27th and has shown improvement in her condition.
- She has developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, despite initial improvement on antibiotics.
- Her infectious workup has been negative, and she has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient's clinical picture is complicated by volume overload, as indicated by a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 1527, normal ejection fraction, and worsening fluid overload on chest X-ray.

   Diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality with areas of consolidative

   the
   interstitial edema and moderate right pleural effusion present have
   increased
   though heart size remains normal.  ET tube and nasogastric tube in
   standard
   placements.  Left PIC catheter can be traced to a low SVC, but the tip
   is
   indistinct.  No pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, initially
   improved on Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developped bilateral
   lower lobe infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive
   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad spectrum abx.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   [**12-27**] to reactive pneumonitis, as had responded to steroids.  Clinical
   picture complicated by component of volume overload w/ BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**]
   normal EF, but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone.  SBI
   yesterday showed drop in PO2 to 60.  CXR shows worsening fluid overload
   in oliguric patient.  HD catheter placed yesterday, w/ planned for HD
   today in order to hopefully facilitaty extubation with concern that
   patient would have possibility of flashing w/ elimination of PEEP.
   - Vanc (day 1 [**1-15**]) continues to be supratherapeutic, holding for now,
   HD tow days agao to lower level, still remains elevated
   -  Patient no longer neutrapenic, and levofloxacin d/c yesterday.  Will
   continue meropenem (day 11) / voriconazole (since [**1-7**]), but will
   discuss w/ ID if they feel comfortable stripping off abx.
   - steroids started for reactive pneumonitis now tapered off
   - repeat b-glucan pending
   - Has done well on pressure support w/ PEEP now down to 5 and FIO2 50%
   (increased from 40% overnight.)   Will attempt to extubate
   today/tomorrow following dialysis.  While patient rapid RR contributing
   to alkalosis, some secondary metabolic process also contributing to
   alkalemia likely contraction.
   # AML:  Day 28 s/p induction with 7+3. No longer neutrapecic
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , no longer neutropenic  Avoiding G-CSF.
   - f/u BMT rec
   # ARF
 pt with rising BUN/Creatinine & [**Month (only) 38**] UOP. Muddy brown casts in
   urinary sediment consistent with ATN, etiology unclear.   Creatinine
   plateau not defined yet, waiting on resolution.  UOP did not respond
   approp to Lasix/thiazide/albumin. No Longer hyperkalemic.   Pt required
   HD x1 [**2-2**] for elevated vanc level is setting of renal failure and
   marrow suppression.  2.5L removed.  HD catheter removed after the one
   use.  Pt oliguric yesterday and concern that patient could have
   worsened volume overload comprimising respiration after extubation.  HD
   catheter yesterday placed, but was not dialyzed.  Planed for HD today,
   but patient now making urine.
   - plan  for HD today
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders, increased yesterday
    # Afib
 new, started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter,
   likely due to atrial irritation.  Was temporary controlled on dilt gtt,
   now well controlled in sinus on po meds.  Will follow.
   - continue current regimen
   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Post transfusion hct has been stable at
   29, no obvious source of bleeding.  Marrow beginning to reconstitute.
   Received Eop with HD
   - transfusion to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head negative for evidence of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic
   disease or emboli. However, given initial path significant for M4 AML
   which is known for CNS spread. Consider toxic/metabolic/hypoxia &
   polypharmacy as most likely etiology of MS changes.
    -continue to renally dose meds, treat hypoxia .
   -will be able to better evaluate when patient extubated, will consider
   MRI if MS [**First Name (Titles) 292**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1479**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. She has been in the ICU since January 27th due to respiratory failure, ARDS, and febrile neutropenia. The patient's clinical picture has been complicated by components of volume overload, worsening hypoxia, and ARDS. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics but extensive infectious workup has been negative. 

The patient's recent progress includes being no longer neutropenic and levofloxacin was discontinued yesterday. She continues on meropenem (day 11) / voriconazole (since January 7th), but the ID will discuss if they feel comfortable stripping off antibiotics. Steroids were started for reactive pneumonitis and are now being tapered off. Her blood glucose levels have been stable within normal range. 

The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status, now on pressure support with PEEP down to 5 and FiO2 at 50% (increased from 40% overnight). She is expected to undergo extubation today/tomorrow following dialysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia, initially improved on antibiotics. However, after induction with 7+3, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started chemotherapy on [5-28] [1-6]. The patient has been experiencing fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure, and ARDS. She was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient has respiratory failure with ARDS, unknown precipitant, all cultures negative, possible steroid-responsive pneumonitis. She is off steroids as of [2-3]. She has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with low pressures but remains oliguric and hypoxemic. She started producing urine yesterday and will likely benefit from dialysis. She may be extubated today following hemodialysis (HD).

2. The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF), with increasing blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, but improving urine output. She likely has a mixed pre-renal acute tubular necrosis (ATN) picture. She was previously dialyzed for an elevated vancomycin level and would benefit from HD for volume overload. Her phosphate levels are expected to normalize now that she is urinating.

3. The patient's anemia has improved, with a stable hematocrit (H"

   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, initially
   improved on Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developed bilateral
   lower lobe infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive
   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad spectrum abx.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   [**12-27**] to reactive pneumonitis, as had responded to steroids.  Clinical
   picture complicated by component of volume overload w/ BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**]
   normal EF, but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone.
   - Vanc (day 1 [**1-15**]) continues to be supratherapeutic, holding for now,
   despite HD, still remains elevated
   -  Patient no longer neutrapenic, and levofloxacin and vori had been
   d/c
d, however, BMT would like to keep all antibiotics on until not
   neutropenic for 7 days and off the vent.  Vori restarted and
   subsequently LVQ also restarted [**12-27**] persistent fevers.
   - steroids started for reactive pneumonitis now tapered off
   - Has done well on pressure support w/ PEEP now down to 8 and FIO2 50%
   (increased from 40% overnight.)   Will attempt to extubate
   today/tomorrow with aggressive vent weaning.
   - While patient rapid RR contributing to alkalosis, some secondary
   metabolic process also contributing to alkalemia likely contraction.

   HD x2 for elevated vanc level is setting of renal failure and marrow
   suppression.  2.5L removed.  Pt became oliguric with oncern that
   patient could have worsened volume overload comprimising respiration
   after extubation.  HD catheter  placed and pt dialyzed.  Patient

   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Post transfusion hct has been stable at
   29, no obvious source of bleeding.  Marrow beginning to reconstitute.
   Received Eop with HD
   - transfusion to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head negative for evidence of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic
   disease or emboli. However, given initial path significant for M4 AML
   which is known for CNS spread. Consider toxic/metabolic/hypoxia &
   polypharmacy as most likely etiology of MS changes.
    -continue to renally dose meds, treat hypoxia .
   -will be able to better evaluate when patient extubated, will consider

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, initially
   improved on Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developped bilateral
   lower lobe infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive
   infectious workup has been neg to date, on broad spectrum abx.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   [**12-27**] to reactive pneumonitis, as had responded to steroids.  Clinical
   picture complicated by component of volume overload w/ BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**]
   normal EF, but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone.  SBI
   yesterday showed drop in PO2 to 60.  CXR shows worsening fluid overload
   in oliguric patient.  HD catheter placed yesterday, w/ planned for HD
   today in order to hopefully facilitaty extubation with concern that
   patient would have possibility of flashing w/ elimination of PEEP.
   - Vanc (day 1 [**1-15**]) continues to be supratherapeutic, holding for now,
   HD tow days agao to lower level, still remains elevated
   -  Patient no longer neutrapenic, and levofloxacin d/c yesterday.  Will
   continue meropenem (day 11) / voriconazole (since [**1-7**]), but will
   discuss w/ ID if they feel comfortable stripping off abx.
   - steroids started for reactive pneumonitis now tapered off
   - repeat b-glucan pending
   - Has done well on pressure support w/ PEEP now down to 5 and FIO2 50%
   (increased from 40% overnight.)   Will attempt to extubate
   today/tomorrow following dialysis.  While patient rapid RR contributing
   to alkalosis, some secondary metabolic process also contributing to
   alkalemia likely contraction.
   # AML:  Day 28 s/p induction with 7+3. No longer neutrapecic
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , no longer neutropenic  Avoiding G-CSF.
   - f/u BMT rec
   # ARF
 pt with rising BUN/Creatinine & [**Month (only) 38**] UOP. Muddy brown casts in
   urinary sediment consistent with ATN, etiology unclear.   Creatinine
   plateau not defined yet, waiting on resolution.  UOP did not respond
   approp to Lasix/thiazide/albumin. No Longer hyperkalemic.   Pt required
   HD x1 [**2-2**] for elevated vanc level is setting of renal failure and
   marrow suppression.  2.5L removed.  HD catheter removed after the one
   use.  Pt oliguric yesterday and concern that patient could have
   worsened volume overload comprimising respiration after extubation.  HD
   catheter yesterday placed, but was not dialyzed.  Planed for HD today,
   but patient now making urine.
   - plan  for HD today
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders, increased yesterday
    # Afib
 new, started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter,
   likely due to atrial irritation.  Was temporary controlled on dilt gtt,
   now well controlled in sinus on po meds.  Will follow.
   - continue current regimen
   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Post transfusion hct has been stable at
   29, no obvious source of bleeding.  Marrow beginning to reconstitute.
   Received Eop with HD
   - transfusion to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head negative for evidence of bleed. No clear evidence of metastatic
   disease or emboli. However, given initial path significant for M4 AML
   which is known for CNS spread. Consider toxic/metabolic/hypoxia &
   polypharmacy as most likely etiology of MS changes.
    -continue to renally dose meds, treat hypoxia .
   -will be able to better evaluate when patient extubated, will consider
   MRI if MS [**First Name (Titles) 292**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1479**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after induction with 7+3. The patient's post-induction course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on [**2167-1-27**] and transferred to the ICU.

The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia but improved on antibiotics. However, after induction with 7+3, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS. An extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and the patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. In [**Month (only) 60**], it was believed that the patient had reactive pneumonitis, and steroids were started for treatment. However, the patient's clinical picture is complicated by a component of volume overload, with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**] normal ejection fraction (EF), but infiltrates not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. The patient also experienced a significant drop in oxygen saturation (SpO2) to 60%.

The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) two days ago to lower vancomycin levels, which remained supratherapeutic. The HD catheter was placed yesterday, and the patient is planned"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started treatment on [5-28] [1-6]. However, she developed fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (ARF) while on chemotherapy. She was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure due to ARDS. All cultures have been negative, suggesting a possible steroid-responsive pneumonitis. The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) but requires increased FiO2/PEEP. Her chest X-ray shows no new infiltrates, and she continues to produce urine without evidence of needing dialysis today. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator as tolerated.

The patient also has anemia, which has shown improvement in hematocrit levels. She will undergo bone marrow transplantation following chemotherapy. She is no longer neutropenic and will have levofloxacin added back to her regimen. Broad coverage with meropenem, voriconazole, and vancomycin will be continued. The patient has new right internal jugular (RIJ) dialysis catheter and left percutaneous internal catheter (PICC) inserted.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, improved on
   Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developed bilateral lower lobe
   infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive infectious workup
   has been neg to date, on broad spectrum abx.  [**Month (only) 60**] be [**12-27**] to reactive
   pneumonitis, as it had responded to steroids.  Clinical picture
   complicated by component of volume overload w/ BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**] normal EF,
   but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone.  Pt  tolerated PS but
   persistently tachypneic, RSBI in 80s today, pO2 in 70s.
   - continue Vancomycin, [**Last Name (un) **], Levo, Vori (will recheck vanc level after
   HD & dose accordingly)
   - steroids started for reactive pneumonitis now tapered off
   - rapid RR contributing to alkalosis, ?some secondary metabolic process
   also contributing to alkalemia
   - continue to work towards extubation, addl volume removal via HD,
   reassess ABG after HD
   # Fever
  unclear if this is due to new infection vs re-engraftment.
   Cultures have been NGTD, line site looks good.  Pt may need CT to r/o
   sinusitis vs new pulm process.  Pt spiked this afternoon and was
   re-cultured.
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotics
 vanc, voriconazole, [**Last Name (un) 430**] & levo
   - f/u cultures, consider CT in am
   - consider lower extremity dopplers to r/o DVT
   # AML:  Day 30 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   - f/u BMT rec
   # Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis
pt continues to have
   a respiratory alkalosis [**12-27**] hyperventilation with RR>30.  Etiology
   unclear currently, maintaining pO2 in 70s and working towards
   extubation, but RSBI was high on [**2-6**] & still trying to remove volume
   via HD.  Pt having fevers that may also be contributing to tachypneic
   drive
   - for resp alkalosis
 follow ABGs titrate vent prn decrease RR, inc
   sedation if necessary
    # ARF
Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent with
   ATN.   Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on
   resolution.  UOP did not respond to Lasix/thiazide/albumin. Pt became
   oliguric and concern that patient with worsened volume overload
   comprimising ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been
   getting dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels per renal.
   - plan for HD today, 1upRBCs after HD
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders
    # Afib
started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely
   due to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now
   well controlled in sinus on po meds.
   - continue diltiazem
   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Hct trended down o/n from 29.8 to 24.9,
   will recheck hct after HD and if stable below 25, will transfuse
   1upRBCs
    - transfusion goal to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head neg, however, M4 AML is known for CNS spread that may not be
   appreciable on CT.  Hypoxia & polypharmacy most likely etiology of MS
   changes prior to intubation & unable to properly assess MS [**First Name (Titles) 1646**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 1647**]ted.
   - better evaluate when pt extubated, consider MRI if MS [**First Name (Titles) 292**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1479**]

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3. She presented with febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation and transfer to the ICU.

The patient initially had upper lobe pneumonia that improved with antibiotics. However, after induction chemotherapy, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS. An extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's clinical picture is complicated by volume overload with a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level above normal ejection fraction, but infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) but remained tachypneic with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) in the 80s today, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in the 70s.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory Failure: Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Voriconazole. Start steroids for reactive pneumonitis, now tapered off. Rapid respiratory rate contributing to respiratory alkalosis, possibly secondary to metabolic process. Continue to work towards extubation, additional volume removal via hemodialysis (HD), and reassess arterial blood gas ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. The patient presented with febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation. She was transferred to the ICU and underwent bronchoscopy on [Date]. 

The patient initially had upper lobe pneumonia that improved with antibiotics but then developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, requiring intubation on [Date]. Extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and the patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Steroids were started for reactive pneumonitis and subsequently tapered off. The patient has tolerated pressure support with PEEP now down to 8 and FiO2 50%. She will be attempted to extubate today/tomorrow with aggressive ventilator weaning.

The patient is also experiencing fever, and it is unclear whether it is due to a new infection or re-engraftment. Cultures are ongoing to rule out line site infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), sinusitis, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued, including vancomycin, voriconazole, and levofloxacin.

Other complications include mixed metabolic alkalosis/respiratory alkalosis, acute kidney failure (ARF), atr"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer, and post-polio syndrome. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been experiencing fevers, renal failure, and is on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of being sedated and unable to provide any history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure and ARDS require close monitoring and management. The respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O needs to be adjusted based on the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to the underlying condition.

2. Fever: Despite restarting on levofloxacin, the patient continues to have persistent fevers. It is important to identify the source of infection and consider other potential causes of fever, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection or catheter-related urinary tract infection.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised as indicated by the elevated creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL. Close monitoring of renal parameters and ongoing renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis) are necessary. The goal is to improve renal function and avoid further complications associated with acute kidney injury.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is low"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), post-polio syndrome, and breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has persistent fevers despite being on antibiotics, and her renal function is deteriorating. She is also anemic with a low hemoglobin level.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/73 to 168/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 50% FiO2. She is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 321 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her respiratory system compliance is good with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 88. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is not in acute distress, has symmetric chest expansion, and bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and she has no peripheral edema or muscle wasting. Her neurologic examination shows that she is sedated and not responsive to commands.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following induction therapy with 7+3. She presented with febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated and underwent a bronchoscopy on January 27th. The patient initially had an upper lobe pneumonia, which improved with antibiotics. However, she then developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, leading to her current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing respiratory failure due to ARDS, which has been complicated by volume overload and persistent tachypnea. Efforts are being made to wean her off the ventilator, but she remains dependent on it.

2. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever, which may be due to a new infection or re-engraftment. Sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in pairs, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further investigation is needed to identify the causative organism.

3. Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient has a respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation with a RR >30. The etiology is unclear, and efforts are being made to decrease the RR and maintain adequate oxygenation.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and muddy brown casts are present in the urine sediment, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This may be secondary to her recent dialysis sessions. The patient's fluid overload is also a concern, which is compromising her ability to be extubated.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient developed atrial fibrillation following the insertion of the hemodialysis catheter, likely due to atrial irritation. Her heart rate was initially controlled with diltiazem, and she is now well-controlled on oral medications.

6. Anemia: The patient has been transfusion-dependent since induction therapy and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) on January 30th. Her hemoglobin level trended down overnight, and further transfusions may be required to maintain a target hemoglobin level above 25%.

7. Mental Status Changes: The patient has experienced mental status changes prior to intubation, which may be attributed to hypoxia and polypharmacy. A CT scan of the head has been ordered to evaluate for any central nervous system involvement by the M4 AML.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and management plan."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. She presented with respiratory failure due to upper lobe pneumonia that initially improved on antibiotics but then developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on [**2167-1-27**] and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The infectious workup has been negative to date. The patient tolerated pressure support but remained tachypneic.

Fever is ongoing, and the cause is unclear whether it is due to a new infection or re-engraftment. Sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in pairs. The patient may need a CT scan to rule out sinusitis versus new pulmonary process. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued, along with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and voriconazole. Follow-up cultures will be considered, and a CT scan may be ordered.

The patient's AML is at day 30 post induction with 7+3. Her counts are recovering, and she is no longer neutropenic. Transfusion scales will be followed to transfuse if hemoglobin (Hct) <25 or platelet (plt) <10. Daily ANC monitoring will be done, avoiding G-CSF. Bone marrow transplant recipient follow-up will be done.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fevers, and renal failure. She is sedated and unable to provide her own medical history. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 157/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at 15 cmH2O pressure support. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows increased bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the left, and a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for respiratory failure, fever, renal failure, and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and nosocomial influenza.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The presence of fevers and worsening respiratory status suggests the possibility of VAP. Further investigations, such as a chest CT scan and sputum cultures, are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fevers, and renal failure. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown ongoing fever spikes despite being on multiple antibiotics. There are no new infiltrates on the chest X-ray, so a chest CT scan is ordered for further assessment.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 157/72 to 163/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 40% FiO2. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200.

Laboratory tests reveal leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 116 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 3.6 and 2.5 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels of 6.3 mmol/L. Imaging studies,"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt initially p/w upper lobe PNA, improved on
   Abx. Then, after induction with 7+3 developed bilateral lower lobe
   infiltrates & ARDS, intubated on [**2167-1-27**].  Extensive infectious workup
   has been neg to date, on broad spectrum abx.  [**Month (only) 60**] be [**12-27**] to reactive
   pneumonitis, as it had responded to steroids.  Clinical picture
   complicated by component of volume overload w/ BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**] normal EF,
   but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone.  Pt  tolerated PS but
   persistently tachypneic.  Have had difficulty weening from vent due to
   combination of fluid overload and PEEP dependence.
   - continue Vancomycin, [**Last Name (un) **], Levo, Vori  (vanc level 19 today)
   - steroids started for reactive pneumonitis now tapered off
   - rapid RR contributing to alkalosis, in addition to likely
   contriubtion from contraction alkalosis following HD
   - continue to work towards extubation, addl volume removal via HD
   - CT scan to evaluate worsening of ARDS or development of VAP as
   patient
s vent dependence has increased in the setting of persistent
   fever.
   - will decrease vent settings to PS 8/8/50% to see if can tolerate
   # Fever
  unclear if this is due to new infection vs re-engraftment.
   Sputum GS shows GPC, awaing speciation, otherwise have been NGTD, line
   site looks good.  Pt may need CT to r/o sinusitis vs new pulm process.
   -CT scan today of sinuses/chest.  Will additionally allow liver windows
   to evaluate for hepatic fungal infiltration.
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotics
 vanc, voriconazole, [**Last Name (un) 430**] & levo
   - f/u cultures
   - LENI negative
   # AML:  Day 30 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   - f/u BMT rec
   # Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis
pt continues to have
   a respiratory alkalosis [**12-27**] hyperventilation with RR>30.  Etiology
   unclear currently, maintaining pO2 in 70s and working towards
   extubation.  RR rate reduced w/ higher pressure support
   - for resp alkalosis
 follow ABGs titrate vent prn decrease RR, inc
   sedation if necessary
    # ARF
Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent with
   ATN.   Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on
   resolution.  Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt
   became oliguric and concern that patient with worsened volume overload
   comprimising ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been
   getting dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and
   fluid overload.
   - HD yesterday w/ 2 L revoved, 1upRBCs after HD
   - 250mg of vanc dosed during HD yesterday
   - Cr continues to rise after each HD session
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders
    # Afib
started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely
   due to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now
   well controlled in sinus on po meds.
   - continue diltiazem
   # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, received 2u
   pRBCs on [**1-30**] from hct of 20.  Hct trended down o/n from 29.8 to 24.9,
   will recheck hct after HD and if stable below 25, will transfuse
   1upRBCs
    - transfusion goal to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head neg, however, M4 AML is known for CNS spread that may not be
   appreciable on CT.  Hypoxia & polypharmacy most likely etiology of MS
   changes prior to intubation & unable to properly assess MS [**First Name (Titles) 1646**]

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. The post-induction course has been complicated by febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].

   complicated by component of volume overload w/ BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**] normal EF,
   but infiltrates not likely [**12-27**] pulm edema alone.  Pt  tolerated PS but
   persistently tachypneic.  Have had difficulty weening from vent due to

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following induction therapy with 7+3. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by a left upper lobe pneumonia that improved with antibiotics. However, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation on January 27th. The extensive infectious workup has been negative so far, and she has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's clinical picture is complicated by volume overload with a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 1527, indicating heart failure, but the infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. She has been persistently tachypneic and has had difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to fluid overload and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) dependence. A CT scan showed a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe, which could be caused by various infectious or malignant conditions.

The patient's fever is unclear whether it is due to a new infection or drug-related re-engraftment syndrome. She has been bronchoscoped and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued. Her AML is at day 31 post-induction with 7+3, and her counts are recovering, no longer being neutropenic. She is being monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, polio, and post-polio syndrome. She was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and started treatment on [5-28][1-6]. She has been experiencing fevers, left lower lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and renal failure. She was transferred to the ICU due to progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation. Her condition has been unstable, with ongoing infection despite negative cultures, possible steroid-responsive pneumonitis, and unknown precipitant. She has a cavitating nodule in her left upper lobe, and pleural effusions are likely transudative. The patient's blood tests show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, and glucose levels. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has had multiple interventions, including dialysis, line placements, and chemotherapy. The patient remains critically ill with ongoing respiratory failure, infection, and renal issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: The patient's condition is complicated by ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory distress and potentially require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite negative cultures, the patient continues to have fevers and signs of infection. This could indicate a resistant or unidentified infection that may require further evaluation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3. She developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but extensive infectious workup has been negative. She also has a history of pneumonia, which improved on antibiotics, and bilateral lower lobe infiltrates consistent with ARDS. There is a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe, which could be due to infectious causes like tuberculosis, staphylococcus, klebsiella, anaerobes, fungi, amoebiasis, malignancy such as bronchial carcinoma with metastasis, or other conditions such as Wegener's granulomatosis, rheumatoid nodule, pulmonary infarct, lung abscess, or progressive massive fibrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing respiratory failure, evidenced by persistent hypoxia and the need for mechanical ventilation. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the prolonged intubation time.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload, as indicated by increased body weight, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can compromise weaning from the ventilator and increase the risk of further complications.
3. Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient has respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation, but there is also evidence of metabolic alkalosis. The etiology of the metabolic alkalosis is unclear, and it needs further investigation.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts in the urine, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The ATN is likely due to ischemia from hypotension and nephrotoxic drugs. The patient is oliguric, and there is concern about fluid overload compromising renal function.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient developed atrial fibrillation following the insertion of the hemodialysis catheter. It is likely due to atrial irritation. The patient's heart rate is well controlled with diltiazem.
6. Anemia: The patient has been transfusion-dependent since induction chemotherapy. The goal is to maintain hemoglobin concentration (Hct) above 25%. Hemolysis workup is negative.
7. Mental Status Changes: The patient has had mental status changes prior to intubation, which may be due to hypoxia, polypharmacy, or CNS involvement by the AML. Further evaluation is needed when the patient is extubated.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications that require careful management in the ICU. These include respiratory failure, volume overload, mixed metabolic alkalosis/respiratory alkalosis, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and mental status changes."

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3. The post-induction course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and underwent bronchoscopy on January 27th.

The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia, which improved with antibiotics. However, after induction chemotherapy, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, leading to intubation on January 27th. An extensive infectious workup has been negative, and she has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is believed that the clinical picture may be complicated by reactive pneumonitis, as steroids have been initiated and then tapered off.

The patient also has evidence of volume overload with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >1527 normal, but infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, and a recent CT scan showed a cavitating lesion at the site of a former nodule in the left upper lobe. The differential diagnosis for the cavitating lesion includes infectious causes such as tuberculosis (TB), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, anaerobes, fungi, and amoebiasis; malignant causes such as bron"

   ARF and progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection
   w/u unrevealing, transferred  to ICU for progressive hypoxemia,
   intubated for respiratory failure, ards. Failure to wean due to
   tachypnea, O2 requirements.
    1.  Respiratory failure with ARDS, unknown precipitant,all cultures
   negative, possible steroid responsive pneumonitis initially, off
   steroids as of [**2-3**]. Has been tolerating PSV but continues to be PEEP
   dependent. CT now shows LUL cavitating nodule - BAL showed 1+ polys, no
   organisms, rest pending.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after induction with 7+3 chemotherapy. The patient developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia, which improved with antibiotics. However, after induction with 7+3, the patient developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS. Extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and the patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient has a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe, which could be due to various causes including infectious agents such as tuberculosis, staphylococcus, klebsiella, anaerobes, fungi, amoebiasis; malignant conditions like bronchial carcinoma with metastasis; or other conditions like Wegener's granulomatosis, rheumatoid nodule, pulmonary infarct, lung abscess, or progressive massive fibrosis.

The patient is also experiencing fluid overload, which is compromising the ability to extubate. A hemodialysis (HD) catheter has been placed, and the patient has been receiving dialysis for supratherapeutic vancomycin levels (now resolved) and fluid overload.

Additionally, the patient has developed atrial fibr"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction therapy with 7+3. She developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation on [**2167-1-27**].

She initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia that improved with antibiotics but subsequently developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS. Extensive infectious workup has been negative, and she has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. In [**Month (only) 60**], a reactive pneumonitis was suspected, and steroids were started for treatment.

The patient has also shown signs of volume overload with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >1527 (normal EF), but infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. She has been unable to tolerate weaning from the ventilator due to fluid overload and dependence on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). A CT scan has been ordered to evaluate for worsening of ARDS or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as the patient's ventilator dependence has increased in the setting of persistent fevers.

The differential diagnosis for the cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe includes infectious causes such as tuberculosis (TB), Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, anaerobes,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She was admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure due to ARDS. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She has been unable to be weaned off the ventilator due to tachypnea and ongoing need for supplemental oxygen. Her recent CT scan shows a left upper lobe cavitating nodule, and her BAL results showed 1+ polys without organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure has been ongoing, and despite initial concerns for steroid-responsive pneumonitis, she continues to be PEEP-dependent. The cavitating nodule seen on the CT scan raises concern for an active infectious process resulting in cavitation.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has oliguria and likely has a mixed pre-renal azotemia picture. She was previously dialyzed for elevated Vancomycin levels and is now being considered for oliguric RF. Hemodialysis is planned per renal team.
3. Fever of unknown origin: The patient continues to be febrile, and cultures have been negative. There is a possibility of drug fever or nonresolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have improved"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has undergone induction therapy with 7+3 and has developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which may be due to a new infection, drug fever, or re-engraftment.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to fluid overload and PEEP dependence. A CT scan has shown a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe, and there is a differential diagnosis for this lesion.
3. AML: The patient is on day 34 post induction with 7+3. Her counts are recovering, and she is no longer neutropenic.
4. Metabolic alkalosis/respiratory alkalosis: The patient has a mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory alkalosis, possibly due to hyperventilation.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and there are muddy brown casts in the urine, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She has been receiving dialysis due to supratherapeutic vancomycin levels and fluid overload.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had an upper lobe pneumonia that improved with antibiotics, but then developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, requiring intubation.
2. Infectious Workup: The patient has had extensive infectious workup, including sputum cultures, blood cultures, and urine cultures, which have been negative to date. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and voriconazole.
3. Pneumonitis: The patient has a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe, which could be due to various causes such as tuberculosis, staphylococcal infection, klebsiella infection, anaerobic infection, fungal infection, amoebiasis, malignancy, bronchial carcinoma with metastasis, Wegener's granulomatosis, rheumatoid nodule, pulmonary infarct, lung abscess, or progressive massive fibrosis. Further diagnostic tests, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy, may be necessary to determine the exact cause.
4. Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient continues to have respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation with a respiratory rate >30. The etiology is unclear, and she is being maintained on oxygen supplementation.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts in the urine, consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is oliguric and anuric, requiring dialysis for fluid overload and supratherapeutic vancomycin levels.
6. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient developed atrial fibrillation after the insertion of the hemodialysis catheter, likely due to atrial irritation. Her heart rate is controlled with diltiazem.
7. Anemia: The patient has been transfusion-dependent since induction chemotherapy.
8. Mental Status Changes: The patient has experienced mental status changes prior to intubation, which may be related to hypoxia, polypharmacy, or central nervous system involvement by the AML.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided progress note."

    68 yo F w/ h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syn, recently dx
d AML
   started on [**5-28**] [**1-6**], course c/b fevers, LUL pna, volume overload, ARF
   and progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred  to ICU for progressive hypoxemia, intubated
   for respiratory failure, ards. Failure to wean due to tachypnea, O2
   requirements.
   1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: day 15 intubation. Unknown
   precipitant,all cultures negative, possible steroid responsive
   pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of [**2-3**].
   Put back on PSV. Peep decreased since yesterday.
   CT now shows LUL cavitating nodule - BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms,
   rest pending.   Repeat CT shows little change if any.
   Peural effusions, too small to tap. Unclear if empyema vs more likely
   transudate.
   2.  ARF with oliguria: likely a mixed pre-renal atn picture (muddy
   brown casts on u/a). Was dialysed for elevated Vanco level, now for
   oliguric RF. HD per renal. 2.3 L off yesterday.
   3. ID/Fevers: non-neutropenic now, continues to be febrile,
   levofloxacin added back last week. Continue broad coverage with
   Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] ([**1-26**])/Levo/voriconazole ([**1-7**]). Appreciate ID input.
   Cultures so far negative. Possibility of drug fever vs nonresolving VAP
   vs empyema vs pancreatitis (TG 900).
   4. Anemia: improved hct, stable
   5. AML/Chemotherapy: BMT following.
   6. Lines - new R IJ dial catheter [**2-4**], and new left PICC inserted [**2-2**]
   7. Afib

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She was admitted to the ICU due to progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. The patient has been intubated since day 15 and has been experiencing fevers, volume overload, acute renal failure (ARF), and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Her condition is complicated by a cavitating nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung, which showed 1+ polys on BAL but no organisms. The patient also has pericardial effusions, likely transudates, and has undergone hemodialysis for elevated vancomycin levels and oliguric RF. She remains febrile despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and has negative cultures so far. The patient's prognosis is guarded overall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure has progressed to ARDS, leading to the need for intubation. The cause of ARDS is unknown, and it has not responded to steroids. The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation support.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient presents with oliguria and evidence of pre-renal azotemia. She has been dialyzed for elevated vancomycin levels and ongoing oliguric RF. The exact cause of ARF is still unclear.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after induction therapy with 7+3. She presented with febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated and received a bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].

The patient initially presented with upper lobe pneumonia that improved with antibiotics. However, after induction therapy with 7+3, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS. Extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and she has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. In December, she was diagnosed with reactive pneumonitis, and the clinical picture was complicated by volume overload. CT scans showed worsening ARDS and a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe, which is being followed up. 

The patient has been experiencing fevers, and the source is unclear, possibly due to a new infection, re-engraftment, or drug fever. She has been receiving various medications including voriconazole, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. The patient's mental status changes were noted prior to intubation, and her renal function has deteriorated with rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts in the sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. She presented with respiratory failure, initially with upper lobe pneumonia that improved on antibiotics. Subsequently, she developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation on [**2167-1-27**]. An extensive infectious workup has been negative, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's clinical picture is complicated by volume overload with a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of >[**Numeric Identifier 1527**] normal EF, but the infiltrates are not likely due to pulmonary edema alone. She tolerated pressure support (PS) but remains persistently tachypneic. There has been difficulty weaning her from the ventilator due to fluid overload and dependence on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). A CT scan revealed a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe, which may be due to an infectious cause such as tuberculosis (TB), staphylococcus, klebsiella, anaerobes, fungi, amoebiasis; malignancy-related causes such as bronchial carcinoma with metastasis; or other causes such as Wegener's granulomatosis, rheumatoid nodule, pulmonary inf"

   Assessment and Plan
    68 yo F w/ h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syn, recently dx
d AML
   started on [**5-28**] [**1-6**], course c/b fevers, LUL pna, volume overload, ARF
   and progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred  to ICU for progressive hypoxemia, intubated
   for respiratory failure, ards. Failure to wean due to tachypnea, O2
   requirements.
   1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: day 16 intubation.
   Unknown precipitant,all cultures negative, possible steroid responsive
   pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of [**2-3**].
   Put back on PSV. Peep decreased since yesterday. Tolerating PSV except
   for tachypnea. Will wean peep and obtain SBT. Possible extubation
   today.
   CT now shows LUL cavitating nodule which is likely pneumatocoele.
   BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms, rest pending.
   Peural effusions, too small to tap per IP. Doubt empyema.
   2.  ARF with oliguria: likely a mixed pre-renal atn picture (muddy
   brown casts on u/a). Was dialysed for elevated Vanco level, now for
   oliguric RF. HD per renal. 2.3 L off [**2-11**]. Being dialysed now.
   3. ID/Fevers: non-neutropenic now, but continues to be febrile,
   levofloxacin added back last week. On broad coverage with
   Vanco/Levo/voriconazole ([**1-7**]). Appreciate ID input.  [**Last Name (un) **] d/c'd [**2-13**].
   Cultures so far negative. Possibility of drug fever vs leukemia-induced
   vs nonresolving VAP vs empyema.
   4. Anemia: improved hct, stable
   5. AML/Chemotherapy: BMT following.
   6. Lines - new R IJ dial catheter [**2-4**], and new left PICC inserted [**2-2**]
   7. Afib
 on dilt
   8. Sedation - on propofol. Started on versed/fentanyl [**2-12**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She was admitted to the ICU due to progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated since day 16. She has developed fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute kidney injury, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: The patient is on pressure-controlled ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O and a plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O. She remains oliguric with urine output of 2.1 L/24 hours. The latest arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.46, PaCO2 28 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 150, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 10.6 L/min. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) except for tachypnea. It is planned to wean the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and obtain a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for possible extubation today.

2. Acute kidney injury (RF): The patient has oliguria with a urine"

   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequt study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of ARF.
   Patient tolaterated [**3-30**] PS yesterday, and was looking to be extubated
   today.  Following RSBI, patient became increasingly tachypnic, w/ low
   tidal volumes.  Unclear if from agitation vs. mucous plugging vs. air
   leaking vs. PE.
   - repeat CXR and sunctioning
   - ativan for anxiety, then reassess ABG
   - EKG to look for RH strain
   - continue Levo, Vori, d/[**Initials (NamePattern5) 1739**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) **], now d/c vanc
   - continue to work towards extubation aggressively, will avoid further
   dialysis though as feel that -3.5L yesterday contributing to today
   difficulties.
   - pt approacing critical juncture where decision may need to be made
   about trach and peg, will try very hard to extubate patient, as
   longterm prognosis from heme-onc standpoint very poor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3 chemotherapy. She developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed ARDS following induction chemotherapy and has been intubated since. There is difficulty in weaning from the ventilator due to persistent fevers, volume overload in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), and uncertain etiology.
2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers of unknown origin, with sputum yeast and negative fungal culture. Drug fever is suspected, especially with the use of voriconazole.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts in sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is oliguric and anuric, requiring dialysis.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient developed atrial fibrillation following the insertion of the hemodialysis catheter.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3. She presented with febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].

She initially had upper lobe pneumonia that improved with antibiotics but then developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and ARDS, leading to intubation on [**2167-1-27**]. The extensive infectious workup has been negative to date, and she has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also had a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe, which improved on the left but worsened on the right. Differential diagnoses for the cavitating lesion include infectious causes like tuberculosis, staphylococcal infection, klebsiella infection, anaerobic infection, fungi, amoebiasis, malignancy (bronchial carcinoma with metastasis), Wegener's disease, rheumatoid nodule, pulmonary infarct, lung abscess, and progressive massive fibrosis. Further evaluation with a BAL and repeat chest CT is planned.

The patient is currently recovering from febrile neutropenia and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 154/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on FiO2 50%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure support of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 1.6 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 23.8%, platelet count of 160 K/uL, creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 38 mg/dL, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, glucose level of 83 mg/dL, and lactate level of 0.6 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 21 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 218 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 90%.

Imaging studies reveal diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persisting essentially unchanged from the previous study, which could reflect widespread infection as well as ARDS. The radiographic appearance does not suggest pulmonary edema alone.

The patient has a history of mixed metabolic alkalosis/respiratory alkalosis, acute kidney injury (AKI), atrial fibrillation (Afib), anemia, and mental status changes. Further evaluations and treatments are planned for each of these conditions.

The patient's overall prognosis is poor due to the underlying hematological malignancy, and long-term treatment options are limited. The medical team is working towards extubation and aggressive weaning from mechanical ventilation, with a goal of extubation later today."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She was admitted to the ICU due to progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has been experiencing fevers, volume overload, acute renal failure (ARF), and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Her blood cultures have been negative, and imaging shows a cavitating nodule in the left upper lobe, which is likely a pneumatocoele. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed 1+ polys without organisms. The patient has also been diagnosed with anemia, which has improved with transfusions. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage. The patient's prognosis is guarded, and the plan is to continue with full code status, aim for extubation if tolerated, and rediscuss goals and code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and has been intubated due to ARDS. She may continue to have difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
2. Anuric ARF: The patient has acute renal failure and is oliguric, meaning she is producing very little urine. This can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She was started on chemotherapy on [**5-28**] [**1-6**] but developed fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing. The patient was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been unable to wean off the ventilator due to tachypnea and oxygen requirements.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: The patient tolerated pressure support 5/5 well until [**2-14**] AM when she desaturated and increased respiratory rate after respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). She appeared to have ventilator dyssynchrony with anxiety. Ativan 1 mg IV TID seems to be helping a little. Low-dose prn morphine will be added.
2. Anuric ARF: The patient likely has a mixed pre-renal acute tubular necrosis (ATN) picture (muddy brown casts on urinalysis). She was dialyzed for elevated vancomycin level and now for oliguric renal failure. Hemodialysis (HD) will be performed per renal failure guidelines.
3. ID/Fevers: The patient continues to be febrile, despite being non-neutropenic. Levofloxacin was added back last week. The patient is on levofloxacin and voriconazole ([**1-7**]). There is a question of drug fever versus leukemia/blasts. After discussion with [**Last Name (LF) 1763**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] discontinued voriconazole. Repeat urine checking for yeast (+ on [**2-11**] but not on [**2-13**]).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has improved and is stable. She received a blood transfusion yesterday with an appropriate rise.
5. AML/Chemotherapy: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is planned following chemotherapy.
6. Lines - new right internal jugular (RIJ) dialysis catheter [**2-4**], and new left peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) inserted [**2-2**]
7. Atrial fibrillation on diltiazem.
8. Sedation - minimal sedation, ativan + prn morphine. Propofol caused hypertriglyceridemia.

Prognosis is guarded overall. A family meeting was held on [**2-13**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 175"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequt study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of ARF.
   Patient tolaterated weaning on pressure support, however, despite good
   gases, is extremely tachypneic to the 40s.
   - repeat CXR and sunctioning
   - ativan for anxiety
   - will add prn morphine
   - continue Levo, Vori
   - continue to work towards extubation aggressively
   - pt approacing critical juncture where decision may need to be made
   about trach and peg, will try very hard to extubate patient, as
   longterm prognosis from heme-onc standpoint very poor
    # Fever
  unclear if this is due to new infection vs drug fever
   Sputum Yeast in urine Cx, but patient on voriconazole, will d/c foley.
   CT showed cavitating lesion left upper lobe.
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern5) 1739**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 430**] ([**2-12**]) for suspicion of drug fever
   - d/c vanc ([**2-13**]) with persistent rash c/w drug rash
   - f/u BAL
   - effusions too small to tap per IR
   - f/u cultures
   - LENI negative
   - CT of chest shows cavitary lesion unlikely infectious
   - will do peripheral cx as well
   # AML:  Day 40 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - per BMT, prognosis poor, on order of months, will not be able to give
   further treatment while intubated
   -  transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   -  monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   -  f/u BMT rec
   - likely will re-marrow for w/u fever of unknown origin
   # Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis
pt continues to have
   a respiratory alkalosis [**12-27**] hyperventilation with RR>30.  Etiology
   unclear currently, maintaining pO2 in 70s and working towards
   extubation.  RR rate reduced w/ higher pressure support
   Resolved.
     # ARF
 Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent
   with ATN.   Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on
   resolution.  Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt
   became oliguric and concern that patient with worsened volume overload
   compromising ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been
   getting dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and
   fluid overload.  Pt now oligure/anuric requiring dialysis.  Uncertain
   if ever will regain ability to make urine.
   - appreciate renal rec
   - HD tomorrow
   - cont phos binders
   # Afib
started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely due
   to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now
   well controlled in sinus on po meds.
   - continue diltiazem
    # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction,.
   - transfusion goal to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head neg, however, M4 AML is known for CNS spread that may not be
   appreciable on CT.  Hypoxia & polypharmacy most likely etiology of MS
   changes prior to intubation & unable to properly assess MS [**First Name (Titles) 1646**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3 chemotherapy. She was admitted to the ICU due to febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated since then.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed ARDS following induction chemotherapy and has been difficult to wean from the ventilator. There is an ongoing effort to work towards extubation, but the patient remains extremely tachypneic.
2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, and it is unclear if this is due to a new infection or drug fever. Sputum yeast in urine culture was positive, but the patient is already on voriconazole. A CT scan showed a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe, and further investigations are needed.
3. AML: The patient is on day 40 post induction with 7+3 chemotherapy. Her counts are recovering, and she is no longer neutropenic. However, the prognosis is poor, with an expected survival of only a few months. Further treatment options are limited while the patient remains intubated.
4. Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient continues to have respiratory alkalosis due to hyperv"

   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequt study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of ARF.
   Patient tolaterated weaning on pressure support, however, despite good
   gases, is extremely tachypneic to the 40s.
   - repeat CXR and sunctioning
   - ativan for anxiety
   - will add prn morphine
   - continue Levo, Vori
   - continue to work towards extubation aggressively
   - pt approacing critical juncture where decision may need to be made
   about trach and peg, will try very hard to extubate patient, as
   longterm prognosis from heme-onc standpoint very poor
    # Fever

   - f/u BAL
   - effusions too small to tap per IR
   - f/u cultures
   - LENI negative
   - CT of chest shows cavitary lesion unlikely infectious
   - will do peripheral cx as well
   # AML:  Day 40 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - per BMT, prognosis poor, on order of months, will not be able to give
   further treatment while intubated
   -  transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   -  monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   -  f/u BMT rec
   - likely will re-marrow for w/u fever of unknown origin
   # Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis
pt continues to have
   a respiratory alkalosis [**12-27**] hyperventilation with RR>30.  Etiology
   unclear currently, maintaining pO2 in 70s and working towards
   extubation.  RR rate reduced w/ higher pressure support
   Resolved.
     # ARF
 Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent
   with ATN.   Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on
   resolution.  Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt
   became oliguric and concern that patient with worsened volume overload
   compromising ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been
   getting dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and
   fluid overload.  Pt now oligure/anuric requiring dialysis.  Uncertain
   if ever will regain ability to make urine.
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders
   # Afib
started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely due
   to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now
   well controlled in sinus on po meds.
   - continue diltiazem
    # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction,.
   - transfusion goal to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head neg, however, M4 AML is known for CNS spread that may not be
   appreciable on CT.  Hypoxia & polypharmacy most likely etiology of MS
   changes prior to intubation & unable to properly assess MS [**First Name (Titles) 1646**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following induction therapy with 7+3. She has been experiencing febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**]. She is currently in the ICU and has been difficult to wean from the ventilator due to developing persistent fevers, a cavitary lesion on repeat CT scan, and volume overload in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed ARDS following induction chemotherapy and has been intubated since. She is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to persistent fevers and volume overload.
2. Fever: The patient has been having persistent fevers, which are unclear if they are due to a new infection or drug fever. There is a sputum yeast in urine culture, but the patient is on voriconazole, and Foley catheter will be discontinued.
3. AML: The patient is on day 40 post-induction with 7+3. Her counts are recovering, and she is no longer neutropenic. However, the prognosis is poor, and she will not be able to receive further treatment while intubated.

   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   # Respiratory Failure
 Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequt study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of ARF.
   Patient tolaterated weaning on pressure support, however, despite good
   gases, is extremely tachypneic to the 40s.
   - repeat CXR and sunctioning
   - ativan for anxiety
   - will add prn morphine
   - continue Levo, Vori
   - continue to work towards extubation aggressively
   - pt approacing critical juncture where decision may need to be made
   about trach and peg, will try very hard to extubate patient, as
   longterm prognosis from heme-onc standpoint very poor
    # Fever
  unclear if this is due to new infection vs drug fever
   Sputum Yeast in urine Cx, but patient on voriconazole, will d/c foley.
   CT showed cavitating lesion left upper lobe.
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern5) 1739**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 430**] ([**2-12**]) for suspicion of drug fever
   - d/c vanc ([**2-13**]) with persistent rash c/w drug rash
   - f/u BAL
   - effusions too small to tap per IR
   - f/u cultures
   - LENI negative
   - CT of chest shows cavitary lesion unlikely infectious
   - will do peripheral cx as well
   # AML:  Day 40 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - per BMT, prognosis poor, on order of months, will not be able to give
   further treatment while intubated
   -  transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   -  monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   -  f/u BMT rec
   - likely will re-marrow for w/u fever of unknown origin
   # Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis
pt continues to have
   a respiratory alkalosis [**12-27**] hyperventilation with RR>30.  Etiology
   unclear currently, maintaining pO2 in 70s and working towards
   extubation.  RR rate reduced w/ higher pressure support
   Resolved.
     # ARF
 Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent
   with ATN.   Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on
   resolution.  Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt
   became oliguric and concern that patient with worsened volume overload
   compromising ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been
   getting dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and
   fluid overload.  Pt now oligure/anuric requiring dialysis.  Uncertain
   if ever will regain ability to make urine.
   - appreciate renal rec
   - HD tomorrow
   - cont phos binders
   # Afib
started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely due
   to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now
   well controlled in sinus on po meds.
   - continue diltiazem
    # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction,.
   - transfusion goal to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head neg, however, M4 AML is known for CNS spread that may not be
   appreciable on CT.  Hypoxia & polypharmacy most likely etiology of MS

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post induction with 7+3 chemotherapy. The patient has been experiencing complications since post-induction, including febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated since then.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The repeat CT scan showed a cavitary lesion but was later determined to be consistent with a pneumatocele. The patient tolerated pressure support but remained extremely tachypneic.

Fever is present, and the cause is unclear whether it is due to a new infection or drug fever. Sputum yeast in the urine culture, but the patient is already on voriconazole. The CT scan also showed a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe. Further evaluation is needed, including a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral cultures.

The patient's AML status is day 40 post induction with 7+3 chemotherapy, and her counts are recovering, no longer neutropenic. However, the prognosis is poor, with an expected survival of only a few months. No further treatment can be provided while the patient remains intubated.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with rising creatinine levels and muddy brown"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo F w/ h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syn, recently dx
d AML
   started on [**5-28**] [**1-6**], course c/b fevers, LUL pna, volume overload, ARF
   and progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred  to ICU for progressive hypoxemia, intubated
   for respiratory failure, ards. Failure to wean due to tachypnea, O2
   requirements.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated ~19 days so far
   - desatted and increased resp fate [**2-14**]
   - now appears to have partial ET tube obstruction
        - will bronch urgently
   - per prior notes:  Prev hx: unknown precipitant,all cultures negative,
   possible steroid responsive pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of
   [**2-3**].  CT shows LUL cavitating nodule which is likely pneumatocoele.
   BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms, rest pending.  Pleural effusions,
   too small to tap per IP. Doubt empyema.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   Per prior notes: likely a mixed pre-renal atn picture (muddy brown
   casts on u/a). Was dialysed for elevated Vanco level, now for oliguric
   RF. HD per renal. 2.3 L off [**2-11**], 3.5L off [**2-13**]. On HD today.
   FEVERS
   No clear source; appreciate ID's help.
   3. ID/Fevers: non-neutropenic now, but continues to be febrile,
   levofloxacin added back last week.
   On Levo/voriconazole ([**1-7**]). Question of drug fever vs leukemia/blasts.
   After discussion [**Last Name (LF) 1763**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c voriconazole.
   Repeat urine checking for yeast (+ on [**2-11**] but not on [**2-13**]).
   Appreciate ID input.  Vanco last dose 3/20. [**Last Name (un) **] d/c'd [**2-13**].
   Cultures so far negative. Possibility of drug fever vs leukemia-induced
   vs nonresolving VAP vs empyema.
   4. Anemia: improved hct, stable. Last transfusion yesterday with
   appropriate rise.
   5. AML/Chemotherapy: BMT following.
   6. Lines - new R IJ dial catheter [**2-4**], and new left PICC inserted [**2-2**]
   7. Afib
 on dilt
   8. Sedation - minimal sedation, ativan + prn morphine. Propofol caused
   hypertrigliceridemia.
   Prognosis guarded overall. Family meeting was held [**2-13**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] and
   I were present. All questions answered. Plan is to keep full code, aim
   for extubation, then rediscuss goals and code status.

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The patient has been experiencing fevers, volume overload, acute renal failure, and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing. She has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and levofloxacin, but her urine cultures have been negative. The patient also has a history of unknown precipitant, all cultures negative, possible steroid-responsive pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of [**2-3**]. CT shows a left upper lobe (LUL) cavitating nodule which is likely a pneumatocoele. BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms, rest pending. Pleural effusions, too small to tap per IP. Doubt empyema.

The patient has been on dialysis for elevated vancomycin levels and now for oliguric renal failure. She has received chemotherapy for AML and is planned for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) following. The patient is also on anticoagulation therapy for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Measures have been taken to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including head of bed elevation, mouth care"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**].
   1. Tacychardia: patient tachycardic to 120s this AM. NG suction unable
   to pass. Bronched during rounds, also unable to pass. ET tube changed,
   found large mucous plug.
   2. Respiratory Failure: Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequt study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of ARF.
   Patient tolaterated weaning on pressure support, however, despite good
   gases, is extremely tachypneic to the 40s.
   - daily CXR and frequent suctioning
   - ativan for anxiety
   - will add prn morphine
   - continue Levofloxacin, Voriconazole
   - continue to work towards extubation aggressively
   - pt approacing critical juncture where decision may need to be made
   about trach and peg, will try very hard to extubate patient, as
   longterm prognosis from heme-onc standpoint very poor
    # Fever
 unclear if this is due to new infection vs drug fever
   Sputum Yeast in urine Cx, but patient on voriconazole, will d/c foley.
   CT showed cavitating lesion left upper lobe, fungus vs pneumatocoele
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern5) 1739**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 430**] ([**2-12**]) for suspicion of drug fever,  d/c vanc ([**2-13**]) with
   persistent rash c/w drug rash
   - f/u cultures
   - LENI negative
   - CT of chest shows cavitary lesion unlikely infectious
   - change voriconizole from IV to PO
   - ID consult appreciated, will hold off currently on bone marrow bx
   - Per ID will repeat Chest CT [**2-19**]
   - Will culture all lines when spikes.
   # AML:  Day 40 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - per BMT, prognosis poor, on order of months, will not be able to give
   further treatment while intubated
   -  transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   -  monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   -  f/u BMT rec
   - will consider re-marrow for w/u fever of unknown origin
     # ARF
 Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent
   with ATN.  Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on
   resolution.  Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt
   became oliguric and concern that patient with worsened volume overload
   compromising ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been
   getting dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and
   fluid overload.  Pt now oligure/anuric requiring dialysis.  Uncertain
   if ever will regain ability to make urine.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders
   - Patient will need HD line changed soon, consider placing tunnelled
   line, but high risk given fever of [**Last Name (un) 1780**] origin.
   # Afib
started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely due
   to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now
   well controlled in sinus on po meds.
   - continue diltiazem
    # Anemia
 has been transfusion dependant s/p induction,.
   - transfusion goal to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Mental Status changes
 MS changes noted on day prior to intubation.
   CT Head neg, however, M4 AML is known for CNS spread that may not be
   appreciable on CT.  Hypoxia & polypharmacy most likely etiology of MS
   changes prior to intubation & unable to properly assess MS [**First Name (Titles) 1646**]

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1395**] developed worse respiratory distress this morning, with HR
   and RR elevation.  We were unable to successfully pass a suction
   catheter.  I proceeded with bronchoscopy, which showed that her
   endotracheal was mostly occluded by inspissated secretions.  We
   consulted anesthesia, and proceeded to extubate her and then
   reintubate.  Her tube was markedly occluded with secretions.
   Her other major issues today have been ongoing tachycardia and
   recrudescent fever.
   A/P
   68-year-old woman with h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syn, recently
   dx
d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with a
   complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred  to ICU for progressive hypoxemia, intubated
   for respiratory failure, and ARDS. Today, it appeared that she had
   partial endotracheal tube obstruction, and this was confirmed by
   bronchoscopy and we reintubated her.
   1. Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: day 19 intubation.
   Tolerated PS 5/5 very well until [**2-14**] AM when desaturated and increase
   RR after RSBI.  This may have represented partial tube obstruction, but
   this will take a day or two to sort out since she derecruited some
   during the exchange.
   Prev hx (per notes): unknown precipitant,all cultures negative,
   possible steroid responsive pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of
   [**2-3**].  CT shows LUL cavitating nodule which is likely pneumatocoele.
   BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms, rest pending.  Pleural effusions,
   too small to tap per IP. Doubt empyema.
   2.  Anuric ARF: on HD per renal
   3. ID/Fevers: non-neutropenic now, but continues to be febrile.  No
   clear etiology; cultures so far negative. Possibility of drug fever vs
   leukemia-induced vs nonresolving VAP vs empyema.
   4. Anemia: stable
   5. AML/Chemotherapy: BMT following.
   Case discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has had a complicated course with fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She was transferred to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure and ARDS. Today, it appeared that she had partial endotracheal tube obstruction, which was confirmed by bronchoscopy, and she was reintubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The partial endotracheal tube obstruction may indicate a risk of recurrent obstruction or further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Anuric ARF: The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and requires dialysis due to acute kidney injury (AKI). There is a concern for fluid overload and the need for ongoing renal support.
3. ID/Fevers: The patient continues to be febrile despite negative cultures. Possible etiologies include drug fever, leukemia-induced infection, nonresolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or empyema.
4. Anemia: The patient has been transfusion-dependent since induction chemotherapy. Monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is important for managing anemia.

   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**], still on vent, now on PSV, ET
   tube change [**2-16**] because clogged.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequt study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of ARF.
   Patient tolaterated weaning on pressure support, however, despite good
   gases, is extremely tachypneic to the 40s.  Patient was bronched
   [**2167-2-16**] during rounds, mucous pluggig in ET tube, and ET tube was
   changed.
   - [**2-18**] decrease PSV settings to [**9-2**] (from 15/10) ABG on this
   7.46/33/102/24, pCO2 inproving. PO2 appropriate
   - daily CXR and frequent suctioning
   - ativan for anxiety
   - will add prn morphine
   - continue Voriconazole for cavitary lesion
   - continue to work towards extubation
   - pt approacing critical juncture where decision may need to be made
   about trach and peg, will try very hard to extubate patient, as
   longterm prognosis from heme-onc standpoint very poor
   - consider trach pending family meeting, has been intubated 3weeks
   Fever of Unknown Origen: unclear if this is due to infection vs drug
   fever vs AML related.   Sputum Yeast in urine Cx, but patient on
   voriconazole, will d/c foley.  CT showed cavitating lesion left upper
   lobe, fungus vs pneumatocoele

   - Per ID will repeat Chest CT [**2-19**]
   - Will culture all lines when spikes.
   - per ID consider changing lines
   - consider Abd CT for abscess or other etiology of fever
   - consider actinomyces or nocardia given cavitary lesion on CT
   AML:  Day 40 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - per BMT, prognosis poor, on order of months, will not be able to give
   further treatment while intubated
   -  transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   -  monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   -  BMT recs appreceated: will hold off on bone marrow bx for now as
   counts are improving and no blasts on diff.
   ARF: Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent with
   ATN.  Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on resolution.
   Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt became oliguric
   and concern that patient with worsened volume overload compromising
   ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been getting
   dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and fluid
   overload.  Pt now oligure/anuric requiring dialysis.  Uncertain if ever
   will regain ability to make urine.
   - continue HD for now, due [**2-18**]
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders
   - Patient will need HD line changed soon, consider placing tunnelled
   line, but high risk given fever of [**Last Name (un) 1780**] origin.
   Afib: started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely due
   to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3. Post-induction, the patient developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated and transferred to the ICU.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since then and has had multiple complications. She developed a cavitary lesion on the left upper lobe of her lungs, which is suspected to be either a fungal infection or a pneumatocoele. The patient also had a fever of unknown origin, which could be due to infection, drug fever, or AML-related causes. Despite being on voriconazole, the patient's sputum yeast in urine culture was positive, but it was later found to be a contamination. Blood cultures have been negative to date.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, and she has been difficult to wean from the ventilator. She tolerated pressure support but became extremely tachypneic, leading to the partial occlusion of the endotracheal (ET) tube. The ET tube was changed, and she is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient's AML counts are recovering, and she is no longer neutropenic. However, her renal function is worsening, with rising creatinine"

   Respiratory Failure: Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequt study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of ARF.
   Patient tolaterated weaning on pressure support, however, despite good

   counts are improving and no blasts on diff.
   ARF: Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent with
   ATN.  Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on resolution.
   Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt became oliguric

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following induction chemotherapy. She presented with febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and underwent bronchoscopy. She developed cavitary lesions in the left upper lobe, which were initially thought to be infectious but were later determined to be more consistent with a penumatocele. 

The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator due to persistent fevers and volume overload in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI). She tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) but remained extremely tachypneic. The endotracheal tube became occluded with thick secretions, leading to its replacement. 

The patient's fever of unknown origin is still unresolved, and she has been on voriconazole for a cavitary lesion. Blood cultures have been negative to date. A CT scan of the chest showed a cavitary lesion, but it is unclear whether it is infectious or due to a penumatocele. 

The patient's AML is at day 40 post-induction with 7+3 chemotherapy. Her blood counts are recovering, and she is no longer neutropenic. However, her prognosis remains poor, with an estimated survival of only a few months.

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following induction chemotherapy. She presented with febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation and transfer to the ICU.

Since admission, the patient has had persistent fevers, difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to ARDS and volume overload, and development of a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung. The etiology of the cavitary lesion is unclear, with possibilities including infection or a complication of chemotherapy. The patient was found to have yeast in her urine culture but is currently on voriconazole, so this is likely a drug-related finding.

The patient's blood cultures have been negative to date. Her renal function has deteriorated, with rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts in the urine, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She has become oliguric and anuric, requiring dialysis. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, anemia, mental status changes, and a mixed metabolic alkalosis/respiratory alkalosis that has resolved.

The patient's prognosis is poor, with an expected survival of only a few months due to her underlying hematologic malignancy. The medical team is working towards extubation, but this will depend on the resolution of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P
   68-year-old woman with h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syndrome,
   recently dx
d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with
   a complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred  to ICU for progressive hypoxemia, intubated
   for respiratory failure, and ARDS.
   Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: day 20 intubation.
   Yesterday, it appeared that she had partial endotracheal tube
   obstruction, and this was confirmed by bronchoscopy and we reintubated
   her.
   Will decrease her PEEP today.
   It appears as if she may have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic
   component to ongoing respiratory failure.
   Prev hx (per notes): unknown precipitant,all cultures negative,
   possible steroid responsive pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of
   [**2-3**].  CT shows LUL cavitating nodule which is likely pneumatocoele.
   BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms, rest pending.  Pleural effusions,
   too small to tap per IP. Doubt empyema.
   Anuric ARF: on HD per renal
   Will likely need line changed soon.
   Fevers
   Non-neutropenic now, but continues to be febrile.  No clear etiology;
   cultures so far negative. Possibility of drug fever vs leukemia-induced
   vs nonresolving VAP vs empyema.
   Anemia:
   Slow trend down.  Receiving blood today.
   AML
   BMT following.
   Weakness
   Re-examine in afternoon.  If persists, consider consulting neurology
   regarding help in specifying diagnosis (ICU neuro/myopathy vs
   exacerbation of post-polio, etc.), which migh be helpful for prognosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), secondary to breast cancer treatment. She presented with fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure, and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxemia and intubated for respiratory failure, later diagnosed as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She had a partial endotracheal tube obstruction, which was confirmed by bronchoscopy, leading to reintubation. Her PEEP will be decreased today. It seems she may have a myopathic or neuropathic component to ongoing respiratory failure. Her previous history includes unknown precipitant, all cultures negative, possible steroid-responsive pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of 2-3. A CT scan shows a left upper lobe cavitating nodule, likely a pneumatocoele. BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms, with the rest pending. Pleural effusions are too small to tap per IP. There is doubt of empyema. She is experiencing anuric acute renal failure (ARF) on hemodialysis (HD) per renal. She will likely need her line changed soon. She continues to be febrile, with no clear etiology; cultures so far negative. Possible causes include drug fever, leukemia-induced, nonresolving ventilator-associated"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**], still on vent, now on PSV, ET
   tube change [**2-16**] because clogged. Rebronched [**2167-2-18**]
   Respiratory Failure: Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequent study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of RF.
   Patient tolaterated weaning on pressure support, however, despite good
   gases, is extremely tachypneic to the 40s.  Patient was bronched
   [**2167-2-16**] during rounds, mucous pluggig in ET tube, and ET tube was
   changed. [**2167-2-18**] rebronched, more copious mucous plugging in ET tube.
   Also likely myopathic component at this point.
   - Patient stable currently on PS 50% 10/10.  gas stable on this
   (7.39/39/100/24), will decrease PEEP to 8.
   - daily CXR and frequent suctioning
   - ativan for anxiety, prn morphine
   - continue Voriconazole for cavitary lesion, will d/c pending CT
   tomorrow
   - continue to work towards extubation
   - Family meeting [**2-17**] -> patient will be trached and pegged.
   - Interventional Pulmonolgy consulted, they will evaluate her
   Fever of Unknown Origin: unclear if this is due to infection vs drug
   fever vs AML related.  Sputum grew yeast as did urine, but patient on
   voriconazole. CT showed cavitating lesion left upper lobe, fungus vs
   pneumatocoele
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern5) 1739**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 430**] ([**2-12**]) for suspicion of drug fever,  d/c vanc ([**2-13**]), d/c
   levofloxacin ([**2-17**])
   - f/u cultures
 negative to date
   - CT of chest shows cavitary lesion unlikely infectious will repeat
   Chest CT [**2-19**]
   - cont voriconizole PO, if repeat lung CT not suggestive of infecious
   process, will D/c.
   - ID consult appreciated: will discuss possibilty bone marrow box for
   work up of FUO
   - Will culture all lines when spikes, Consider resetting all lines.
   - consider actinomyces or nocardia given cavitary lesion on CT
   AML:  Day 40 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - per BMT, prognosis poor, on order of months, will not be able to give
   further treatment while intubated
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   - BMT recs appreceated: will hold off on bone marrow bx for now as
   counts are improving and no blasts on diff.
   ARF: Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent with
   ATN.  Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on resolution.
   Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt became oliguric
   and concern that patient with worsened volume overload compromising
   ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been getting
   dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and fluid
   overload.  Pt now oligure/anuric requiring dialysis.  Uncertain if ever
   will regain ability to make urine.
   - continue HD for now,  due today [**2-18**]
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders
   - Should get HD tunnelled line later this week.
   Afib: started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely due
   to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now
   well controlled in sinus on po meds.
   - continue diltiazem
   Anemia: has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, Patient
   transfused 1 unit [**2-17**]
   - transfusion goal to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   Mental Status changes:  MS changes noted on day prior to intubation. CT
   Head neg, however, M4 AML is known for CNS spread that may not be
   appreciable on CT.  Hypoxia & polypharmacy most likely etiology of MS
   changes prior to intubation & unable to properly assess MS [**First Name (Titles) 1646**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 1647**]ted.
   - better evaluate when pt extubated
   Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis:  RESOLVED. pt had
   respiratory alkalosis [**12-27**] hyperventilation with RR>30.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, polio, and newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following induction chemotherapy. She was transferred to the ICU due to febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated since then and underwent bronchoscopy on January 27th. She developed persistent fevers, and her respiratory failure was attributed to volume overload in the setting of ARDS. She tolerated weaning on pressure support but became extremely tachypneic in the 40s. The patient had mucous plugging in the endotracheal tube, which required tube change on February 16th and rebronchoscopy on February 18th. There is also a possibility of a myopathic component. 

Fever of Unknown Origin:
The patient's fever is unclear whether it is due to infection, drug fever, or AML-related. Sputum grew yeast as did urine, but the patient is currently on voriconazole. A CT scan showed a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe, and the possibility of fungus versus pneumatocoele is being considered. 

AML:
The patient underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3 and is now on day 40. Her counts are recovering, and she is no longer neutropenic. However, her prognosis is poor, with only"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. F with PMHx of Breast CA, polio & newly dx secondary AML s/p
   induction with 7+3.  Post induction course complicated by febrile
   neutropenia, worsening hypoxia & ARDS. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**],
   intubated & s/p Bronchoscopy on [**2167-1-27**], still on vent, now on PSV, ET
   tube change [**2-16**] because clogged.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient developed ARDS following induction
   chemotherapy and has been intubatd since
.  Etiology not particulary
   clear.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent in the setting of
   developing persistent fevers.  Repeat CT scan showed cavitary lesion,
   but on subsequt study seems more consistet w/ penumatocele.  Some
   difficulty of ween attributed to volume overload in setting of ARF.
   Patient tolaterated weaning on pressure support, however, despite good
   gases, is extremely tachypneic to the 40s.  Patient was bronched
   [**2167-2-16**] during rounds, mucous pluggig in ET tube, and ET tube was
   changed.
   - [**2-18**] decrease PSV settings to [**9-2**] (from 15/10) ABG on this
   7.46/33/102/24, pCO2 inproving. PO2 appropriate
   - daily CXR and frequent suctioning
   - ativan for anxiety
   - will add prn morphine
   - continue Voriconazole for cavitary lesion
   - continue to work towards extubation
   - pt approacing critical juncture where decision may need to be made
   about trach and peg, will try very hard to extubate patient, as
   longterm prognosis from heme-onc standpoint very poor
   -
   Fever of Unknown Origen: unclear if this is due to infection vs drug
   fever vs AML related.   Sputum Yeast in urine Cx, but patient on
   voriconazole, will d/c foley.  CT showed cavitating lesion left upper
   lobe, fungus vs pneumatocoele
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern5) 1739**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 430**] ([**2-12**]) for suspicion of drug fever,  d/c vanc ([**2-13**]), d/c
   levofloxacin [**2-17**]
   -f/u cultures
 negative to date
   - CT of chest shows cavitary lesion unlikely infectious
   - cont voriconizole PO
   - ID consult appreciated: will discuss possibilty bone marrow box for
   work up of FUO
   - Per ID will repeat Chest CT [**2-19**]
   - Will culture all lines when spikes.
   - per ID consider changing lines
   - consider Abd CT for abscess or other etiology of fever
   - consider actinomyces or nocardia given cavitary lesion on CT
   AML:  Day 40 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - er BMT, prognosis poor, on order of months, will not be able to give
   further treatment while intubated
   -  transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   -  monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   -  BMT recs appreceated: will hold off on bone marrow bx for now as
   counts are improving and no blasts on diff.
   ARF: Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent with
   ATN.  Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on resolution.
   Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt became oliguric
   and concern that patient with worsened volume overload compromising
   ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been getting
   dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and fluid
   overload.  Pt now oligure/anuric requiring dialysis.  Uncertain if ever
   will regain ability to make urine.
   - continue HD for now, due [**2-18**]
   - appreciate renal rec
   - cont phos binders
   - Patient will need HD line changed soon, consider placing tunnelled
   line, but high risk given fever of [**Last Name (un) 1780**] origin.
   Afib: started [**2-2**] following insertion of the HD catheter, likely due
   to atrial irritation.  HR was temporary controlled on dilt gtt, now
   well controlled in sinus on po meds.
   - continue diltiazem
   Anemia: has been transfusion dependant s/p induction, Patient
   transfused 1 unit [**2-17**]
   - transfusion goal to maintain hct >25
   - stool guaiac negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   Mental Status changes:  MS changes noted on day prior to intubation. CT
   Head neg, however, M4 AML is known for CNS spread that may not be
   appreciable on CT.  Hypoxia & polypharmacy most likely etiology of MS
   changes prior to intubation & unable to properly assess MS [**First Name (Titles) 1646**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 1647**]ted.
   - better evaluate when pt extubated
   Mixed Metabolic Alkalosis/Respiratory Alkalosis:  RESOLVED. pt had
   respiratory alkalosis [**12-27**] hyperventilation with RR>30.

Post-induction, the patient developed febrile neutropenia, worsening hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, with an unclear etiology. The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator due to persistent fevers and volume overload in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) but remained extremely tachypneic. The endotracheal (ET) tube was changed due to mucous plugging.

The patient has a cavitary lesion on the left upper lobe of the lung, which is concerning for fungal infection versus pneumatocoele. The source of fever remains unclear, with possible causes including infection, drug fever, or AML-related factors. The patient is currently on voriconazole and has negative sputum and urine cultures to date.

The patient's AML counts are recovering, and they are no longer neutropenic. However, the patient's renal function has deteriorated, with rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts in the urine sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient became olig"

   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology [**12-27**] ARDS s/p induction chemotherapy,
   volume overload, PNA, mucus plugging, myopathy.
   - [**2-18**] bronchoscopy: Copious thick purulent secretions througout ET
   tube, lung, airways with no evidence of mucus plugging
   - Tolerating PS [**9-2**], FiO2 50%, gas 7.43/35/91/24.
   - Supportive care/monitoring: Daily CXR, suctioning
   - ativan for anxiety, prn morphine
   - continue Voriconazole for cavitary lesion, will d/c pending CT
   tomorrow
   - continue to work towards extubation
   - Family meeting [**2-17**] -> patient will be trached and pegged.
   - Interventional Pulmonolgy consulted, they will evaluate her
   Fever of Unknown Origin: unclear if this is due to infection vs drug
   fever vs AML related.  Sputum grew yeast as did urine, but patient on
   voriconazole. CT showed cavitating lesion left upper lobe, fungus vs
   pneumatocoele

   - consider actinomyces or nocardia given cavitary lesion on CT
   AML:  Day 40 s/p induction with 7+3. Counts recovering, no longer
   neutropenic
   - per BMT, prognosis poor, on order of months, will not be able to give
   further treatment while [**Month/Year (2) 1657**]
   - transfusion scales: transfuse if Hct<25 or plt<10
   - monitor daily ANCs , avoiding G-CSF.
   - BMT recs appreceated: will hold off on bone marrow bx for now as
   counts are improving and no blasts on diff.
   ARF: Rising Creatine & muddy brown casts in sediment consistent with
   ATN.  Creatinine plateau not defined yet, still waiting on resolution.
   Creatinine continues to rise after each HD session. Pt became oliguric
   and concern that patient with worsened volume overload compromising
   ability to extubate, HD catheter placed and pt has been getting
   dialyzed for supratherapeutic Vanc levels (now resolved) and fluid
   overload.  Pt now oligure/anuric requiring dialysis.  Uncertain if ever
   will regain ability to make urine.
   - continue HD for now,  due today [**2-18**]
   - appreciate renal rec

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, CMV viremia, VRE bacteremia, renal failure, tracheostomy, and PEG placement. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, high heart rate, and low blood pressure. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and sedatives. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PPS mode and has stable oxygenation but requires assistance for breathing. She has been receiving dialysis and is being closely monitored for fluid balance. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with low platelet count. Her electrolytes and kidney function are also abnormal.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. Given her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay, she is at risk for developing new infections or experiencing complications from existing ones.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient's high heart rate (tachycardia) and low blood pressure (hypotension) may indicate potential cardiac problems such as sepsis, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.
3. Respiratory issues: Although the patient's oxygenation is stable, her need for mechanical ventilation indicates significant respiratory compromise. She may be at risk for further respiratory deterioration or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3. The patient's post-induction course was complicated by multifactorial hypoxia, fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was intubated on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and had an endotracheal (ET) tube change due to clogging. She also underwent two bronchoscopies.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C (102.8°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/74 mmHg to 101/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 50%. The patient is on CPAP/PPS mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume (Vt) of 464 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 100. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values show pH 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 35 mmHg,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She was admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia, intubated for respiratory failure, and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with improving ARDS, fevers, volume overload, acute renal failure (ARF), and anemia. She is expected to undergo tracheostomy today and may face difficulties with weaning due to weakness. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate levels. Imaging reveals increased sinus opacification and lung infiltrates consistent with ARDS. Microbiology tests have been negative so far.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fevers and lung infiltrates indicate a possible ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Complications can include hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's anuric ARF requires hemodialysis and poses a risk of electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Anemia: The patient's stable"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3. She presented with fever, hypoxia, and respiratory failure, which was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA), volume overload, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She was intubated on day 21 and has since undergone two bronchoscopies.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The etiology of the respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including ARDS secondary to induction chemotherapy, volume overload, possible infection, pneumonitis, mucus plugging, and myopathy. Voriconazole was discontinued due to a non-infectious lesion in the left upper lobe, likely a pneumatocoele. The patient's ventilator settings were adjusted to pressure support ventilation (PSV) 10/8, and she showed improvement.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The etiology of the fever is still unknown and could be due to infection, drug fever, or AML. The patient's sinus opacification on CT scan suggests an infectious cause, possibly invasive fungal infection. Antibiotics were stopped and an ENT swab was taken from the sinuses. The patient is also being evaluated for other sources of infection, such as lines.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient's"

   68-year-old woman with h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syndrome,
   recently dx
d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with
   a complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred to ICU for ARDS.  She underwent T/G on
   [**2167-2-19**].
   Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: day 22 intubation.
   It appears as if she may have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic
   component to ongoing respiratory failure.
   She also has continuing significant pulmonary parenchymal disease
   likely recovering ARDS
   Assess RSBI today; suspect that we will need to slowly wean her
   ventilatory support.
   Prev hx (per notes): unknown precipitant,all cultures negative,
   possible steroid responsive pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of
   [**2-3**].  CT shows LUL cavitating nodule which is likely pneumatocoele.
   BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms, rest pending.  Pleural effusions,
   too small to tap per IP. Doubt empyema.
   Anuric ARF: on HD per renal
   If she continues to be afebrile, move to tunneled line.
   Fevers
          Her fever curve finally appears to be trending down, now off
   all antibiotics.  ?voriconazole drug fever.
          We will continue to follow all cultures
          If she demonstrates further evidence of infection (fever,
   increase in WBC, etc.), I would favor re-bronch with Bal directed
   toward her more nodular CT areas.
   Anemia:
   Slow trend down.  Transfuse to keep > 21.
   AML
   BMT following.  No evidence of active disease, although exceedingly
   high likelihood for relapse.
   Weakness
   On exam, this is most consistent with a peripheral neuropathy.  Suspect
   that this is related to critical illness, but the differential
   diagnosis is complicated by her history of post-polio syndrome.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and gastrostomy. The patient has been experiencing fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute renal failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure with improving ARDS, day 22 intubation.
2. Significant pulmonary parenchymal disease likely recovering ARDS.
3. Assess RSBI today; suspect that we will need to slowly wean her ventilatory support.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care. They have undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and G-tube placement. Fever may be decreasing, and they tolerated the procedures well. The patient is unable to provide history due to the tracheostomy. They have allergies to oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and have received antibiotics (Voriconazole and Cefazolin) recently. They are on multiple infusions including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and lansoprazole. Other medications include PPI, SQI, epo, ativan TID, SQH, Afrin, and diltiazem 120 held.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for flowsheet data as of 2/20/2167. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/82 to 171/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 78.7 kg, and their height is 59 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 797 mL and output of 60 mL. Respiratory support is provided through CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 25, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 81.

Physical examination reveals general appearance as thin, eyes/conjunctiva as PERRL, cardiovascular system with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, peripheral vascular system with present radial and dorsal pulses, respiratory/chest with clear breath sounds and crackles, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, unable to stand due to musculoskeletal issues, warm skin, and neurologic examination showing attentive and purposeful movement with decreased tone.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 309 K/uL, sodium of 136 mg/dL, potassium of 4.2 K/uL, glucose of 99 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal ranges. Imaging shows acceptable tracheostomy and bilateral infiltrates that are probably stable. Microbiology is negative for any new positive microorganisms.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition with a pulmonary diet, glycemic control, lines including arterial and PICC lines, dialysis catheter, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU. Total time spent with the patient is noted as critically ill."

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old woman with h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syndrome,
   recently dx
d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with
   a complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred to ICU for ARDS.  She underwent T/G on
   [**2167-2-19**].
   Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: day 22 intubation.
   It appears as if she may have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic
   component to ongoing respiratory failure.
   She also has continuing significant pulmonary parenchymal disease
   likely recovering ARDS
   Assess RSBI today; suspect that we will need to slowly wean her
   ventilatory support.
   Prev hx (per notes): unknown precipitant,all cultures negative,
   possible steroid responsive pneumonitis initially, off steroids as of
   [**2-3**].  CT shows LUL cavitating nodule which is likely pneumatocoele.
   BAL showed 1+ polys, no organisms, rest pending.  Pleural effusions,
   too small to tap per IP. Doubt empyema.
   Anuric ARF: on HD per renal
   If she continues to be afebrile, move to tunneled line.
   Fevers
          Her fever curve finally appears to be trending down, now off
   all antibiotics.  ?voriconazole drug fever.
          We will continue to follow all cultures
          If she demonstrates further evidence of infection (fever,
   increase in WBC, etc.), I would favor re-bronch with Bal directed
   toward her more nodular CT areas.
   Anemia:
   Slow trend down.  Transfuse to keep > 21.
   AML
   BMT following.  No evidence of active disease, although exceedingly
   high likelihood for relapse.
   Weakness
   On exam, this is most consistent with a peripheral neuropathy.  Suspect
   that this is related to critical illness, but the differential
   diagnosis is complicated by her history of post-polio syndrome.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has been experiencing fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement on [**2167-2-19**]. Her fever curve is now trending down, and she is off all antibiotics. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 350 mL, RR set at 25, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and RSBI of 81.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient had fevers initially, and there is a possibility of ongoing or recurrent infection due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay. Further evaluation with cultures and bronchoscopy with BAL may be necessary.
2. ARDS/Respiratory Failure: The patient has progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and extensive infection workup unrevealing, suggesting possible ARDS. Weaning off ventilatory support may be challenging due to substantial myopathic or neuropathic component to ongoing respiratory failure.
3. Anemia: The patient has a slow trend down in hemoglobin levels, indicating anemia. Regular monitoring and transfusion to keep hemoglobin"

   5:30pm
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1395**] developed tachycardia to the 180s. This was accompanied by
   hypotension to the low 80s. The rhythm was a regular, narrow complex
   tachycardia.  We successfully cardioverted her with carotid massage.
   Examination of the termination strip is not completely diagnostic, but
   overall suspect that this represents an AVNRT.  ATach is also in DDx.
   Doubt Aflutter given the rate.  Her diltiazem was held until she
   completed hemodialysis, and this may contribute.  We will check
   electrolytes and check a CXR to assess line position.  If line is in
   atrium and tachycardias persist, may need to consider pulling it back a
   few centimeters or replacing.  Issues explained to husband and
   daughter, who were in room

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She has been admitted to the ICU for ARDS and underwent a tracheostomy on [**2167-2-19**]. She continues to experience respiratory failure with improving ARDS, and there may be a substantial myopathic or neuropathic component to her ongoing respiratory failure. She also has significant pulmonary parenchymal disease likely recovering from ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever curve is improving, but she has had fevers in the past. If she demonstrates further evidence of infection (fever, increase in WBC, etc.), a bronchoscopy with BAL directed toward her more nodular CT areas may be necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is trending down, and she should be transfused to keep her hemoglobin level above 21.
3. AML: Although there is no evidence of active disease, the high likelihood for relapse should be considered, and a bone marrow transplant may be a future consideration.
4. Weakness: The patient's weakness is most consistent with a peripheral neuropathy, which could be related to critical illness or her history of post-polio syndrome.
5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient developed tachycardia to the 180"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy. She presented with hypoxia and was intubated on day 21. She has been experiencing various complications including respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, weakness, mental status changes, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and AML.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. There is a potential complication of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has been experiencing fever despite negative cultures. This could indicate a drug fever, infection, or a complication of AML. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Weakness: The patient exhibits upper extremity weakness more than lower extremity weakness and is areflexic. This could be due to ICU myopathy or demyelination, deconditioning, or post-polio syndrome. A neurology consult is recommended.
4. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status has improved, but she had previous polypharmacy. Monitoring postextubation and addressing any potential medication-related causes is necessary.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has stable renal failure and is on hemodialysis (HD). The prognosis is uncertain. Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting treatment"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. The patient's main medical issues include respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, weakness, mental status changes, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and AML.

Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on day 21 due to hypoxia and ARDS. She is now on partial support ventilation (PSV) and is improving, with plans to continue weaning her off mechanical ventilation.

Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has had a persistent fever, making it difficult to determine the source of infection. All cultures have been negative, and there is a concern for drug fever or infection-related complications such as invasive fungal infection.

Weakness: The patient is experiencing upper extremity weakness, which is likely due to ICU myopathy, demyelination, deconditioning, or post-breast cancer syndrome.

Mental Status Changes: The patient had mental status changes but has shown improvement.

Renal Failure: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) with stable renal function, but the prognosis is uncertain.

Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has stable atrial fibrillation, controlled with diltiazem PO.

AML: The patient is on day 41 of induction chemotherapy with 7+3. Her white blood cell count is normal, and she is not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. She has been intubated since day 21 and is now on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's respiratory status has slowly improved, but she continues to require ventilatory support. She also has a tracheostomy and is being weaned from the ventilator. The patient's medical history includes post-induction febrile neutropenia, hypoxia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, and bacteremia from gram-positive cocci. She is currently being treated with vancomycin and has had all her lines reset. The patient's fever of unknown origin has been afebrile for several weeks, but she still has not been definitively diagnosed. Her renal function is stable with ongoing oliguric/anuric status on hemodialysis (HD). She also has upper extremity weakness, which is likely due to ICU myopathy or demyelination, deconditioning, or post-syndrome. Mental status changes have improved, and she is now alert and awake. She is responding well to vocal commands and is being monitored postextubation. Her AML treatment has been put on hold while she is intubated. The patient is on a nutrition support with a pulmonary formula and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy on February 19th.

The patient's condition has been complicated by fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute renal failure, and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Despite extensive infection workup, no specific cause has been identified. She has been on mechanical ventilation since day 23 of intubation.

Her current vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/59 to 168/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 50% FiO2. She is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with set tidal volume of 410 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 326 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 58 to 146 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests with aspartate aminotransferase ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has been experiencing fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She was intubated on day 23 due to ARDS and underwent a tracheostomy (T/G) on 02/19. She continues to have significant pulmonary parenchymal disease likely recovering from ARDS and may have a myopathic or neuropathic component to ongoing respiratory failure. Her fever curve is trending down, and she is off all antibiotics. Blood cultures show positive results for gram-positive organisms. She is anuric with acute renal failure and requires hemodialysis (HD). There is no evidence of active AML disease, but there is a high likelihood for relapse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has had ongoing fevers and positive blood cultures, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been experiencing ARDS, characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status are crucial.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury. Hemodialysis is being performed to"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient had a supraventricular tachycardia episode, which responded to carotid massage and was treated with intravenous diltiazem. The patient also experienced transient hypotension requiring transient pressor support. The patient's arterial line was replaced on February 19th, and blood cultures of the old arterial line were drawn. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation.

The patient has a history of allergies to oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and a last dose of antibiotics (cefazolin) on February 19th at 4:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving several ICU medications, including diltiazem and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 117 bpm (with a range of 101-170 bpm), blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg (with a range of 77-168/50-113 mmHg), respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (with a range of 14-31 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%.

d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with
   a complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred to ICU for ARDS.  She underwent T/G on
   [**2167-2-19**].
   Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: day 23 intubation.
   It appears as if she may have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic
   component to ongoing respiratory failure.
   She also has continuing significant pulmonary parenchymal disease
   likely recovering ARDS
   Will need to slowly wean her ventilatory support. On PSV 12/8, 50% FIO2
 will try [**9-2**] today and follow exam. Follow NIFs.
   Anuric ARF: on HD per renal. Now with + blood cx, discuss with Renal
   whether we can pull line give 48 hrs and then resite on Monday for next
   HD.
   Fevers: new GPC off old Aline culture
          Rx Vanco, needs surveillance cultures, pull HD catheter and
   PICC
   Anemia:
   Slow trend down.  Transfuse to keep > 21.
   AML
   BMT following.  No evidence of active disease, although exceedingly
   high likelihood for relapse.
   Weakness
   On exam, this is most consistent with a peripheral neuropathy.  Suspect
   that this is related to critical illness, but the differential
   diagnosis is complicated by her history of post-polio syndrome.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now experiencing respiratory failure. She has been intubated for 23 days and is being treated in the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition includes fevers, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, anuria with acute renal failure (ARF), and positive blood cultures. She has been receiving hemodialysis (HD) per renal failure. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged intubation and ARDS increase the risk of further respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Infection: The presence of fevers, positive blood cultures, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggest a potential ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels indicate possible AKI, which may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed appropriately.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's weakness and peripheral neurop"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has been admitted to the ICU. She underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3 and developed post-induction febrile neutropenia, hypoxia, ARDS, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, and bacteremia from gram-positive cocci. The patient was intubated on day 21 and had two bronchoscopies. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has slowly improving respiratory status. The most likely etiologies affecting her respiratory status are volume from renal failure, polio myopathy, mucus plugging, and deconditioning.

The patient has been febrile for several weeks, and the etiology of the fever is still unknown. She has had various antibiotics given, but all cultures prior to 2/19 have been negative. It is unclear whether the fever is due to infection, drug fever, or AML. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is responding well to vocal commands.

The patient has renal failure since 12/27 and is on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. Her renal function remains stable, but her prognosis is uncertain. She is anemic and transfusion-dependent due to AML induction. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, and she is not neutropenic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. She underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3 and developed post-induction febrile neutropenia, hypoxia, ARDS, LUL PNA, volume overload, and B pulmonary infiltrates. She was intubated on day 21 and has been on mechanical ventilation since then. She has a central venous catheter, tracheostomy, and arterial line. She has been diagnosed with gram-positive cocci bacteremia from blood cultures taken on 2/19. Her respiratory status is slowly improving, and she is being weaned from the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of gram-positive cocci bacteremia, and there is a possibility of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of ARDS, which may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ATN and is on hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function.
4. Myopathy/ICU Demyelination: The patient has weakness in the upper and lower extremities, which could be due to ICU myopathy or demyelination.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient had mental status changes"

d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with
   a complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred to ICU for ARDS.  She underwent T/G on
   [**2167-2-19**].
   Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: day 23 intubation.
   It appears as if she may have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic
   component to ongoing respiratory failure.
   She also has continuing significant pulmonary parenchymal disease
   likely recovering ARDS
   Will need to slowly wean her ventilatory support. On PSV 12/8, 50% FIO2
 will try [**9-2**] today and follow exam. Follow NIFs.

   On exam, this is most consistent with a peripheral neuropathy.  Suspect

The patient's respiratory failure appears to have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic component, and she also has significant pulmonary parenchymal disease likely recovering from ARDS. She needs to be slowly weaned from ventilatory support.

The patient also has anuric acute renal failure (ARF) on hemodialysis (HD) per renal, with positive blood culture and line-associated infection. She will have her line replaced with an implantable reservoir (IR) and continue HD tomorrow. She has ongoing fevers with a new gram-positive cocci (GPC) infection, and old Aline culture needs to be pulled. She requires surveillance cultures, and the HD catheter and PICC line need to be removed. An echocardiogram (Echo) will be performed in the morning.

The patient has a slow trend down in hemoglobin levels and requires transfusion to maintain a level"

d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with
   a complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred to ICU for ARDS.  She underwent T/G on
   [**2167-2-19**].
   Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: day 23 intubation.
   It appears as if she may have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic
   component to ongoing respiratory failure.
   She also has continuing significant pulmonary parenchymal disease
   likely recovering ARDS
   Will need to slowly wean her ventilatory support. On PSV 12/8, 50% FIO2
 will try [**9-2**] today and follow exam. Follow NIFs.
   Anuric ARF: on HD per renal. Now with + blood cx, pulled line, will
   replace tomm with IR. Next HD tommorow
   Fevers: new GPC off old Aline culture
          Rx Vanco, needs surveillance cultures, pull HD catheter and
   PICC
          Echo in AM
   Anemia:
   Slow trend down.  Transfuse to keep > 21.
   AML
   BMT following.  No evidence of active disease, although exceedingly
   high likelihood for relapse.
   Weakness
   On exam, this is most consistent with a peripheral neuropathy.  Suspect
   that this is related to critical illness, but the differential
   diagnosis is complicated by her history of post-polio syndrome.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She has been experiencing fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. She has been intubated for 23 days and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with improving ARDS, anuric ARF (acute renal failure) on hemodialysis per renal, positive blood culture, and fevers. She has also been diagnosed with anemia, weakness consistent with peripheral neuropathy, and a high likelihood of relapse in her AML.

The plan of care includes weaning off ventilatory support, monitoring for myopathic or neuropathic components to ongoing respiratory failure, and continuing treatment for ARDS. The patient will also receive hemodialysis for renal failure, replacement of the intravenous (IV) line, and surveillance cultures. An echocardiogram has been ordered in the morning, and a bone marrow transplant (BMT) is planned following the completion of AML treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to positive blood culture, further deterioration of renal function, and possible relapse of AML.

   Assessment and Plan
   68F h/o breast CA, polio & secondary AML s/p induction (7+3), course
   complicated by post-induction febrile neutropenia, hypoxia [**12-27**] ARDS,
   LUL PNA, volume overload, B pulmonary infiltrates. Intubated day 21
   ([**2167-1-27**]) & s/p bronchoscopy x2 ([**2167-1-27**], 326/08), now on PSV 12/8, now
   with gram positive cocci bacteremia from [**2-19**] blood culture
   Respiratory Failure: Prior etiology likely multifactorial [**12-27**] ARDS s/p
   induction chemotherapy, volume overload,?infection although cxs
   negative (until blood cx [**2-19**]), pneumonitis, mucus plugging, myopathy.
   Now w/ slowly improving respiratory status, s/p tracheostomy [**2167-2-19**].
   Most likely etiologies that are at this point affecting her respiratory
   status are volume from renal failure, polio mypathy, mucous plugging
   and deconditioning.
   - cont to wean from the ventilator, slowly given poor NIFs.
   - @ PS, 12/8
 [**9-2**] and check volumes
   - Supportive care/monitoring: Daily CXR, suctioning
   - HD today
   ID:
   *Gram Positive Cocci Bacteremia:  from [**2-19**] blood cultures, fever spike
   102.7 midnight [**2-19**]
   Likely from art line, as + bl cx from a-line.
   - continue vancomycin, got one dose 3/29 AM, now dose at HD.  Day 3 /
   14.
   - ECHO to rule out valvular vegetations
   - HD catheter pulled [**2167-2-21**]. 2 peripheral IVs placed and PICC pulled
   as well. Now all lines are new. Arterial Line changed [**2-20**].  Now all
   lines completely reset.
   New HD catheter today
   *Fever of Unknown Origin
   Unclear if current fevers are from background FUO (with now adequately
   treated bacteremia) or from recent bacteremia.
   Can consider DVT workup next
   Abx history: D/c
d meropenem ([**2-12**]) for ?drug fever,  d/c
d vanc
   ([**2-13**]), restarted [**2-21**], d/c
d levofloxacin ([**2-17**])
   - All lines reset between [**Date range (1) 1878**].  (HD cath replace today, art line
   replaced, PICC removed)
   - Will repeat Chest Ct this week week to follow progression of lung
   infiltrates, concern for invasive fungal infection
   - Restarted vancomycin [**2167-2-21**] for gram positive cocci bacteremia
   - ENT swabbed sinuses culture, will f/u; hold abx until gram
   stain/culture positive; Afrin spray TID x3 days
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomannan, cryptococcal antigen negative
   AVNRT:
   Previously  patient developed HR of 180s last night, resolved with
   diltiazem, although she became hypotensive on this and required
   pressors for approx 1 hours. Possibly related to picc in atrium, but
   was discontinuted today, so will follow. Initially, new onset [**2-2**] s/p
   HD catheter insertion likely [**12-27**] atrial irritation, controlled on
   diltiazem PO
   - continue diltiazem 90mg TID PO
   Weakness
   Upper >> lower extremity weakness.  Areflexic.  Likely ICU myopathy /
   ICU demyelination, + deconditioning, vs post polio syndrome.
   - neuro consult appreciated: will order MRI of brain, c-spine, EMG/NCS
   and consider spinal tap for CSF analysis if does not improve
   - PT consult
   Renal Failure [**12-27**] ATN on HD: STABLE.  Oliguric/anuric on HD, uncertain
   prognosis. s/p HD [**2-20**], next due [**2-23**]
   - will get new HD temp line on Monday prior to HD, will consider
   changing to tunneled over line once afebrile and stable.
   - renal recs appreciated
   - will d/c foley today
   Mental status changes:  IMPROVED
   Responding to vocal commands well, awake alert.
   AML:  STABLE.  Day 42 s/p induction with 7+3, WBC 4.4, not neutropenic
   - BMT rec: Hold further treatment while intubated, hold bone marrow bx
   (improving counts, no blasts)
   - Transfuse plt<10; monitor ANC, avoid GCSF
   - Anemia: STABLE.  Transfusion dependent s/p induction, guaiac
   negative, hemolysis negative.
   - anemic today, hct of 21.2. will transfuse 1 unit today w/ HD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently intubated in the ICU. She has been experiencing hypoxia and respiratory failure, which has been attributed to ARDS, volume overload, possible infection, pneumonitis, mucus plugging, and myopathy. The patient's recent labs indicate gram-positive cocci bacteremia, and she has been on vancomycin therapy. She also has renal failure, oliguric/anuric on HD, and is dependent on dialysis. The patient's mental status has improved, but she still has weakness and is areflexic. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
3. Stress ulcer
4. ICU myopathy or demyelination
5. Invasive fungal infection
6. Drug fever
7. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI)
8. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)
9. Neurological complications such as seizures or stroke
10. Pressure ulcers or bedsores

   Assessment and Plan
   68F h/o breast CA, polio & secondary AML s/p induction (7+3), course
   complicated by post-induction febrile neutropenia, hypoxia [**12-27**] ARDS,
   LUL PNA, volume overload, B pulmonary infiltrates. Intubated day 21
   ([**2167-1-27**]) & s/p bronchoscopy x2 ([**2167-1-27**], 326/08), now on PSV 12/8, now
   with gram positive cocci bacteremia from [**2-19**] blood culture
   Respiratory Failure: Prior etiology likely multifactorial [**12-27**] ARDS s/p
   induction chemotherapy, volume overload,?infection although cxs
   negative (until blood cx [**2-19**]), pneumonitis, mucus plugging, myopathy.
   Now w/ slowly improving respiratory status. s/p tracheostomy [**2167-2-19**]
   Most likely etiologies that are at this point effecting her respiratory
   status are volume from renal failure, polio mypathy, mucous plugging
   and deconditioning.
   - cont to wean from the ventilator, slowly given poor NIFs.
   - Supportive care/monitoring: Daily CXR, suctioning
   - HD last [**2-20**], next [**2-23**].
   ID:
   *Gram Positive Cocci Bacteremia:  from [**2-19**] blood cultures, fever spike
   102.7 midnight [**2-19**]
   - continue vancomycin, got one dose 3/29 AM, now dose at HD.  Day 2
   - ECHO to rule out valvular vegetations
   - HD catheter pulled [**Last Name (un) 1330**] [**2167-2-21**]. 2 peripheral IVs placed and PICC
   pulled as well. Now all lines are new. Arterial Line changed [**2-20**].  Now
   all lines completely reset. Will need new HD catheter on Monday.
   *Fever of Unknown Origin: has been febrile for severaly weeks. Unclear
   etiology, considering infection vs drug fever vs AML.
    All cultures prior to [**2-19**] have been negative, so etiology of original
   FUO was, most likely related to AML or drug fever.
   Fever curve potentially improving.  Abx history: D/c
d meropenem ([**2-12**])
   for ?drug fever,  d/c
d vanc ([**2-13**]), d/c
d levofloxacin ([**2-17**])
   - All lines reset between [**Date range (1) 1878**].  (HD cath [**Last Name (LF) 1879**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] line replaced,
   PICC removed)
   - Will repeat Chest Ct next week to follow progression of lung
   infiltrates, concern for invasive fungal infection
   - Restarted vancomycin [**2167-2-21**] for gram positive cocci bacteremia
   - ENT swabbed sinuses culture, will f/u; hold abx until gram
   stain/culture positive; Afrin spray TID x3 days
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomannan, cryptococcal antigen negative
   AVNRT: patient developed HR of 180s last night, resolved with
   diltiazem, although she became hypotensive on this and required
   pressors for approx 1 hours. Possibly related to picc in atrium, but
   was discontinuted today, so will follow. Initially, new onset [**2-2**] s/p
   HD catheter insertion likely [**12-27**] atrial irritation, controlled on
   diltiazem PO
   - continue diltiazem 90mg TID PO
   Weakness
   Upper >> lower extremity weakness.  Areflexic.  Likely ICU myopathy /
   ICU demyelination, + deconditioning, vs post polio syndrome.
   - neuro consult appreciated: will order MRI of brain, EMG/NCS and
   consider spinal tap for CSF analysis if does not improve
   - PT consult
   Renal Failure [**12-27**] ATN on HD: STABLE.  Oliguric/anuric on HD, uncertain
   prognosis. s/p HD [**2-20**], next due [**2-23**]
   - will get new HD temp line on Monday prior to HD, will consider
   changing to tunneled over line once afebrile and stable.
   - renal recs appreciated
   Mental status changes:  IMPROVED
   Responding to vocal commands well, awake alert.
   Cont to monitor postextubation.  Likely was [**12-27**] polypharmacy.
   AML:  STABLE.  Day 41 s/p induction with 7+3, WBC 4.4, not neutropenic
   - BMT rec: Hold further treatment while intubated, hold bone marrow bx
   (improving counts, no blasts)
   - Transfuse plt<10; monitor ANC, avoid GCSF
   - Anemia: STABLE.  Transfusion dependent s/p induction, guaiac
   negative, hemolysis negative.
   - anemic today, hct of 21.2. will repeat stat, and recheck tomorrow,
   transfuse of <21.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently admitted to the ICU. She has been experiencing hypoxia, respiratory failure, renal failure, mental status changes, and weakness. The patient has been febrile for several weeks and has had multiple negative cultures. She has been diagnosed with gram-positive cocci bacteremia and is now on vancomycin. The patient's lines have been reset, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation, anemia, and is currently receiving chemotherapy for AML.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is slowly improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. There are multiple factors contributing to her respiratory failure, including ARDS, volume overload, infection, mucous plugging, and myopathy.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with gram-positive cocci bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis if not treated appropriately. Vancomycin has been started, and the source of infection needs to be identified and treated.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has ongoing renal failure, and her renal function needs to be closely monitored. She is on hemodialysis (HD) and may require a tunneled line for future HD.

4. Mental Status Changes: The patient has had mental status changes, which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxia. The patient has been placed on a ventilator with a goal FiO2 of 50-40% and has a Foley catheter in place to assess urine output. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/73 to 150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 965 mL of fluids, with 197 mL going into the PO compartment, 147 mL into the TF compartment, and 955 mL into the IVF compartment. The patient has had a total output of 10 mL of blood products and 100 mL of urine. 

The patient's respiratory support indicates that they are on CPAP/PSV mode with a spontaneous tidal volume of 413 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 110, and their PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 253.

","The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She presented with fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA), volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Extensive infection workup was unrevealing, and she was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy on [**2167-2-19**]. 

The patient is currently on day 26 of ARDS and appears to have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic component to ongoing respiratory failure. She also has significant pulmonary parenchymal disease likely recovering from ARDS. It is planned to slowly wean her from ventilatory support, starting with pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 12/8, with 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to be tried today. Follow-up examination will be done, and noninvasive ventilation interfaces (NIFs) will be monitored.

The patient is anuric with acute renal failure (ARF), receiving hemodialysis (HD) per renal team orders. The HD catheter will be replaced today. She has been treated with aline GPC for 48 hours, with negative surveillance cultures to date. However, new gram-positive cocci (GPC) off"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She was recently diagnosed with AML secondary to breast cancer treatment. The patient has had a complicated course with fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA), volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy on [2167-2-19]. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure with improving ARDS, likely due to myopathic or neuropathic components. She also has significant pulmonary parenchymal disease likely recovering from ARDS. The plan is to slowly wean her from ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a significant myopathic or neuropathic component. Weaning from ventilatory support should be done slowly.
2. Infection: The patient has had fevers and LUL PNA. There is a need for surveillance cultures and consideration of removing the HD catheter and PICC line due to new GPC off old Aline culture. Monitoring for signs of infection is crucial.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is anuric with ARF"

   68-year-old woman with h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syndrome,
   recently dx
d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with
   a complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred to ICU for ARDS.  She underwent T/G on
   [**2167-2-19**].
   Respiratory failure with improving ARDS: day 26 s/p intubation.
   It appears as if she may have a substantial myopathic or neuropathic
   component to ongoing respiratory failure.
   She also has continuing significant pulmonary parenchymal disease
   likely recovering ARDS
   Will need to slowly wean her ventilatory support. On PSV 12/8, 50% FIO2
 will try [**9-2**] today and follow exam. Follow NIFs.
   Anuric ARF: on HD per renal Treated + Aline GPC x 48 hrs - surveillence
   are neg to date, will replace today with IR and HD today.
   Fevers: new GPC off old Aline culture
          Rx Vanco, needs surveillance cultures, pull HD catheter and
   PICC
          Echo in AM
   Anemia:
   Slow trend down.  Transfuse to keep > 21.
   AML
   BMT following.  No evidence of active disease, although exceedingly
   high likelihood for relapse.
   Weakness
   On exam, this is most consistent with a peripheral neuropathy.  Suspect
   that this is related to critical illness, but the differential
   diagnosis is complicated by her history of post-polio syndrome. Neuro
   consulted. EMG planned. MRI this AM.

She also has anuria with acute renal failure (ARF), requiring hemodialysis (HD) and replacement with intravenous (IR) fluids. The patient has fevers, new gram-positive cocci (GPC) infection, and a need for surveillance cultures. An echocardiogram will be performed in the morning. The patient's anemia is being managed with transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level above 21. She has a history of AML, which is being monitored for potential relapse. Weakness is suspected to be related to peripheral neuropathy, possibly due to critical illness or post-polio syndrome. Neurology consultation has been requested, with plans for electromyography (EMG) and magnetic resonance imaging"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of poor urine output, allergies to oxycodone, and previous antibiotic treatment with vancomycin. The patient is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/70 to 150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support with a respiratory system compliance of 110. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 81 and 109 mg/dL. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's platelet count, total bilirubin, and albumin levels are within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.45. The patient's neurological examination is not fully assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation support.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest a possible infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment may be necessary.
3. Poor Urine Output: The patient's poor urine output needs to be addressed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3 and subsequently developed post-induction febrile neutropenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on day 21 and has had two bronchoscopies. Currently, she has coag-negative staph bacteremia from the PICC line, which is being treated with vancomycin. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure due to volume from renal failure, polio myopathy, mucous plugging, and deconditioning. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is being managed with daily chest X-rays, suctioning, and fluid management per HD schedule. The patient's weakness is likely due to ICU myopathy/demyelination, deconditioning, or post-polio syndrome. Renal failure is present with oliguric/anuric on HD and uncertain prognosis. Anemia is also present, requiring transfusion. The patient's mental status is stable, and she is not neutropenic. The plan is to hold further treatment while intubated and monitor ANC, avoiding G-CSF."

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate (HR) between 98-119 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 107/68 to 173/93 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 17-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 93%. The patient is responsive and alert.

The patient has a history of weakness, particularly in the bilateral upper extremities (BUE) compared to the bilateral lower extremities (BLE), with areflexia. This is likely due to ICU myopathy/demyelination, deconditioning, or post-polio"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3 regimen and subsequently developed febrile neutropenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated on day 21 and had two bronchoscopies performed. She is currently experiencing coag-negative staph bacteremia from the PICC line tip, which is being treated with vancomycin.

The patient's respiratory status is stable with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. She is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 106. Her blood gases show pH 7.48, PaCO2 43, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107-173 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The patient's weight is stable at 76.5 kg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1354 mL and output of 2325 mL, resulting in a negative balance of"

   spike 102.7 midnight [**2-19**].  Likely from art line, as + bl cx from
   a-line.
   - continue vancomycin, got one dose 3/29 AM, now dose at HD.  Day 3 /
   14.
   - ECHO to rule out valvular vegetations
   - HD catheter pulled [**2167-2-21**]. 2 peripheral IVs placed and PICC pulled
   as well. Now all lines are new. Arterial Line changed [**2-20**].  Now all
   lines completely reset.
   New HD catheter today
   *Fever of Unknown Origin
   Unclear if current fevers are from background FUO (with now adequately
   treated bacteremia) or from recent bacteremia.
   Can consider DVT workup next
   Abx history: D/c
d meropenem ([**2-12**]) for ?drug fever,  d/c
d vanc
   ([**2-13**]), restarted [**2-21**], d/c
d levofloxacin ([**2-17**])
   - All lines reset between [**Date range (1) 1878**].  (HD cath replace today, art line
   replaced, PICC removed)
   - Will repeat Chest Ct this week week to follow progression of lung
   infiltrates, concern for invasive fungal infection
   - Restarted vancomycin [**2167-2-21**] for gram positive cocci bacteremia
   - ENT swabbed sinuses culture, will f/u; hold abx until gram
   stain/culture positive; Afrin spray TID x3 days
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomannan, cryptococcal antigen negative
   AVNRT:  Previously  patient developed HR of 180s last night, resolved
   with diltiazem, although she became hypotensive on this and required
   pressors for approx 1 hours. Possibly related to picc in atrium, but
   was discontinuted today, so will follow. Initially, new onset [**2-2**] s/p
   HD catheter insertion likely [**12-27**] atrial irritation, controlled on
   diltiazem PO
   - continue diltiazem 90mg TID PO
   Weakness:  Upper >> lower extremity weakness.  Areflexic.  Likely ICU
   myopathy / ICU demyelination, + deconditioning, vs post polio syndrome.
   - neuro consult appreciated: will order MRI of brain, c-spine, EMG/NCS
   and consider spinal tap for CSF analysis if does not improve
   - PT consult
   Renal Failure [**12-27**] ATN on HD: STABLE.  Oliguric/anuric on HD, uncertain
   prognosis. s/p HD [**2-20**], next due [**2-23**]
   - will get new HD temp line on Monday prior to HD, will consider
   changing to tunneled over line once afebrile and stable.
   - renal recs appreciated
   - will d/c foley today
   Mental status changes:  IMPROVED
   Responding to vocal commands well, awake alert.
   AML:  STABLE.  Day 42 s/p induction with 7+3, WBC 4.4, not neutropenic

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, polio, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. She underwent induction chemotherapy for AML and developed post-induction febrile neutropenia, hypoxia, ARDS, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was intubated on day 21 and has undergone two bronchoscopies. She is now on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode with a pressure of 12 cmH2O and an oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 40%. The patient has gram-positive cocci bacteremia from blood cultures, likely from an arterial line infection. She has also had fevers of unknown origin and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient's respiratory status is slowly improving, and she recently had a tracheostomy. The most likely etiologies affecting her respiratory status include volume from renal failure, polio myopathy, mucus plugging, and deconditioning. Other medical complications include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib), renal failure, mental status changes, anemia, and weakness. The patient's current medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and various other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, and she requires ventilator support"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and various medications to manage his condition. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to have elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. He is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding and has been undergoing dialysis due to renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture results will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is essential.
4. Infection: The patient is at increased risk of infections due to his immunocompromised state and invasive procedures. Regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and cultures is crucial.
5. Renal function deterioration: Continued monitoring of renal function is necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She has had a complicated course with fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Despite extensive infection workup, no definitive source has been identified. She was transferred to the ICU for ARDS and underwent tracheostomy and groin placement on [**2167-2-19**]. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 74, indicating improving ARDS. However, she continues to have significant pulmonary parenchymal disease likely recovering from ARDS and requires slow weaning of ventilatory support.

The patient also has anuric acute renal failure (ARF) and is on hemodialysis (HD) per renal team recommendation. She has a central venous catheter infection (GPC) off old Aline culture, for which she is being treated with Vancomycin. Surveillance cultures are negative to date, and the HD catheter and PICC will be replaced today. An echocardiogram will be performed in the morning.

The patient's anemia is slowly trending down, and she will be transfused to keep her hemoglobin (Hb) level above 21. She has a history of AML, and bone marrow transplant (BMT) has been planned following the completion of treatment. There is no evidence of active disease at present, although the likelihood of relapse is high.

The patient's weakness on examination is most consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which could be related to critical illness or her history of post-polio syndrome. Neurology consultation has been obtained, and an electromyogram (EMG) is planned. An MRI will be performed this morning.

ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 40 mL/hour, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, arterial line placement on [**2167-2-20**] 11:35 PM, 20-gauge central venous catheter placement on [**2167-2-21**] 01:00 PM, and dialysis catheter placement on [**2167-2-23**] 03:23 PM. Prophylactic measures include low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite negative surveillance cultures, the patient's fevers suggest the possibility of ongoing infection, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
3. Renal failure: The patient's anuric ARF may progress, necessitating continued hemodialysis and close monitoring of renal function.
4. Catheter-related infections: The presence of a GPC off old Aline culture indicates a potential catheter-related infection, which needs to be treated promptly.
5. Relapse of AML: Given the patient's history of AML and high likelihood"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She has been experiencing fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA), volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing. The patient was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and underwent tracheostomy (T/G) on [**2167-2-19**].

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to myopathic or neuropathic component to ongoing respiratory failure. She also has significant pulmonary parenchymal disease likely recovering from ARDS. However, there has been some improvement in the past two days. The plan is to place the patient on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and request partial mandatory ventilation (PMV) so she can speak. Short bursts of tracheostomy mask trials are also being considered.

The patient is anuric with acute renal failure (ARF) and is on hemodialysis (HD) with a new line placed on [**2-23**]. She has low-grade fevers and is being treated with vancomycin for Gram-positive cocci (GPC) off aline, surveillance cultures, pulled catheter, and PICC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She is currently in the ICU due to post-induction febrile neutropenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), tracheostomy, and oliguric renal failure. She has been diagnosed with coag-negative staph bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with failed tracheostomy trials and ongoing fluid status issues. She also has weakness in both upper and lower extremities due to ICU myopathy and post-polio syndrome. She has oliguric renal failure and requires hemodialysis (HD). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AVNRT) and is on diltiazem. Her mental status is stable, and she is awake and alert. She is currently on day 42 post-induction with 7+3 chemotherapy for AML. She requires ongoing monitoring and supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to ARDS and fluid status issues. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilator management are crucial to prevent respiratory failure.

2. Coag-negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated for coag-negative staph bacteremia with vancom"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She underwent induction chemotherapy (7+3) and developed post-induction febrile neutropenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on hemodialysis (HD) since December 27th due to ATN-related oliguric renal failure. She currently has a coag-negative staph bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin.

The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, requiring ventilatory support. She had a successful tracheostomy trial today but felt uncomfortable and short of breath. The patient is also experiencing fluid status issues and has been diagnosed with ICU myopathy and generalized axonal polyneuropathy.

Other medical conditions include depression, weakness due to ICU myopathy and post-polio syndrome, renal failure on HD, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), AML in remission, and anemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration in renal function, development of new infections, and potential cardiac complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s/p induction chemo). She was admitted for post-induction febrile neutropenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN)-related oliguric renal failure. The patient has a coag-negative staph bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may be compromised due to her previous ARDS and ongoing fluid status management.
2. Coag-negative staph bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with coag-negative staphylococcus bacteremia. Proper antibiotic therapy and source control measures should be continued to treat the infection effectively.
3. Depression: The patient is experiencing bradykinetic depression, and a pending psych consult is planned. It is important to address the patient's mental health needs.
4. Weakness: The patient's weakness is attributed to ICU myopathy and post-polio syndrome. Physical therapy and regular PT follow-up are recommended.
5. Renal failure: The patient has ATN-related oliguric renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing HD management are necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. The patient has undergone induction chemotherapy for AML and is now experiencing febrile neutropenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and has a coag-negative staph bacteremia that is being treated with vancomycin.

The patient's current medical conditions and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is currently affected by fluid status, post-polio syndrome, and ICU myopathy. The plan is to transition from tracheal mask ventilation to blow-by humidified air and manage fluid balance according to the HD schedule.
2. ID: The patient has coag-negative staph bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin. Follow-up levels will be monitored.
3.?Depression: The patient was less interactive yesterday but is smiling and more outgoing today. A psych consult will be held off for now.
4. Weakness: The patient has weakness in both upper and lower extremities, which is likely due to ICU myopathy and post-polio syndrome. Physical therapy and neurology follow-up"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She was admitted for induction chemotherapy and developed febrile neutropenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and oliguric renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. She also has weakness, depression, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of ARDS and is currently affected by fluid status. There is a need for careful management of her ventilation and fluid balance.
2. Coag-negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient has a bloodstream infection caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. She is currently on vancomycin, but the infection may persist or recur, requiring ongoing monitoring and potential changes in antibiotic therapy.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure due to ATN. She is on HD, but her renal function should be closely monitored for any deterioration.
4. Depression and Weakness: The patient has bradykinetic depression and weakness due to ICU myopathy and post-polio syndrome. A psychological consultation is pending, and she may require further treatment for depression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on a tracheostomy mask with non-invasive ventilation. The patient is unable to provide a history as he is not speaking. The patient has a history of allergies to Oxycodone and experiences nausea/vomiting. The last dose of antibiotics, Vancomycin, was given on 02/23 at 06:33 PM. The patient is receiving various medications including Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, PPI, epo, SQI, SQH, dilt, and vanco at HD.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except where noted above. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/76 mmHg to 167/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has sinus tachycardia and is thin in general appearance.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the respiratory/chest area, soft and non-tender abdomen with an okay PEG site, muscle wasting, and decreased tone. Neurologic examination shows attentiveness with purposeful movement and decreased tone.

Lab results show hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 373 K/uL, sodium of 83 mg/dL,"

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old woman with h/o stage II breast Ca, post-polio syndrome,
   recently dx
d AML (felt secondary to breast cancer treatment), now with
   a complicated course with fevers, LUL PNA, volume overload, ARF and
   progressive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection w/u
   unrevealing, transferred to ICU for ARDS.  She underwent T/G on [**2167-2-19**]
   and has been weaning slowly since.
   Respiratory failure with improving ARDS:
   Tolerated trach collar since yesterday afternoon (!)
   She appears to have a mix of myo/neuropathy and pulmonary parenchymal
   disease that likely represents recovering ARDS.
   Try PMV again today
   Would maintain in critical care setting for another day, since she is
   at higher-than-usual risk of tiring and needing additional mechanical
   ventilation because of her prolonged ventilation and existing weakness
   Anuric ARF: on HD with new line placed [**2-23**]
   Fevers: low grade, likely related to possible PICC line infection with
   CNS.  TTE reassuring.
          Vanco x 14d or as per ID
          Surveillance cultures; if (+)
 TEE
   Anemia:
   Slow trend down.  Transfuse to keep > 21.
   AML
   BMT following.  No evidence of active disease, although exceedingly
   high likelihood for relapse.  Last blasts seen peripherally on [**2-20**],
   but none since.
   Weakness: peripheral neuropathy and myopathy, likely attributable to
   critical illness and post-polio syndrome
   Depression(?):
   Ask psychiatry to consult.  ?role for pharmacologic therapies such as
   Ritalin.
   Begin screening for vent rehab
 potentially ready in next few days.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She has been experiencing fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA), volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing. The patient underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy (T/G) on [**2167-2-19**] and has been weaning slowly since.

The patient's current condition is described as respiratory failure with improving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She tolerates tracheostomy collar since yesterday afternoon and appears to have a mix of myopathy and neuropathy along with pulmonary parenchymal disease, likely representing recovering ARDS. The plan is to try passive mandatory ventilation (PMV) again today.

The patient is also diagnosed with anuric acute renal failure (ARF) and is on hemodialysis (HD) with a new line placed on [**2-23**]. She has low-grade fevers, likely related to possible peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line infection with central nervous system involvement. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) results are reassuring.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a trend down, but transfusions are planned to keep hemoglobin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. The patient underwent induction chemotherapy for AML and developed febrile neutropenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and tracheostomy. She also has oliguric renal failure related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has been diagnosed with coag-negative staph bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, fluid status management, post-polio syndrome with ICU myopathy, weakness in both upper and lower extremities (except for the right arm), depression, anemia, and stable AML with day 42 post-induction.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: Long-term catheter use increases the risk of bloodstream infections.
4. Renal failure: The patient already has oliguric renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. ICU myopathy: The patient's weakness is attributed to post"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has been admitted to the ICU. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and post-polio syndrome with ICU myopathy. The patient also has coag-negative staph bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin. She has oliguric renal failure and is on hemodialysis (HD). Her weakness is attributed to ICU myopathy and post-polio syndrome, and she is scheduled for daily physical therapy (PT) sessions. The patient's anemia is transfusion-dependent and stable. Her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AVNRT) is well-controlled on diltiazem. The patient's AML is in remission after induction treatment with 7+3 chemotherapy regimen, but further treatment is on hold until she recovers from her current condition. She is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, for which she is receiving prophylactic treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure due to ARDS and post-polio syndrome with ICU myopathy.
2. Persistent coag-negative staph bacteremia or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Progressive renal failure requiring adjustment of HD parameters.
4. Prolonged weakness and dependence on ICU myopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. She was admitted with post-induction febrile neutropenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), tracheostomy, and oliguric renal failure. She also has coag-negative staph bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient's recent medical history includes AML induction chemotherapy, tracheostomy, and placement of a dialysis catheter. She is experiencing weakness due to ICU myopathy and post-polio syndrome, but is showing improvement with physical therapy. Other ongoing issues include anemia, atrial fibrillation (AVNRT), and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of ARDS and dependence on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure and is on hemodialysis. There is a potential risk of further deterioration in renal function.
3. Coag-negative staph bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin for coag-negative staph bacteremia. There is a potential risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic resistance.
4. ICU myopathy: The patient's weakness is attributed to ICU myopathy and post-polio syndrome. There is a potential risk of prolonged weakness and functional dependence."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast cancer, post-polio syndrome, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to breast cancer treatment. She has been experiencing fevers, left upper lobe pneumonia (LUL PNA), volume overload, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with extensive infection workup unrevealing.
