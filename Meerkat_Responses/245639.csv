","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), renal artery stenosis (RAS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and holocaust survivor presenting to the emergency department (ED) from home after experiencing large episodes of melena and coffee ground emesis. He was found to have two gastric ulcers, one with a bleeding vessel that was clipped during an endoscopy (EGD). The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) and hematocrit (Hb) levels have continued to fall, and platelet count (Plt) has dropped below 50. Both were actively transfused.

The patient also presented with chest pain upon arrival, likely related to known angina. Pain relief was achieved with nitro paste. ECG changes were noted on the last ECG in the system, unchanged. The patient experienced recurrent chest pain on two occasions, both without ECG changes. The pain seems to be related to the ulcers and chronic shoulder pain.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient is being managed for ongoing UGIB with serial hemoglobin (Hct) checks every six hours, large bore intravenous lines, blood product transfusion, and holding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's chest pain is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal artery stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, and is currently admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) secondary to two gastric ulcers. The patient underwent an endoscopy and one of the ulcers had a bleeding vessel that was clipped. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count have been falling and are being actively transfused.

The patient also presented with chest pain upon arrival, which is likely related to known angina. The pain was relieved with nitro paste. There have been some ECG changes noted, but they have remained unchanged. The patient's troponin and CK-MB levels are being trended.

Additionally, the patient has chronic right shoulder pain for which a lidocaine patch is being tried. The patient's blood glucose levels are well controlled with regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has melena and coffee ground emesis, and endoscopy revealed two gastric ulcers with one having a bleeding vessel that was clipped. The patient's Hct and platelet count are falling, and they are being actively transfused.

2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient experienced chest pain on arrival, which is likely due to known angina. The pain was relieved with nitro paste."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal artery stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, and holocaust survivor. He presented to the emergency department with melena and coffee ground emesis, and was found to have two gastric ulcers during an endoscopy. He also experienced chest pain on arrival, likely related to known angina, which was relieved with nitro paste. The patient has ongoing bleeding, leading to a drop in hemoglobin and platelet count, both of which are being actively transfused. He has a history of chronic right shoulder pain and is currently receiving lidocaine patches for pain relief.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has melena and coffee ground emesis, indicating active bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The endoscopy revealed two gastric ulcers, one with a bleeding vessel that was clipped. The ongoing bleeding has resulted in a drop in hemoglobin and platelet count, necessitating transfusions.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient experienced chest pain upon arrival, which is likely related to his known angina. Although the pain was relieved with nitro paste, it recurred twice without any changes in the ECG. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting raises concerns for possible ACS.
3. Renal failure: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with chest pain on [**2196-8-7**] at 02:00 PM. An EKG was performed at 08:00 AM and another at 02:00 PM, with the second one showing some changes. The patient was given 0.3mg SL nitro, which provided relief. Troponins peaked at 0.22. The patient's diet was restarted, and pertinent home medications were resumed. There are no known drug allergies.

Review of Systems:
The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the chest pain.

Vital Signs and Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (98°F) at one point, with a current temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F).
- Heart rate: 63 bpm, within normal range.
- Blood pressure: Initially 109/41 mmHg, fluctuating between 84/37 and 175/77 mmHg.
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute, within normal range.
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula.
- Sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,686 mL, with 1,190 mL given orally, 504 mL through IV fluids, and 977 mL of blood products. The total output is 1,125 mL, consisting of 1,125 mL of urine. The calculated balance is 1,561 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, maintaining SpO2 at 100%. The patient's ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other systems.

Lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. Creatinine levels are within normal range, while troponin levels peaked at 0.22. Other lab values, including electrolytes, kidney function, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being provided ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is pending further evaluation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of coronary artery disease and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions. He presented with hematemesis and an upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) was identified. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed ulcers with a visible vessel that was subsequently clipped. The patient also experienced chest pain responsive to sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) and showed improvement.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions. There are no known drug allergies. He is currently receiving various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), lidocaine, isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil), vitamins E and D, quetiapine (Seroquel), and trazodone.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the gastrointestinal system, where the patient denies abdominal pain, nausea, or emesis.

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (98°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/48 mmHg to 175/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Flowsheet data shows an adequate fluid balance, with total intake exceeding output."
