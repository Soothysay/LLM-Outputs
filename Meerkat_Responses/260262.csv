   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 year old male with asthma, hypertension, and
   osteoarthritis now post-operative day 2 from a left total knee
   replacement, transfered to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and
   acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Resolved with fluids.
   Differential includes
   1) perioperative hypovolemia, [**Doctor First Name **], antihypertensives not excreted.
   2) drug reaction in setting of rash
   3) bleed, given dropping hematocrit.
   Have ruled out PE, cardiac event with normal ECHO and VQ scan.  Also no
   sign of infection.
   - cultures neg to date, will f/u
 now off antibiotics as have been neg
   x 48hrs
   - Will see if can add tryptase to labs from [**3-14**] to see if this supports
   reaction to dilaudid PCA
   .
   # Anemia: Hct dropped more than expected for knee surgery. Today was 21
   with recheck 24. No clear evidence of active bleeding. Has not had
   bowel movements
 would expect if had GIB would have passed stool.
   - known to have gotten large bolus of Heparin (PTT was over 150) and
   then lovenox simultaneously
   - no signs or symptoms of RP or thigh bleed
   - will check hemolysis labs and get type and cross, transfuse if
   continues to drop.
   - discuss with ortho
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Remains in sinus tachycardia, even after fluid
   resuscitation. Pt asymptomatic.
   - Monitoring trend, f/u EKG in AM
   - control pain
   .
   #.  Acute renal failure, decreased urine output: Improved with IVF,
   presumed prerenal vs ATN.
   - continue to monitor.
   .
   #. Total Knee replacement: Orthopedics aware of transfer, appreciate
   co-management of patient. Drain in place currently.
   - continue pain control with percocet.
   .
   #. Asthma: Breathing comfortably
   - Continue home medications: fluticasone, holding albuterol given
   tachycardia (xoponex if needed)
   .
   #. Rash: Suspect this is a drug rash, either secondary to ceftaz or
   dilaudid, as he received both on day of surgery and morning following.
   His symptoms started the morning of POD 1. His rash continues to
   improve and is less itchy today.
   - Sarna, atarax. Avoid benadryl as pt reports reaction upstairs.
   - Monitor trend, if worsens consider derm c/s
   .
   #. Hypertension: Resolved, can restart meds as tolerates

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 year old male with asthma, hypertension, and
   osteoarthritis now post-operative day 2 from a left total knee
   replacement, transfered to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and
   acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Differential includes hypovolemia from poor PO intake
   coupled with continuing home anti-hypertensive medications and fluid
   shifts and losses post-operatively, pulmonary embolism (lack of
   worsening A-a gradient and appropriate prophylaxis make this less
   likely), cardiac event (no symptoms to suggest this, and flat cardiac
   enzymes), medication reaction (no current anaphylaxis symptoms, but
   could have been related to dilaudid given rash and apparent development
   of hypotension subsequently, could be histamine mediated reaction). No
   evidence to suggest bleeding (HCT stable), or pulmonary etiology (eg
   PTX). Given rising lactate and hypotension with recent surgery, sepsis
   is also a possibility. Concurrent renal insufficiency with hypotension
   envoke possibility of dissection, however patient was not hypertensive,
   has equal pulses, and no symptoms to support this (very mild back pain
   is chronic). Patient had not received a lot of sedating or pain
   medications that could account either, though they would be slower to
   clear given ARF.
   - Repeat EKG in morning, given lack of symptoms will not cycle enzymes
   as were WNL when hypotension had been going on for >6 hours
   - Heparin gtt for possible PE, will follow up with V/Q scan given dye
   load of CTA would not be ideal in setting of renal failure
   - Consider transthoracic echo to evaluate LVEF, structure
   - Blood, urine cultures for possible infectious etiologies
   - Will see if can add tryptase to labs from [**3-14**] to see if this supports
   reaction to dilaudid PCA
   - Aggressive IVF resuscitation, targeting MAP >60, as may not make as
   much urine if truly had ATN.
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Patient in sinus tachycardia, was as high as 130,
   coming down to 100's to 110's with IVFs. Suspect this is appropriate
   response to compensate for necessary cardiac output given intravascular
   depletion/hemoconcentration as supported by rise in creatinine and HCT.
   - Monitoring trend, f/u EKG in AM
   - IVF
   .
   #.  Acute renal failure, decreased urine output:
   Patient had an acute rise in his creatinine today from 0.9 to 1.9, now
   up to 2.1. His urine output has also markedly declined. Suspect that
   given persistent hypotension he likely has some degree of ATN. His FeNa
   supports a pre-renal etiology. This may have been due to poor PO intake
   peri and post-operatively, intra-operative fluid shifts and losses, and
   continuation of his home BP regimen. No known exposure to dye, and no
   clear nephrotoxic medications administered. Post-obstructive less
   likely given functioning foley in place.
   - IVF rescusitation
   - Urine electrolytes sent
   - Repeat U/A with sediment now
   - Monitor UOP, creatinine trend, if worsening consider renal consult
   - Maintain MAP >60 to optimize perfusion
   .
   #. Total Knee replacement: Orthopedics aware of transfer, appreciate
   co-management of patient. Drain in place currently.
   .
   #. Asthma: Currently without any respiratory complaints. Although mild
   dyspnea earlier in evening could have been secondary to PE or other
   etiology, given improvement after nebulizer and typical nature, suspect
   secondary to long standing asthma.
   - Continue home medications: fluticasone, holding albuterol given
   tachycardia (xoponex if needed)
   .
   #. Anemia: Stable since post-operative day 1 (pre-operative HCT was
   38). No evidence of bleeding. Guaiac negative when checked upstairs.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   #. Rash: Suspect this is a drug rash, either secondary to ceftaz or
   dilaudid, as he received both on day of surgery and morning following.
   His symptoms started the morning of POD 1. His rash continues to
   improve and is less itchy today.
   - Sarna, atarax/benadryl PRN
   - Monitor trend, if worsens consider derm c/s
   .
   #. Hypertension: Holding medications in setting of hypotension. Will
   likely need to restart once stabalized.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF boluses as noted above. Repleting electrolytes, regular
   diet once stabalized.
   .
   # PPX:
   -DVT ppx--on heparin gtt until V/Q completed
   -Bowel regimen: Colace, senna
   -Pain management with percocet for post-operative pain

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 128/54 mmHg to 146/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to hypovolemia from poor oral intake, continuing home anti-hypertensive medications, fluid shifts and losses post-operatively, pulmonary embolism, cardiac event, or medication reaction. Given the rising lactate and hypotension with recent surgery, sepsis is also a possibility.

2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, likely as a response to compensate for necessary cardiac output given intravascular depletion/hemoconcentration.

3. Acute renal failure, decreased urine output: The patient has had an acute rise in creatinine from 0.9 to 1.9, now up to 2.1, along with a decline in urine output. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 year old male with asthma, hypertension, and
   osteoarthritis now post-operative day 2 from a left total knee
   replacement, transfered to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and
   acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Differential includes hypovolemia from poor PO intake
   coupled with continuing home anti-hypertensive medications and fluid
   shifts and losses post-operatively, pulmonary embolism (lack of
   worsening A-a gradient and appropriate prophylaxis make this less
   likely), cardiac event (no symptoms to suggest this, and flat cardiac
   enzymes), medication reaction (no current anaphylaxis symptoms, but
   could have been related to dilaudid given rash and apparent development
   of hypotension subsequently, could be histamine mediated reaction). No
   evidence to suggest bleeding (HCT stable), or pulmonary etiology (eg
   PTX). Given rising lactate and hypotension with recent surgery, sepsis
   is also a possibility. Concurrent renal insufficiency with hypotension
   envoke possibility of dissection, however patient was not hypertensive,
   has equal pulses, and no symptoms to support this (very mild back pain
   is chronic). Patient had not received a lot of sedating or pain
   medications that could account either, though they would be slower to
   clear given ARF.
   - Repeat EKG in morning, given lack of symptoms will not cycle enzymes
   as were WNL when hypotension had been going on for >6 hours
   - Heparin gtt for possible PE, will follow up with V/Q scan given dye
   load of CTA would not be ideal in setting of renal failure
   - Consider transthoracic echo to evaluate LVEF, structure
   - Blood, urine cultures for possible infectious etiologies
   - Will see if can add tryptase to labs from [**3-14**] to see if this supports
   reaction to dilaudid PCA
   - Aggressive IVF resuscitation, targeting MAP >60, as may not make as
   much urine if truly had ATN.
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Patient in sinus tachycardia, was as high as 130,
   coming down to 100's to 110's with IVFs. Suspect this is appropriate
   response to compensate for necessary cardiac output given intravascular
   depletion/hemoconcentration as supported by rise in creatinine and HCT.
   - Monitoring trend, f/u EKG in AM
   - IVF
   .
   #.  Acute renal failure, decreased urine output:
   Patient had an acute rise in his creatinine today from 0.9 to 1.9, now
   up to 2.1. His urine output has also markedly declined. Suspect that
   given persistent hypotension he likely has some degree of ATN. His FeNa
   supports a pre-renal etiology. This may have been due to poor PO intake
   peri and post-operatively, intra-operative fluid shifts and losses, and
   continuation of his home BP regimen. No known exposure to dye, and no
   clear nephrotoxic medications administered. Post-obstructive less
   likely given functioning foley in place.
   - IVF rescusitation
   - Urine electrolytes sent
   - Repeat U/A with sediment now
   - Monitor UOP, creatinine trend, if worsening consider renal consult
   - Maintain MAP >60 to optimize perfusion
   .
   #. Total Knee replacement: Orthopedics aware of transfer, appreciate
   co-management of patient. Drain in place currently.
   .
   #. Asthma: Currently without any respiratory complaints. Although mild
   dyspnea earlier in evening could have been secondary to PE or other
   etiology, given improvement after nebulizer and typical nature, suspect
   secondary to long standing asthma.
   - Continue home medications: fluticasone, holding albuterol given
   tachycardia (xoponex if needed)
   .
   #. Anemia: Stable since post-operative day 1 (pre-operative HCT was
   38). No evidence of bleeding. Guaiac negative when checked upstairs.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   #. Rash: Suspect this is a drug rash, either secondary to ceftaz or
   dilaudid, as he received both on day of surgery and morning following.
   His symptoms started the morning of POD 1. His rash continues to
   improve and is less itchy today.
   - Sarna, atarax/benadryl PRN
   - Monitor trend, if worsens consider derm c/s
   .
   #. Hypertension: Holding medications in setting of hypotension. Will
   likely need to restart once stabalized.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF boluses as noted above. Repleting electrolytes, regular
   diet once stabalized.
   .
   # PPX:
   -DVT ppx--on heparin gtt until V/Q completed
   -Bowel regimen: Colace, senna
   -Pain management with percocet for post-operative pain

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. He is post-operative day 2 from a left total knee replacement and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and acute renal failure. The patient's fever has been present since the previous day. Hemolysis labs are negative, but there are schistocytes and other abnormal RBC morphologic findings. The patient is receiving IV fluids and blood transfusion. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/71 to 171/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's cardiac examination reveals tachycardia and a flat JVP. Lung examination is clear bilaterally without any abnormal sounds. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with no signs of bleeding. Extremities show no edema or calf pain, and pulses are equal and strong. Neurological examination is grossly intact. The patient has a macular rash along his trunk and arms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and recent knee surgery.
- He presented with hypotension that resolved with volume resuscitation.
- The patient also experienced renal insufficiency, which resolved with volume resuscitation.
- He developed anemia of unclear etiology, with no obvious bleeding and no evidence of active bleeding on CT scan.
- Hematology team is following up, and further investigations are pending.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he has not required recent volume resuscitation.
- Acute renal failure/acute tubular necrosis (ARF/ATN) has resolved with volume resuscitation.
- The source of fevers remains unclear, with negative chest X-ray, blood cultures, and urine cultures. The patient is not currently on antibiotics.
- The patient's asthma should continue with inhalers.
- The rest of the plan is per ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's anemia is of unclear etiology and may require further investigation and management by the hematology team.
2. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, monitoring should continue to ensure it does not recur.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): While the patient's ARF has resolved, there is still a possibility of renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin"
