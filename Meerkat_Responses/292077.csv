   24 Hour Events:
   Patient became more conversant overnight. Complained of intractable
   rectal pain around 4am. She said nothing works for her, and she was
   discouraged that she's feeling the same pain as she was prior to the
   ketamine infusion. She did not want any further medications. But stated
   that she was ""tired of being sick"" and wanted a new body.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a  60 yo F with altered mental status s/p ketamine infusion.
   .
   #  Altered mental status: Secondary to ketamine infusion for pain
   control on [**4-5**]. Potential hallucinations, depersonalization related to
   ketamine. Patient has had similar sx in the setting of anesthesia. CT
   head negative for acute pathology. CBC, chem 7 within normal limits.
   Urine and serum tox negative. Toxicology and neurology consulted in ED
   who recommended no further interventions, just close monitoring. Narcan
   x2 administered in ED without effect. Patient alert, awake, though
   unable to converse on admission to MICU. Seems much improved this
   morning. Interacting appropriately.
   - q4 hour neuro checks
   - monitor RR and O2 sat for hypoventilation. Consider ABG if RR<12
   - follow up with toxicology and neurology this AM
   .
   #  Chronic pelvic and rectal pain: Patient on complicated outpatient
   pain regimen. Held all sedatives and narcotics with concern for
   respiratory depression.
   -restart home pain medications including fentanyl patch, lidocaine
   patch, Wellbutrin, Celexa, Nortryptilline, and Lyrica this AM
   -Psychiatry consult given that much of this seems to be related to
   depression. Prior records have recommended that the patient be
   evaluated by psychiatry, however she has not followed up with them.
   Patient seems frustrated and passively suicidal.
   .
   #  h/o hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient synthroid 125mcg po daily
   .
   # h/o Raynaud's syndrome: Continue ASA 325mg po daily
   .
   # h/o HTN: Patient on Amlodipine 5mg po daily.
   -consider restarting this AM
   .
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF, replete electrolytes, advance diet as mental
   status clears
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: peripherals

   Present for the key portions of the resident

   Quite important we make a major effort to help her obtain psychiatric

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with altered mental status following a ketamine infusion for pain control. The patient complains of intractable rectal pain and expresses frustration and passive suicidal thoughts. She has a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, and Raynaud's syndrome. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/68 to 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's neurological examination reveals normal cranial nerve function, symmetric reflexes, and normal muscle tone. However, she does not move her extremities upon command, although she was observed lifting her right arm to find a remote control, and her toes are downgoing bilaterally. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels. Imaging of the head reveals no acute intracranial pathology. The patient's pain regimen will be restarted, including fentanyl patch, lidocaine patch, Wellbutrin, Celexa, Nortryptilline, and Lyrica. Psychiatry consultation is recommended due to the patient's depressive symptoms and passive suicidal ideation. The patient's other medical conditions will be managed accordingly. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor for further care, requiring social work and psychiatric consultations."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a  60 yo F with altered mental status s/p ketamine infusion.
   .
   #  Altered mental status: Secondary to ketamine infusion for pain
   control on [**4-5**]. Potential hallucinations, depersonalization related to
   ketamine. Patient has had similar sx in the setting of anesthesia. CT
   head negative for acute pathology. CBC, chem 7 within normal limits.
   Urine and serum tox negative. Toxicology and neurology consulted in ED
   who recommended no further interventions, just close monitoring. Narcan
   x2 administered in ED without effect. Patient alert, awake, though
   unable to converse on admission to MICU. Seems much improved this
   morning. Interacting appropriately.
   - q4 hour neuro checks
   - monitor RR and O2 sat for hypoventilation. Consider ABG if RR<12
   - follow up with toxicology and neurology this AM
   .
   #  Chronic pelvic and rectal pain: Patient on complicated outpatient
   pain regimen. Held all sedatives and narcotics with concern for
   respiratory depression.
   -restart home pain medications including fentanyl patch, lidocaine
   patch, Wellbutrin, Celexa, Nortryptilline, and Lyrica this AM
   -Psychiatry consult given that much of this seems to be related to
   depression. Prior records have recommended that the patient be
   evaluated by psychiatry, however she has not followed up with them.
   Patient seems frustrated and passively suicidal.

   #  h/o hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient synthroid 125mcg po daily
   .
   # h/o Raynaud's syndrome: Continue ASA 325mg po daily

   # h/o HTN: Patient on Amlodipine 5mg po daily.
   -consider restarting this AM

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with altered mental status following a ketamine infusion for pain control. She complained of intractable rectal pain overnight and expressed feelings of being tired of being sick. The patient has multiple allergies and a history of hypothyroidism, Raynaud's syndrome, hypertension, and chronic pelvic and rectal pain. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/68 to 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Her laboratory results are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count. Imaging studies show no acute intracranial pathology. The patient's pain medications were held due to concerns about respiratory depression, but it is planned to restart them along with other home pain medications in the morning. A psychiatry consult has been requested due to the patient's frustration and passive suicidal ideation. The patient is currently alert and awake, interacting appropriately, and does not require further interventions at this time. Close monitoring of her neurological status, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation is recommended. Disposition will be discussed with the floor team today, including the need for social work and psychiatric consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure occasionally drops below the normal range, indicating a potential risk for"
