   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is
   admitted after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to
   MICU after code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress
   requiring intubation. Report from OSH MRI of evidence of acute stroke.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient with likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
   in the setting of pulmonary infection. Given in-hospital aspiration
   event, is likely to be considered a HAP. Is s/p intubation with
   acceptable oxygen saturations overnight. Had BAL yesterday with gram
   stain showing GPCs in pairs and clusters. Likely not ACS given 5 sets
   of negative cardiac enzymes since presentation to the hospital.
   - Switch from AC to PSV for preparation for ventilator liberation.
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem until further culture data
   available
   - Follow-up BAL culture
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up BNP
   # Hypotension:
   Was evident after intubation sedation. Repeat episode of hypotension
   following midaz administration during bronch. Patient also likely to be
   hypovolemic due to reported poor PO intake prior to presentation to the
   hospital. Now with A-line monitoring of blood pressure. Chance that
   this is cardiogenic hypotension.
   - Continue to hold BP meds.
   - Treat infection
   - Check TTE
   # Altered mental status/lethargy:
   Known acute stroke at OSH; also was hypercarbic at time of code which
   could be cause or contributor.  Metabolic abnls include hypothroidism
   and hyponatremia.
   - Neuro stroke is following along and appreciate their recs
   - Obtain OSH MRI images.
   - Repeat MRI given evolving nature of neuro deficits
   - Correction of metabolic/electrolyte abnls.
   - infectious workup - urine, sputum, bloods.
   - Carotid dopplers
   - TTE
   - Continue aspirin and atorvastatin
   # Thoracic spine compression fractures:
   Question of acuity of the fracture.
   - Appreciate Ortho Spine recs
   - Hold inhaled calcitonin when able and lidoderm patch.
   # Hyponatremia:
   Urine osm and Na are consistent with SIADH, possibly mediated by pain
   afferents in the setting of vertebral compression fractures vs.
   pulmonary process. Of note, patient also has a remote history of small
   cell lung CA, which can be associated with SIADH, though has been in
   remission for ~ 8  years.  TSH is slightly elevated with normal free
   T4, making hypothyroidism unlikely contributor. Also consider that in
   setting of poor PO intake recently patient has had excess of free water
   intake related to solute intake.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Free water restrict with tube feeds
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. She was admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks and had a code blue for altered mental status and respiratory distress, requiring intubation. An MRI showed evidence of an acute stroke. The patient is now in the MICU with respiratory failure, likely due to a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) secondary to an in-hospital aspiration event. She is also experiencing hypotension, altered mental status/lethargy, and hyponatremia. The patient has a history of small cell lung cancer, which can be associated with SIADH. She also has thoracic spine compression fractures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to pulmonary infection. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation if not properly managed.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's aspiration event in the hospital may have led to HAP. If not treated appropriately, this can result in worsening lung infection and respiratory failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's repeated episodes of hypotension may indicate a low blood volume or cardiac dysfunction. It is important to closely monitor and manage her blood pressure to prevent further complications.
4. Altered mental status/lethargy: The patient's altered mental status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a code blue for altered mental status and respiratory distress, requiring intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, altered mental status, and acute stroke. She also has a history of thoracic spine compression fractures, hyponatremia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered mental status, decreased responsiveness, and hypoxia indicate respiratory failure. This could be due to hypoventilation caused by mental status changes, aspiration, mucous plugging, or an acute coronary event.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to intubation medications. Other possible causes include cardiogenic shock or sepsis.
3. Altered Mental Status/Lethargy: The patient's altered mental status may be caused by an acute stroke, hypercarbia at the time of code, or metabolic abnormalities such as hypothyroidism and hyponatremia.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is
   admitted after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to
   MICU after code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress
   requiring intubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient with altered mental status worsening
   throughout the day associated with poor mental status and decreased
   responsiveness.  Hypoxia differential includes hypoventilation due to
   mental status, aspiration, mucous plugging, acute coronary event.
   - Initiate on AC 400 x 16/PEEP 5, wean FiO2.
   - CXR now.
   - Check BNP.
   - Treatment of likely HCAP/?aspiration pneumonia - vanc, meropenem (pcn
   allergy) for now.
   - Cycle enzymes; no significant changes on ECG.
   - workup of altered mental status as below.
   .
   # Hypotension.  Likely related to intubation meds.  Also consider
   cardiogenic shock or sepsis as a cause.  Improved now.  Also keep in
   mind acute stroke and desire for adequate cerebral perfusion pressures.
   - Aline.
   - Hold BP meds.
   - Infectious workup and coverage.
   - TTE and cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Altered mental status/lethargy.  Known acute stroke at OSH; also was
   hypercarbic at time of code which could be cause or contributor.
   Metabolic abnls include hypothroidism and hyponatremia.
   - update neuro stroke.
   - obtain OSH MRI images.
   - Repeat head CT to rule out acute bleed or change, vs. repeat MRI.
   - Correction of metabolic/electrolyte abnls.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancer in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension.
- She was admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks and subsequently had a code blue for altered mental status and respiratory distress, requiring intubation.
- The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypoxia, hypotension, altered mental status, and potential aspiration pneumonia.
- She has multiple medical complications such as acute stroke, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, thoracic spine compression fractures, and a remote history of small cell lung cancer.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia.
- The patient's plan includes initiating antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, continuing home dose of thyroid medication, monitoring serum sodium levels, and checking plasma osmolality.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and altered mental status may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's altered mental status, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to lung infection and worsening respiratory status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with hypotension requiring fluid bolus. He has undergone intubation, bronchoscopy, and arterial line placement. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 82/31 to 175/76 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and decreased mobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients are at higher risk for stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion and mucosal damage.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which is common in ICU patients.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's laboratory values show a decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine, indicating the possibility of AKI."

   Assessment and Plan
   73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is admitted
   after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to MICU after
   code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring
   intubation. Report from OSH MRI of evidence of acute stroke.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient with likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
   in the setting of pulmonary infection. Given in-hospital aspiration
   event, is likely to be considered a HAP. Is s/p intubation with
   acceptable oxygen saturations overnight. Had BAL yesterday with gram
   stain showing GPCs in pairs and clusters. Likely not ACS given 5 sets
   of negative cardiac enzymes since presentation to the hospital.
   - Switch from AC to PSV for preparation for ventilator liberation.
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem until further culture data
   available
   - Follow-up BAL culture
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up BNP
   # Hypotension:
   Was evident after intubation sedation. Repeat episode of hypotension
   following midaz administration during bronch. Patient also likely to be
   hypovolemic due to reported poor PO intake prior to presentation to the
   hospital. Now with A-line monitoring of blood pressure. Chance that
   this is cardiogenic hypotension.
   - Continue to hold BP meds.
   - Treat infection
   - Check TTE
   # Altered mental status/lethargy:
   Known acute stroke at OSH; also was hypercarbic at time of code which
   could be cause or contributor.  Metabolic abnls include hypothroidism
   and hyponatremia.
   - Neuro stroke is following along and appreciate their recs
   - Obtain OSH MRI images.
   - Repeat MRI given evolving nature of neuro deficits
   - Correction of metabolic/electrolyte abnls.
   - infectious workup - urine, sputum, bloods.
   - Carotid dopplers
   - TTE
   - Continue aspirin and atorvastatin
   # Thoracic spine compression fractures:
   Question of acuity of the fracture.
   - Appreciate Ortho Spine recs
   - Hold inhaled calcitonin when able and lidoderm patch.
   # Hyponatremia:
   Urine osm and Na are consistent with SIADH, possibly mediated by pain
   afferents in the setting of vertebral compression fractures vs.
   pulmonary process. Of note, patient also has a remote history of small
   cell lung CA, which can be associated with SIADH, though has been in
   remission for ~ 8  years.  TSH is slightly elevated with normal free
   T4, making hypothyroidism unlikely contributor. Also consider that in
   setting of poor PO intake recently patient has had excess of free water
   intake related to solute intake.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Free water restrict with tube feeds
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancer in remission, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. She was admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks and subsequently had a code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient has evidence of acute stroke on MRI and is currently in the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure in the setting of pulmonary infection. Given the in-hospital aspiration event, she is likely to be considered a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The plan is to switch from assist-control (AC) to pressure support ventilation (PSV) for preparation for ventilator liberation.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension after intubation sedation and during the administration of midazolam. She is also likely to be hypovolemic due to poor oral intake prior to presentation. Repeat episodes of hypotension may indicate cardiogenic hypotension. The plan is to continue holding blood pressure medications, treat the infection, and check for any cardiac abnormalities using a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

3. Altered mental status/lethargy: The patient has an acute stroke, hypercarbia at the time of code, and metabolic abnormalities including hypothyroidism and hyponatremia. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is admitted
   after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to MICU after
   code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring
   intubation. Report from OSH MRI of evidence of acute stroke.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient with likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
   in the setting of pulmonary infection. Given in-hospital aspiration
   event, is likely to be considered a HAP. Is s/p intubation with
   acceptable oxygen saturations overnight. Had BAL yesterday with gram
   stain showing GPCs in pairs and clusters. Likely not ACS given 5 sets
   of negative cardiac enzymes since presentation to the hospital. BNP
   from yesterday was 3110, indicating some component of volume overload.
   Her fluid balance yesterday was 3.6 L positive. SBT did not go well
   this AM.
   - Maintain on PSV for now with lowest tolerated settings
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem for now and discontinue if negative
   BAL culture for 48 hours
   - Follow-up BAL culture
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Diurese today
   # Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis:
   Known acute stroke at OSH; also was hypercarbic at time of code which
   could be cause or contributor. MRI yesterday revealed question of
Scattered tiny foci of possible slow diffusion in the right middle
   cerebral artery distribution
, also question of
stenosis of the distal
   right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery, or perhaps an embolus
   in this location.
 Radiology and neurology agree that CTA head will
   help to further clarify etiology of stroke.
   - Head CTA today to further characterize stroke
   - Heparin anticoagulation pending CTA results and neurology input
   - Neuro stroke is following along and ongoing input
   - Comparison of OSH MRI with MRI from here that was obtained yesterday
   - Continue aspirin and atorvastatin
   # Hypotension:
   Was evident after intubation sedation. Repeat episode of hypotension
   following midaz administration during bronch. Patient also likely to be
   hypovolemic due to reported poor PO intake prior to presentation to the
   hospital. Now with A-line monitoring of blood pressure. Chance that
   this is cardiogenic hypotension. ECHO yesterday with LVEF = 45-50%,
   this combined with BNP of ~3000 indicates that some component of
   hypotension may be cardiogenic.
   - Continue to hold BP meds
   - Diruese today as tolerated by blood pressure
   # Thoracic spine compression fractures:
   MRI T-spine from yesterday reports that these are acute compression
   fractures with retropulsion of fragment.
   - Appreciate Ortho Spine recs
   # Hyponatremia:
   Hyponatremia is normalized at this time with AM sodium of 133. TSH
   elevated at 11 with normal free T4.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Free water restrict with tube feeds
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and previous falls. She was admitted after experiencing respiratory distress and altered mental status, requiring intubation. The patient has evidence of an acute stroke on MRI, as well as respiratory failure with mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has hypotension and hyponatremia, which has since normalized. The patient also has thoracic spine compression fractures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure needs to be managed carefully to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Stroke: The patient's acute stroke requires further evaluation with a head computed tomography angiography (CTA) to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia needs to be treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics based on the BAL culture results.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires careful monitoring and management, including fluid resuscitation and consideration of cardiogenic causes.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia should be monitored closely, and appropriate interventions such as free water restriction and continuation of levothyroxine should be implemented.
6. Thoracic Spine Compression Fractures: The patient's compression fractures need to be managed by an orthopedic specialist"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is admitted
   after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to MICU after
   code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring
   intubation. Report from OSH MRI of evidence of acute stroke.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient with likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
   in the setting of pulmonary infection. Given in-hospital aspiration
   event, is likely to be considered a HAP. Is s/p intubation with
   acceptable oxygen saturations overnight. Had BAL yesterday with gram
   stain showing GPCs in pairs and clusters. Likely not ACS given 5 sets
   of negative cardiac enzymes since presentation to the hospital. BNP
   from yesterday was 3110, indicating some component of volume overload.
   Her fluid balance yesterday was 3.6 L positive. SBT did not go well
   this AM.
   - Maintain on PSV for now with lowest tolerated settings
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem for now and discontinue if negative
   BAL culture for 48 hours
   - Follow-up BAL culture
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Diurese today
   # Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis:
   Known acute stroke at OSH; also was hypercarbic at time of code which
   could be cause or contributor. MRI yesterday revealed question of
Scattered tiny foci of possible slow diffusion in the right middle
   cerebral artery distribution
, also question of
stenosis of the distal
   right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery, or perhaps an embolus
   in this location.
 Radiology and neurology agree that CTA head will
   help to further clarify etiology of stroke.
   - Head CTA today to further characterize stroke
   - Heparin anticoagulation pending CTA results and neurology input
   - Neuro stroke is following along and ongoing input
   - Comparison of OSH MRI with MRI from here that was obtained yesterday
   - Continue aspirin and atorvastatin
   # Hypotension:
   Was evident after intubation sedation. Repeat episode of hypotension
   following midaz administration during bronch. Patient also likely to be
   hypovolemic due to reported poor PO intake prior to presentation to the
   hospital. Now with A-line monitoring of blood pressure. Chance that
   this is cardiogenic hypotension. ECHO yesterday with LVEF = 45-50%,
   this combined with BNP of ~3000 indicates that some component of
   hypotension may be cardiogenic.
   - Continue to hold BP meds
   - Diruese today as tolerated by blood pressure
   # Thoracic spine compression fractures:
   MRI T-spine from yesterday reports that these are acute compression
   fractures with retropulsion of fragment.
   - Appreciate Ortho Spine recs
   # Hyponatremia:
   Hyponatremia is normalized at this time with AM sodium of 133. TSH
   elevated at 11 with normal free T4.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Free water restrict with tube feeds
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. She was admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks and later transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) after a code blue for altered mental status and respiratory distress, requiring intubation. The patient has evidence of acute stroke.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely due to a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. She was intubated and maintained on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with the lowest tolerated settings. BAL culture and blood cultures are pending, and diuresis is planned today.
2. Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis: The patient has altered mental status, lethargy, and left-sided hemiparesis, which are consistent with an acute stroke. A head CT angiography (CTA) is ordered today to further characterize the stroke etiology. Heparin anticoagulation is pending CTA results and neurology input.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension after intubation sedation and following midazolam administration. She is also likely hypovolemic due to poor oral intake prior to presentation. An echocardi"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is admitted
   after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to MICU after
   code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring
   intubation. Report from OSH MRI of evidence of acute stroke.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient with likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
   in the setting of pulmonary infection. Given in-hospital aspiration
   event, is likely to be considered a HAP. Is s/p intubation with
   acceptable oxygen saturations overnight. Had BAL yesterday with gram
   stain showing GPCs in pairs and clusters. Likely not ACS given 5 sets
   of negative cardiac enzymes since presentation to the hospital. BNP
   from yesterday was 3110, indicating some component of volume overload.
   Her fluid balance yesterday was 3.6 L positive. SBT did not go well
   this AM.
   - Maintain on PSV for now with lowest tolerated settings
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem for now and discontinue if negative
   BAL culture for 48 hours
   - Follow-up BAL culture
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Diurese today
   # Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis:
   Known acute stroke at OSH; also was hypercarbic at time of code which
   could be cause or contributor. MRI yesterday revealed question of
Scattered tiny foci of possible slow diffusion in the right middle
   cerebral artery distribution
, also question of
stenosis of the distal
   right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery, or perhaps an embolus
   in this location.
 Radiology and neurology agree that CTA head will
   help to further clarify etiology of stroke.
   - Head CTA today to further characterize stroke
   - Heparin anticoagulation pending CTA results and neurology input
   - Neuro stroke is following along and ongoing input
   - Comparison of OSH MRI with MRI from here that was obtained yesterday
   - Continue aspirin and atorvastatin
   # Hypotension:
   Was evident after intubation sedation. Repeat episode of hypotension
   following midaz administration during bronch. Patient also likely to be
   hypovolemic due to reported poor PO intake prior to presentation to the
   hospital. Now with A-line monitoring of blood pressure. Chance that
   this is cardiogenic hypotension. ECHO yesterday with LVEF = 45-50%,
   this combined with BNP of ~3000 indicates that some component of
   hypotension may be cardiogenic.
   - Continue to hold BP meds
   - Diruese today as tolerated by blood pressure
   # Thoracic spine compression fractures:
   MRI T-spine from yesterday reports that these are acute compression
   fractures with retropulsion of fragment.
   - Appreciate Ortho Spine recs
   # Hyponatremia:
   Hyponatremia is normalized at this time with AM sodium of 133. TSH
   elevated at 11 with normal free T4.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Free water restrict with tube feeds
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks and later had a code blue due to altered mental status and respiratory distress, requiring intubation. 

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, possibly due to pulmonary infection. She was intubated overnight with acceptable oxygen saturations. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture showed gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in pairs and clusters, suggesting a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV).

2. Altered Mental Status/Lethargy/Left-Sided Hemiparesis: The patient has an acute stroke, as indicated by her altered mental status, lethargy, and left-sided weakness. A CT angiography (CTA) of the head is planned to further characterize the stroke. The patient is also on heparin anticoagulation pending CTA results and neurology input.

3. Thoracic Spine Compression Fractures: The patient has acute compression fractures in her thoracic spine, with retropulsion of a fragment. Orthopedic spine recommendations have been appreciated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is left-sided weakness and aspiration. 

The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including MRI/MRA, CTA Head, and Carotid U/S. The results indicate stenosis of the distal right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), occlusion of the left common carotid artery (CCA) with reversal of flow in the left external carotid artery (ECA), and no change in the right internal carotid artery (ICA). These findings suggest a possible stroke caused by an embolus in the location of the occluded M1 segment of the right MCA.

Additionally, the patient has acute fractures at T2 and T3 vertebrae with retropulsed fragment compressing the spinal cord and associated edema. The patient is not a candidate for vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty due to the retropulsed fragment, and there are no surgical recommendations at this time due to the risk.

The patient is currently on heparin gtt without bolus per stroke team. There is no information provided about any allergies or recent doses of antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure ranging from 136/56 mmHg to 171/97 mmHg, heart rate between 81 and 106 beats per"

   73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is admitted
   after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to MICU after
   code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring
   intubation. Report from OSH MRI of evidence of acute stroke.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient with likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
   in the setting of aspiration. BAL culture growing only oropharyngeal at
   this time, consistent with aspiration and less concerning for a
   pneumonia. Vanc and meropenem were discontinued on [**2124-3-30**]. Likely not
   ACS given 5 sets of negative cardiac enzymes since presentation to the
   hospital. BNP was 3110, indicating some component of volume overload.
   Was managed yesterday with a  furosemide drip giving 1.9 L negative
   fluid balance in 24 hours.
   - Maintain on PSV for now with lowest tolerated settings
   - Continue furosemide drip today for diuresis
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   # Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis:
   MRI from [**2124-3-28**] as well as CTA head corroborates finding of right MCA
   M1 segment stroke and heparin drip was started per neurology recs.
   - Head CT this AM to assess for ICH following initiation of heparin
   - Neuro stroke is following along and ongoing input in appreciated
   - Continue heparin anticoagulation
   - Continue aspirin and atorvastatin
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Hypotension initially was evident after intubation. Repeat episode of
   hypotension following midaz administration during bronch. ECHO with
   LVEF = 45-50%, this combined with BNP of ~3000 indicates that some
   component of hypotension may have be cardiogenic. Now with intermittent
   hypertension off her home BP meds of valsartan and amlodipine. Overall
   has a labile blood pressure. Our target per neuro recs is SBP 120s to
   170s.
   - Continue amlodipine at 5 mg daily
   - Diruese as tolerated by blood pressure
   # Thoracic spine compression fractures:
   MRI T-spine reports that these are acute compression fractures with
   retropulsion of fragment from T3. No indication for surgery at this
   time.
   - Appreciate ongoing ortho spine recs
   # Hyponatremia:
   Hyponatremia is recurrent this AM with sodium of 129. TSH elevated at
   11 with normal free T4.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Free water restrict with tube feeds
   - Limit free water intake by switching heparin from D5 to NS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancer in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. She was admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks and subsequently had a code blue due to altered mental status and respiratory distress, requiring intubation. An MRI showed evidence of an acute stroke.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. Antibiotics (Vanc and meropenem) have been discontinued as there is no evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia.
2. Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis: The patient has a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment stroke, as confirmed by MRI and CT scan. Heparin anticoagulation has been started, and aspirin and atorvastatin are being continued.
3. Hypertension/hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, with episodes of hypotension after intubation and midazolam administration. There may be a cardiogenic component to the hypotension, given the echocardiogram showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45-50% and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of ~3000.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) after experiencing a code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress, requiring intubation. The patient's MRI showed evidence of an acute stroke.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis, hypertension/hypotension, thoracic spine compression fractures, and hyponatremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration. If not properly managed, this can lead to further respiratory distress, pneumonia, or even respiratory arrest.

2. Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis: The patient has evidence of a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment stroke. If the stroke does not improve or worsens, it can lead to increased neurological deficits, including paralysis on the left side of the body, difficulty speaking, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of acute stroke and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/67 to 208/136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is sedated and moves his right side of the body to verbal command. There is new movement in the left foot this morning. Physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds anteriorly and anterior chest wall tenderness. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels, including hyponatremia. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, malnutrition, impaired aerobic capacity, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, previous cerebrovascular accident, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, which may continue to be a concern due to his ongoing need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Stroke complications: The patient's history of acute stroke increases the risk of further neurological complications such as hemorrhage, seizures, or increased intracranial pressure.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of coarse breath"

   73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is admitted
   after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to MICU after
   code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring
   intubation. Report from OSH MRI of evidence of acute stroke.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient with likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
   in the setting of pulmonary infection. Given in-hospital aspiration
   event, is likely to be considered a HAP. Is s/p intubation with
   acceptable oxygen saturations overnight. BAL culture growing only
   oropharyngeal at this time, consistent with aspiration and less
   concerning for a pneumonia. Likely not ACS given 5 sets of negative
   cardiac enzymes since presentation to the hospital. BNP was 3110,
   indicating some component of volume overload. Was managed yesterday
   with bolus furosemide giving one liter negative fluid balance.
   - Maintain on PSV for now with lowest tolerated settings
   - Discontinue Vanc and [**Last Name (un) 1540**] as no supporting culture data at this time
   - Start furosemide drip today for diuresis
   - Follow-up final BAL culture
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   # Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis:
   MRI from [**2124-3-28**] as well as CTA head from yesterday corroborate
   finding of right MCA M1 segment embolic stroke and heparin drip was
   started per neurology recs.
   - Neuro stroke is following along and ongoing input in appreciated
   - Continue heparin anticoagulation
   - Continue aspirin and atorvastatin
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Hypotension initially was evident after intubation. Repeat episode of
   hypotension following midaz administration during bronch. ECHO with
   LVEF = 45-50%, this combined with BNP of ~3000 indicates that some
   component of hypotension may have be cardiogenic. Now with hypertension
   off her home BP meds of valsartan and amlodipine.
   - Restart amlodipine at 5 mg daily
   - Diruese as tolerated by blood pressure
   # Thoracic spine compression fractures:
   MRI T-spine freports that these are acute compression fractures with
   retropulsion of fragment from T3. No indication for surgery at this
   time.
   - Appreciate ongoing ortho spine recs
   # Hyponatremia:
   Hyponatremia is resolved with AM sodium of 135. TSH elevated at 11 with
   normal free T4.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Free water restrict with tube feeds
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), who was admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks. She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) after experiencing a code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient has evidence of an acute stroke on an MRI.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to pulmonary infection, possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) resulting from an in-hospital aspiration event. This condition requires ongoing monitoring and management.

2. Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis: The patient has an embolic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment, which is causing altered mental status, lethargy, and left-sided hemiparesis. Neurological input is recommended, and the patient should continue with heparin anticoagulation, aspirin, and atorvastatin.

3. Hypertension/hypotension: The patient initially experienced hypotension after intubation and another episode following midazolam administration. Hypotension may be cardiogenic due to a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and recent falls. The patient was admitted after experiencing a code blue due to altered mental status and respiratory distress, requiring intubation. An MRI revealed evidence of an acute stroke.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure in the setting of a pulmonary infection. Given the in-hospital aspiration event, it is likely to be considered hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently on positive pressure support ventilation (PSV) with acceptable oxygen saturations. The plan is to maintain PSV with the lowest tolerated settings, discontinue vancomycin and [**Last Name (un) 1540**] as there is no supporting culture data, start furosemide drip for diuresis, and follow-up with final BAL culture and blood cultures.

2. Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis: The MRI from [**2124-3-28**] as well as CTA head from yesterday corroborate findings of a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment embolic stroke.

It is unlikely to be acute congestive heart failure (ACS) given five sets of negative cardiac enzymes since presentation to the hospital. BNP was 3110, indicating some component of volume overload. The patient was managed yesterday with a furosemide drip, giving 1.9 L negative fluid balance in 24 hours. Lasix gtt was restarted without complications.

The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) at 0/5 for two hours without difficulty, with an RSBI of 71. It is planned to extubate today, with post-extubation chest X-ray and follow-up blood cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-inch tall male weighing 53 kg, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. He was started on meropenem and vancomycin on [**2124-3-30**], but the last doses administered were at 04:24 AM and 08:09 AM, respectively.

The patient's vital signs as of [**2124-4-1**] 07:09 AM are as follows: temperature - 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate - 81 bpm (71-97 bpm), blood pressure - 99/45 mmHg (76/39-170/136 mmHg), respiratory rate - 28 breaths per minute (17-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation - 91%.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions including a PICC line insertion at 12:50 PM on [**2124-3-31**], which led to transient hypotension and temporary hold on Lasix. The patient's ventilator mode was changed to PSV 8, PEEP 5 in the late afternoon. Diamox was started, causing alkalosis. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 214 K/uL. Other lab results include sodium level of 135 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, glucose level of 138 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, tidal volume of 281 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 96. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (PaO2) of 232 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory symptoms is important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses, skin changes, and calf pain/coldness is essential.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and the use of certain medications like corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as melena or hematemesis, is crucial.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings have been fluctuating, indicating potential hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate hemodynamic support may be required.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids (872 mL total in) but has also lost a substantial amount of fluids (2,660 mL total out), resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,788 mL. Monitoring fluid status and adjusting fluid administration accordingly is important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-inch tall, 53 kg male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a recent change to pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode and a decreased peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate between 81-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-170/39-136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient's neurological examination reveals new movement in the left foot this morning. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values are within normal limits or not provided. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics and has a PICC line in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: Prolonged ICU stay and critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.

   Assessment and Plan
   73F with breast and lung cancers in remission, CAD, HTN who is admitted
   after second mechanical fall in two weeks; now transfer to MICU after
   code blue for altered mental status/respiratory distress requiring
   intubation. Report from OSH MRI of evidence of acute stroke.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient with likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure
   in the setting of aspiration. BAL culture growing only oropharyngeal at
   this time, consistent with aspiration and less concerning for a
   pneumonia. Vanc and meropenem were discontinued on [**2124-3-30**]. Likely not
   ACS given 5 sets of negative cardiac enzymes since presentation to the
   hospital. BNP was 3110, indicating some component of volume overload.
   Was managed yesterday with a  furosemide drip giving 1.9 L negative
   fluid balance in 24 hours.  Continued on lasix gtt, had transient
   episode of hypotension for which lasix gtt was turned off but then
   restarted without complications.
   - Maintain on PSV for now with lowest tolerated settings.  Weaned to PS
   [**7-26**], tolerating well.
   - Continue furosemide drip today for diuresis.
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   # Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis:
   MRI from [**2124-3-28**] as well as CTA head corroborates finding of right MCA
   M1 segment stroke and heparin drip was started per neurology recs.  CT
   head without e/o bleed.
   - Neuro stroke is following along and ongoing input in appreciated
   - Continue heparin anticoagulation
   - Continue aspirin and atorvastatin
   # Hypertension / Hypotension:
   Hypotension initially was evident after intubation. Repeat episode of
   hypotension following versed administration during bronch. ECHO with
   LVEF = 45-50%, this combined with BNP of ~3000 indicates that some
   component of hypotension may have be cardiogenic. Now with intermittent
   hypertension off her home BP meds of valsartan and amlodipine. Overall
   has a labile blood pressure. Our target per neuro recs is SBP 120s to
   170s.  Has been having transient hypotension after starting lasix gtt
   with development of alkalosis.  Amlodipine d/c
   - lasix gtt as tolerated by BP, started on diamox for alkalosis.
   - Diruese as tolerated by blood pressure
   # Thoracic spine compression fractures:
   MRI T-spine reports that these are acute compression fractures with
   retropulsion of fragment from T3. No indication for surgery at this
   time per spine surgery.
   - Appreciate ongoing ortho spine recs
   # Hyponatremia:
   Hyponatremia is recurrent this AM with sodium of 129. TSH elevated at
   11 with normal free T4.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Free water restrict with tube feeds
   - Limit free water intake by switching heparin from D5 to NS
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and lung cancers in remission, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. She was admitted after experiencing a second mechanical fall in two weeks and required intubation due to altered mental status and respiratory distress, leading to a code blue event. An MRI of the OSH showed evidence of an acute stroke.

The patient is currently in the MICU with the following medical complications and assessments:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has likely mixed hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration. BAL culture is growing oropharyngeal flora consistent with aspiration and less concerning for pneumonia. Antibiotics (Vanc and meropenem) have been discontinued.

2. Altered mental status/lethargy/left-sided hemiparesis: MRI and CTA head confirm right middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment stroke. Heparin drip has been started per neurology recommendations.

3. Hypertension/hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension initially after intubation and another episode following the administration of versed during bronchoscopy. An echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45-50%, indicating some component of hypotension may be cardiogenic. The patient is now experiencing intermittent hypertension off her home blood pressure medications. The target blood pressure range is SBP "

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of CVA (stroke), coronary artery disease (CAD), and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/45 mmHg to 157/136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume of 265 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 96. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's prolonged intubation and immobility, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia due to aspiration of secretions and colonization by pathogenic organisms.
2. Ventilator-associated events: The patient's mechanical ventilation support increases the risk of ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation, which can lead to potentially life"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of CVA (stroke), coronary artery disease, and hyponatremia, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient is ventilated and has been receiving diuresis treatment. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/45 to 157/136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's recent events include the placement of a PICC line, weaning off vent support, and the administration of antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin). The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted above and below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. If not properly managed, there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Stroke: The patient has a history of CVA, which puts him at increased risk for further neurological complications, including hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotensive episodes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status, respiratory failure, and pneumonia. The patient has a history of CVA, coronary artery disease, and hypomagnesemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 99/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 265 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, platelet count of 214 K/uL, blood glucose level of 103 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, meropenem, vancomycin, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased white blood cell count"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous strokes. He was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 99/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Fluid balance shows an input of 872 mL and output of 2660 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1788 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a low sodium level. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a feeding tube, and glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, PICC line, and venous catheter. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has impaired airway clearance, balance, arousal, attention, cognition, motor function, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, and impaired aerobic capacity/endurance.
