","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of Raynaud's disease, hypertension, and no significant heart or lung history. He presented with intermittent fevers and fatigue for three weeks. A parasite smear was positive for babesiosis, indicating a Babesia infection. The patient also experienced new-onset anemia and thrombocytopenia.

Medical Complications:
1. Babesiosis: The patient has been diagnosed with babesiosis, which is a tick-borne parasitic infection. Treatment includes continuing atovaquone and azithromycin for babesiosis as the patient appears clinically stable. If the patient worsens, a switch to clindamycin-quinine may be considered.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient developed pulmonary edema due to IV fluid administration and new-onset pulmonary artery fibrillation (PAF). The patient reported left leg edema prior to diuresis. The likely cause of pulmonary edema is congestive heart failure (CHF), given lung findings, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), history of valvulopathy, and new-onset arrhythmia. Diuresis with lasix has been initiated. However, the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is only 390, which does not align with severe CHF. Clinical improvement may correlate with the return to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old individual with a history of Raynaud's disease, hypertension, and no significant heart or lung history. The patient presented with intermittent fevers and fatigue for three weeks and tested positive for babesiosis, as confirmed by a parasite smear. The patient also experienced new onset anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are consistent with babesiosis. Other potential causes, such as prolonged viral illness, were considered but seem less likely.

The patient was found to have pulmonary edema, likely due to IV fluid administration and new onset pulmonary arterial fibrillation (PAF). This was accompanied by elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), a history of valvulopathy, and new onset arrhythmia. The patient responded well to diuretics, specifically lasix.

The patient also had hyponatremia, with a sodium level decreasing from 125 to 120. This occurred during ongoing diuresis, and the examination suggested hypervolemic hyponatremia. The urine sodium level was greater than 60, which makes congestive heart failure (CHF) as an etiology less likely. However, SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion) is a possibility, especially considering a possible lung infection.

Additionally, the patient experienced new onset atrial fibrillation (PAF) on July 21st but has since returned to normal"

   This is a  78 y/o with Raynoulds, no significant heart or lung history
   presents from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 608**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with intermittent fevers and fatigue for
   3 weeks and parasite smear + for babesiosis by report and SOB
   # Fevers, maliase: per report parasite smear at [**Hospital1 608**] positive for
   babesiosis. Fatigue, fevers, consistent with Babesiosis, as is recent
   tick exposure. New onset anemia and thrombocytopenia also consistent.
   Prolonged viral illness possible but becoming less likely given
   prolonged time cause.  ? infiltrate on CXR raising ? of new PNA in
   addition given presistent fevver, however on CXR more likely effusions
   with edema
   - Continue Atovoquone and Azithro for Babesiosis as apears clinically
   stable on arrival.
   - consider switch Abx to Clindamycin-quinine if clinically worsens
   - f/u Hemolytic, DIC labs
   - Trend CXR
   - Per ID restarted doxycycline yesterday to cover for lyme.
   - F/U ID recs.
   - Change Tylenol to standing dose rather than PRN for better symptom
   management.
   #  Pulmonary edema: developed in setting of IVF and new onset PAF. Pt
   reports LE edema prior to diuresis. Likely [**2-8**] CHF given lung findings,
   elevated JVP, h/o valvulopathy, and new onset arrthymia. Diuresed well
   with lasix. Clinical improvement may correlate with return to NSR.
   ARDS possible in babesiosis. however pt with other signs of CHF and pt
   with minimal oxygen requirement making ARDS unlikely.
   - hold diuresis given decreased oxygen requirement
   - nebs PRN
   - echo yesterday showed moderate Aortic Regurg.
   #  Hyponatremia. Resolving with Na 126 today with fluid restrictions.
   Exam consistent with hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urine NA > 60,
   suggesting against CHF as etiology but difficult to inerperate in
   setting of recent diuresis. SIADH also possible in setting of possible
   lung infection.
   - Given downtrend in setting of diruesis hold lasix
   - Continue fluid restrict
   - trend NA
   # PAF: New onset Afib [**7-21**]. Now in NSR. Was on lovenox but d/ced.
   - ASA 81mg
   - trend INR
   - continue metopolol
   - hold dig for now, check level given combination of azithro and dig
   - given converted back to NSR and short duration in setting of
   infection, will stop anticoagulation
   #  Anemia:  HCT of 27, down from baseline of 40. NO obvious GI bleed.
   Could be [**2-8**] hemolysis in setting of babesiosis.  LDH slightly elevated
   but tbili normal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old with a history of Raynaud's disease, no significant heart or lung history, presenting with intermittent fevers and fatigue for three weeks. The patient has been diagnosed with babesiosis, as confirmed by a positive parasite smear and recent tick exposure. There are also signs of new onset anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are consistent with babesiosis. The patient's prolonged viral illness is less likely given the prolonged time course. There is a possibility of pneumonia, but the chest X-ray suggests effusions with edema rather than an infiltrate.

The patient is currently on atovaquone and azithromycin for babesiosis and appears clinically stable. If the patient worsens, consideration will be given to switching antibiotics to clindamycin-quinine. Hemolytic and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs will be trended. A follow-up chest X-ray will also be done.

The patient developed pulmonary edema in the setting of intravenous fluids and new onset atrial fibrillation (PAF). The patient reports leg edema prior to diuresis and has a history of valvulopathy. The patient's clinical improvement may correlate with the return to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Diuretics have been held due to decreased oxygen requirement.

ARDS is possible in babesiosis, but the patient has other signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) and minimal oxygen requirement,"

 BABESIOSIS
   This is a  78 y/o with Raynoulds, no significant heart or lung history
   presents from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 608**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with intermittent fevers and fatigue for
   3 weeks and parasite smear + for babesiosis by report and SOB
   # Fevers, maliase: per report parasite smear at [**Hospital1 608**] positive for
   babesiosis. Fatigue, fevers, consistent with Babesiosis, as is recent
   tick exposure. New onset anemia and thrombocytopenia also consistent.
   Prolonged viral illness possible but becoming less likely given
   prolonged time cause.  ? infiltrate on CXR raising ? of new PNA in
   addition given presistent fevver, however on CXR more likely effusions
   with edema
   - Continue Atovoquone and Azithro for Babesiosis as apears clinically
   stable on arrival.
   - consider switch Abx to Clindamycin-quinine if clinically worsens
   - f/u Hemolytic, DIC labs
   - Trend CXR
   - Per ID restarted doxycycline yesterday to cover for lyme.
   - F/U ID recs.
   #  Pulmonary edema: developed in setting of IVF and new onset PAF. Pt
   reports LE edema prior to diuresis. Likely [**2-8**] CHF given lung findings,
   elevated JVP, h/o valvulopathy, and new onset arrthymia. Diuresed well
   with lasix. Clinical improvement may correlate with return to NSR.
   ARDS possible in babesiosis. however pt with other signs of CHF and pt
   with minimal oxygen requirement making ARDS unlikely.
   - hold diuresis given decreased oxygen requirement
   - f/u final CXR read
   - nebs
   - echo today showed moderate Aortic Regurg.
   #  Hyponatremia. Resolving with Na 126 today with fluid restrictions.
   Exam consistent with hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urine NA > 60,
   suggesting against CHF as etiology but difficult to inerperate in
   setting of recent diuresis. SIADH also possible in setting of possible
   lung infection.
   - Given downtrending in setting of diruesis hold lasix
   - fluid restrict
   - trend NA
   # PAF: New onset Afib [**7-21**]. Now in NSR. Was on lovenox but d/ced.
   - ASA 81mg
   - trend INR
   - continue metopolol
   - hold dig for now, check level given combination of azithro and dig
   - given now resolved and in setting of infection, will stop
   anticoagulation
   #  Anemia:  HCT of 27, down from baseline of 40. NO obvious GI bleed.
   Could be [**2-8**] hemolysis in setting of babesiosis.  LDH slightly elevated
   but tbili normal.
   - Trend HCT
   - Transfuse if < 21

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of Reynolds, no significant heart or lung history, presenting with intermittent fevers and fatigue for 3 weeks. He has been diagnosed with babesiosis, as indicated by a positive parasite smear and recent tick exposure. The patient also has new-onset anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are consistent with babesiosis. There is a possibility of pulmonary edema due to IVF and new-onset PAF. The patient reports lower extremity edema prior to diuresis, and there is a history of valvulopathy. The patient has been diuresed well with lasix and shows clinical improvement with a return to normal sinus rhythm. 

Other potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is resolving with sodium levels trending up today. This could be due to hypervolemic hyponatremia or SIADH. Fluid restrictions have been implemented, and lasix has been held.

2. PAF (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension): The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which is now resolved and in normal sinus rhythm. ASA, metoprolol, and INR are being trended. Digoxin has been held due to the combination of azithromycin and digoxin, and anticoagulation has been stopped since the patient is now resolved and"

","The patient is a 73-year-old female admitted with babesiosis. She has been treated with atovaquone and azithromycin for babesiosis, and she is now on doxycycline due to the high prevalence of co-existent tick-borne illnesses. The patient's condition has improved since admission, with a reduction in fever and improvement in her blood pressure. However, she continues to have mild to moderate pulmonary edema, which is believed to be cardiac in origin. Her atrial fibrillation has remained in normal sinus rhythm since being in the ICU and she will continue on metoprolol. The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder remains unchanged, and she will continue with fluid restriction. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of pulmonary edema: The patient still has mild to moderate pulmonary edema, which could potentially worsen if not properly managed.
2. Development of new cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation has improved while in the ICU, but there is still a risk for the development of new cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia remains unchanged, and if not managed properly, it could lead to complications such as seizures or neurological dysfunction.
4. Infection: As the patient is immunocompromised due to babesiosis, there is a risk of developing new infections while in the ICU.
5. Thrombotic events: The"
