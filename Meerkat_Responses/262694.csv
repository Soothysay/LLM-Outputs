","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and chills. He has been experiencing body aches and myalgias. The patient has no known drug allergies. He was started on levophed for decreasing SvO2 and eventually MAPs in the 50s. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, diaphoresis, poor dentition, and crackles at the lung bases. The patient has absent pulses in both radial and distal pulses. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated sodium, low potassium, low magnesium, low phosphate, and normal glucose levels. Imaging reveals no abnormalities. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently receiving ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis Progression: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a confirmed gram-negative sepsis following a prostate biopsy. He presented with fever, chills, and body aches. His vital signs include a temperature of 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate in the range of 65-97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 72/40 to 137/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. He has a history of depression and is currently on Wellbutrin. There is also a mention of possible Brugada syndrome, but no family history of sudden cardiac death. 

The patient's flow sheet data shows an elevated maximum temperature of 40.2 degrees Celsius and current temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius. His blood pressure is mostly within the lower range, and he has a low central venous pressure (CVP). The patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products, resulting in a total fluid balance of 6,660 mL with an output of 5,080 mL. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include the patient being well-nourished but diaphoretic, with poor dentition. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and his peripheral vascular examination"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with gram-negative sepsis following a prostate biopsy. He has been treated with antibiotics, including gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He continues to have a fever and feels better than the previous night. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/62 to 137/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.05 mcg/kg/min for hemodynamic support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent fever: The patient's temperature remains elevated, indicating that the infection may not have been fully controlled yet.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be a sign of septic shock.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, which could be due to fever or sepsis.
4. Decreased SvO2: The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is low at 67%, indicating poor tissue perfusion.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, resulting in a positive fluid balance. This could lead to fluid overload and complications such as pulmonary edema.
6. Renal dysfunction:"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old man admitted to the ICU with urosepsis following a prostate biopsy. He was initially treated with fluids and antibiotics in the emergency department, but his blood pressure continued to fall, and he required the use of Levophed. The patient's urine culture showed growth of Gram-negative rods, and he was switched to Zosyn/Gentamicin. The patient developed multi-lumen, fever, and an increase in blood pressure.

His vital signs include a temperature of 104.4 F, blood pressure ranging from 68-137 mmHg, heart rate between 65-97 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.03 mcg/kg/min and has been receiving prophylactic heparin sodium.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. The flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid resuscitation with IV fluids and blood products. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, with ABG results showing pH, PaCO2, and HCO3- levels at 22, 45, and 18 mmol/L, respectively.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, anxious, and diaphoretic patient with crackles at the lung bases. Cardiovascular examination is normal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of urosepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He was weaned off levophed but experienced dyspnea and pulmonary edema, which improved with IV lasix. The patient's GNR was found to be resistant to gentamicin, so he was switched to meropenem. The patient has no known drug allergies. His allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications are noted. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and dysuria.

24-hour events include blood cultures being drawn multiple times, an EKG, and an episode of dyspnea with suspected pulmonary edema treated with IV lasix. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, except for a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a low central venous pressure (CVP) and low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). The patient has received a significant amount of fluid and blood products, resulting in a negative fluid balance. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, and the patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 97%.

Physical examination findings include poor dentition and endotracheal tube placement, symmetric chest expansion with fine crackles at the lung bases bilaterally, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's int"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis following a recent prostate biopsy. He was admitted to the ICU for sepsis and is now showing signs of improvement. However, he continues to have persistent fever and has developed pulmonary edema, which improved with the administration of Lasix. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/64-86/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results indicate a slightly elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient initially presented with urosepsis after the prostate biopsy, which is a serious infection that can occur as a result of the procedure. It is important to closely monitor his vital signs and laboratory parameters to ensure that the infection is being appropriately managed.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has developed pulmonary edema, as indicated by the presence of crackles on lung auscultation and the chest X-ray showing clear lung fields. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and prompt treatment with diuretics and other supportive measures are necessary.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with urosepsis after a recent prostate biopsy. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis. The patient has been weaned off pressors overnight and has shown improvement in his condition. However, he still has episodes of dyspnea and pulmonary edema, which have been treated with Lasix.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8°F, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/64 mmHg to 130/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 74%, and he has received a total of 3,172 mL of fluids since midnight with a balance of -4,128 mL.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 34%, platelet count (Plt) of 167 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 112 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 124 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels below 0.01 ng/mL. Imaging reveals new pulmonary edema but relatively clear chest X-ray (CXR) angles bilaterally.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is no longer hypotensive and has successfully been weaned from pressors. The patient continues to be febrile, and daily blood cultures are being followed until cleared. His CVP is at goal, but fluid/pressor support will be provided as necessary. Tight glycemic control below 150 mg/dL with insulin sensitivity scoring (ISS) is recommended.

The patient also presents with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and large clots, which are being evaluated for potential sources of bleeding, including prostate hemorrhage and ischemic bowel. Serial Hct and lactate levels will be monitored. The patient has a history of depression and will continue with his home dose of wellbutrin. There are also concerns regarding possible Brugada syndrome, and cardiology has been called in for further evaluation.

ICU care includes regular diet, glycemic control with rapid-acting insulin sensitivity scoring (RISS), and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his total time spent in the ICU is 40 minutes."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who presented to the ICU with urosepsis following a prostate biopsy. The patient has a history of hypertension. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, but there were concerns about melena (blood in stool) which occurred twice, with the second episode being significant at approximately 300cc. Urology was consulted, but they did not recommend any intervention. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels decreased from 36% to 32%, indicating blood loss. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has been fluctuating, with a low of 4.6 K/uL and a high of 6.2 K/uL. The patient's platelet count (Plt) has been within normal range. Renal function tests show a creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8, indicating some kidney impairment. The patient's troponin-T levels have been consistently low, suggesting no cardiac involvement. Blood glucose levels have been within normal range. The patient's electrolytes show mild hypophosphatemia (low phosphate) and low magnesium levels. The patient's lactic acid and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are elevated, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion or ongoing infection. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT),"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis after undergoing a prostate biopsy. He is currently afebrile and has been successfully weaned off prossors (presumably meaning he is no longer hypotensive). His central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 10. The patient will require at least two weeks of intravenous antibiotics, but potentially longer if there is evidence of a prostate abscess. The patient continues to experience maroon-colored stools, known as BRBPR, which has improved after a manual prostate tamponade. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels remain stable. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count has been fluctuating within normal range. His platelet (Plt) count has also been stable. Creatinine (Cr) levels have been consistently around 0.8, indicating normal kidney function. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well-controlled. Other lab results including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, Lactic Acid, LDH, Calcium (Ca++), Magnesium (Mg++), and Phosphate (PO4) are within normal limits. The patient has a confirmed infection with a Gram-negative organism in his blood culture. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) showed small ST elevations in v1-v2 and right bundle branch block (RBBB), but these findings were not persistent and were not considered concerning for Brugada syndrome. The patient's troponin-T levels have been consistently below 0.01, indicating no cardiac damage. The patient is currently on wellbutrin at home dose for depression. There is no evidence of bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. The patient is expected to be stable for transfer to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis following a recent prostate biopsy. The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and a positive blood culture for Gram-negative rods. He was started on gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam but was switched to meropenem due to the presence of a confirmed GNR infection. The patient's sepsis has since resolved, as indicated by his afebrile status for 24 hours. His blood pressure has stabilized, and he has been successfully weaned off vasopressors. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 10 mmHg.

The patient continues to experience maroon-colored stools (BRBPR), which improved after manual prostate tamponade. His hematocrit (Hct) levels have remained stable. The source of bleeding is believed to be from the prostate biopsy site, and further intervention is not warranted at this time.

Other assessments include ongoing monitoring for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's electrolyte levels and liver function tests are within normal limits.

Plan:
1. Continue with tight glycemic control, maintaining blood glucose levels below 150 mg/dL.
2. Administer IV antibiotics for a minimum of two weeks, or longer if a prostate abs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of urosepsis, rectal bleeding, and recent prostate biopsy. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently showing signs of resolving urosepsis. However, he has experienced two episodes of passing clots rectally and has had a decrease in hematocrit levels from 35 to 32, now at 33.6. The patient denies abdominal pain or rectal pain. His allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has received various antibiotics for his urosepsis, including gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 100/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on sinus rhythm and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,600 mL, output of 4,990 mL, and negative balance of -3,390 mL. He is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, platelet count of 153 K/uL, sodium of 138 mg/dL, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride of 22 mEq/L, magnesium of 0.8 mg/dL, phosphate of 4.6 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 106 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 131 mg/dL, and troponin-T of <0.01 ng/mL. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are 11.4/27.2/0.9, respectively, and other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB): The patient's hematocrit levels have stabilized without transfusions. The source of bleeding may be due to bleeding from the prostate, but it is unclear why he is still bleeding this far out from the procedure. Possible causes include hypophosphatemia, which can cause platelet dysfunction. 
   - Continue to follow serial Hct
   - Maintain IV access, type and cross

2. HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA (LOW PHOSPHATE): The etiology of hypophosphatemia is unclear, with possible causes including poor intake, high intake of calcium with meals, massive volume repletion, vitamin D deficiency, or secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
   - Follow up Vitamin D level,"
