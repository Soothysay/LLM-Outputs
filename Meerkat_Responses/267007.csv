   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure- Pt has atelectasis and decreased lung
   volume from abd pushing up. Started POD#2, with hypoxia on NC. DDx
   includes PE, but CTA is negative and pt is on SQH. Pt may have become
   fluid overloaded s/p 4u PRBC. Pt shows moderate pleural effusions that
   were not present on the CT scan on [**2-22**]. TRALI syndrome also a
   possiblity, which has been known to occur upto 6 hours after blood
   transfusion. Infection unlikely w/o wbc and infiltrate on CT. Pt also
   shows atalectasis that may be contributing.  Pt
s most latest AGB shows
   resp acidosis, so pt may be tiring out. Pt is also becoming
   intermittently confused and shows asterixis.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent a transverse colectomy and is now in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes being in respiratory distress, hypotension, and confusion. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing difficulty in breathing and decreased lung volume due to abdominal distension. This could be caused by atelectasis, pleural effusions, or a possible pulmonary embolism (PE).

2. Fluid overload: The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and showed moderate pleural effusions, indicating the possibility of fluid overload. This could lead to congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.

3. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI): Given the moderate pleural effusions and recent blood transfusion, TRALI syndrome is a possibility. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any worsening respiratory symptoms.

4. Infection: The presence of fever and leukocytosis may indicate an infection. However, the absence of WBCs in the urine and no infiltrate on the CT scan makes infection less likely.

5. Peritonitis and anastomotic leak: The patient's increasing abdominal distension, tenderness, and pneumoperitoneum suggest the possibility of peritonitis and anastomotic leak. Surgical intervention is necessary to address this issue."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent a transverse colectomy and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has a history of emphysema and ethanol abuse. The patient required invasive ventilation and experienced an unplanned extubation. She was reintubated and placed on multi-lumen tubing. The patient developed septic shock, likely secondary to a bowel organism, and is currently being managed with norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This may be due to volume overload and increasing abdominal distention. The patient is oxygenating and ventilating appropriately on current ventilator settings. Regular arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is ongoing.

Additionally, the patient has a history of colorectal cancer, for which she underwent a transverse colectomy. However, she experienced an anastomotic bleed and then a leak, leading to an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, end ileostomy, and Hartmann's procedure.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), and cardiac function uncertainty. Baseline blood pressure is unknown, and cardiac function needs further evaluation. The patient's glycemic control, nutritional status, and prophylactic measures"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent a transverse colectomy, has a history of emphysema and ethanol abuse, and was admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has experienced several significant events including unplanned extubation, invasive ventilation, and septic shock. She is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, vasopressin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluconazole.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 106 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 107/68 mmHg to 115/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 35 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, distended abdomen, and absence of bowel sounds. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 2.2 mmol/L, and decreased albumin level of 1.8 g/dL. The patient's kidney function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is in septic shock likely secondary to a bowel organism. She requires continued administration of norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluconazole) should be continued.
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to volume overload and increasing abdominal distention. Current ventilator settings are appropriate, and ABGs should be monitored every 3 hours. Continue home nebulizers.
3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Colorectal (Colon Cancer): The patient underwent a transverse colectomy and subsequently developed anastomotic bleed and leak, leading to exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, end ileostomy, and Hartmann's procedure. Abdominal distention and hematocrit levels are stable. Follow recommendations from Dr. [Doctor First Name].
4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis and does not suggest cardiogenic shock. Manage as per sepsis management plan.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is worsening, likely"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, emphysema, ethanol abuse, and transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, alcohol abuse, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), peritonitis, respiratory failure, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the colon, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and pain control.

The patient's current condition includes septic shock likely secondary to bowel organisms, right subclavian line placement, minimizing IV fluids due to positive fluid balance, acute respiratory failure occurring in the setting of volume overload and increasing abdominal distention, colon cancer with complications from surgery such as anastomotic bleed and leak, hypotension likely secondary to sepsis, acute renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion, and unknown baseline blood pressure and cardiac function.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/56 to 73/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, levophed, midaz"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, emphysema, ethanol abuse, and transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has multiple medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, alcohol abuse, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), peritonitis, respiratory failure, colorectal cancer, severe sepsis, and pain control.

The patient is currently in septic shock, likely secondary to bowel organisms. She is being managed with vasopressin, vanc, zosyn, and fluconazole for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. The patient also has acute respiratory failure, which is occurring in the setting of volume overload and increasing abdominal distention. Her current oxygenation and ventilation are appropriate on the current ventilator settings.

She underwent a transverse colectomy, c/b anastomotic bleed then leak, followed by an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, end ileostomy, and Hartmann's procedure. Her hemoglobin concentration is stable, and abdominal distention is stable. The patient's cardiac function is unknown, with a baseline blood pressure and cardiac function. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal ejection fraction, so lopressor has been held.

The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are being closely monitored, with a goal of maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, previous abdominal surgery, emphysema, and ethanol abuse. She was transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode, set with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. The patient's oxygenation is being supported with supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 130.5 kg, with a significant increase from her admission weight of 69.2 kg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,670 mL and output of 2,385 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -865 mL. Blood products have been transfused with a total output of 2,535 mL. The patient's urine output has been good at 2,385 mL. No nasogastric tube output or stool has been recorded.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 186 K/uL and leukocyte differential showing neutrophils at 85.0%, bands at 2.0%, lymphocytes at 8.0%, monocytes at 4.0%, eosinophils at 0.0%, and basophils at 0.0%. The platelet count is within normal range at 186 K/uL. Other lab values show normal ranges for hemoglobin, hematocrit, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 96%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 194 mmHg. The respiratory system compliance is 29.4 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals an intubated and sedated patient with bilateral pitting edema at the ankles and hands, distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, and no other significant findings.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has developed ARDS in the setting of volume overload and increasing abdominal distention. She will be placed on pressure support of 18/10 and continue with q8h ABGs. Diuretics with bolus IV lasix will be administered as tolerated, along with q8h electrolyte monitoring. Home nebs"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, pad (likely pacemaker), emphysema, ethanol abuse, and transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, renal failure, alcohol abuse, anemia secondary to blood loss, peritonitis, colorectal cancer, hyperbilirubinemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and unknown cardiac function.
- The patient has shown improvements in her condition, such as stable hemoglobin levels, improved creatinine levels, and resolution of hyponatremia.
- She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support.
- She has a right subclavian line placed and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient's abdominal distention and respiratory distress are being managed with diuretics and other interventions.
- She has a history of colorectal cancer, which led to a transverse colectomy and subsequent anastomotic bleed and leak.
- The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are being closely monitored and managed.
- She is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening of ARDS"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of colon adenocarcinoma who underwent transverse colectomy and developed an anastomotic leak leading to sepsis. The patient also has respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 141/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.6 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 6 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 103 mEq/L, and elevated D-dimer level of 1569 ng/mL. 

The patient's imaging shows fluid overload with bilateral effusions on chest X-ray. 

The assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, alcohol abuse, anemia secondary to blood loss, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), peritonitis, respiratory failure, cancer, severe sepsis, pain control, and others. 

The patient is currently on Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, Fluconazole, and Heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), nosocomial infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and delirium."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, pad emphysema, ethanol abuse, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient experienced erratic breathing patterns with a rate ranging from 20 to 50 breaths per minute and was on pressure support of 12. When the pressure support was turned down to 12, the patient's respiratory rate increased to 40s and she became agitated. She was given a sedative and required assistance, now back on pressure support at 15.

The patient had fluid overload as indicated by negative fluid balance of -496 mL and was given lasix 10 mg IV x1, which was tapered off around 10 pm. Another dose of lasix 20 mg IV x1 was given at 6 am due to ongoing fluid overload.

Swab culture from fluid species grew E. coli and Klebsiella, both of which are pan-sensitive. The patient received various antibiotics including piperacillin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Vital signs showed a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 90 bpm with a range of 77-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72/50 mmHg to 148/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute with a"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent a transverse colectomy and has a history of pad, emphysema, ethanol abuse. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure.

During the night, the patient remained on pressure support ventilation with an erratic breathing pattern and a heart rate ranging from 20 to 50 beats per minute. She had thick white sputum, and a specimen was sent for analysis. The patient was placed on assisted ventilation due to respiratory distress after sedation was given.

The patient experienced episodes of agitation and increased respiratory rate when the pressure support was reduced from 15 to 12 cmH2O. She was given a sedative and required assistance with ventilation.

Fluid management was ongoing, with Lasix being administered to promote diuresis and avoid fluid overload. The patient also received medications such as Piperacillin-Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Fluconazole, Heparin, Famotidine, Furosemide, Midazolam, and Fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/56 to 148/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient was sed"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, previous abdominal surgery, emphysema, and ethanol abuse. She was transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The patient has been experiencing fever, and there are concerns about potential sources of infection such as line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), empyema/abscess, and surgical site infection. The patient's blood cultures have been taken, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, and Fluconazole.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure due to volume overload, anxiety, and metabolic alkalosis. She is unable to be weaned off the ventilator and is receiving diuretic therapy with Furosemide (Lasix) to manage fluid overload.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, which improved after addressing hypoperfusion. She is producing good amounts of urine with diuresis.

There is mention of anemia secondary to blood loss during her recent surgery. Her cancer history includes colorectal cancer for which she underwent a transverse colectomy, followed by an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, end ileostomy, and Hartmann's procedure.

Cardiac function is unknown, and the baseline blood pressure is not specified. An echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction, and the use of Lopressor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, pad, emphysema, and ethanol abuse. She was transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Cultures were obtained from blood, sputum, urine, and wound sites. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and fluconazole. She is also on diuretics for fluid overload and sedation for anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload, anxiety, and metabolic alkalosis. Continuous diuresis with lasix drip and monitoring electrolytes should be continued. Pressure support ventilation and frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis should be implemented. Home nebulizers can be continued as well.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which is not delirium. Improved response to fentanyl suggests opioid-induced sedation. Continuing sedation as needed may be appropriate.

3. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient exhibits signs of sepsis, including fever and hypotension. The source of infection is unclear, with potential causes such as line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), empyema/abscess, or surgical site infection. Broad-s"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent a transverse colectomy, has a history of pad, emphysema, and ethanol abuse, and was transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing fevers, and her blood pressure and heart rate have been stable. The patient had an erythematous central venous line (CVL) that was replaced. Surgical exploration of the surgical site revealed purulent fluid, which was drained. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and diuretics. She is also on mechanical ventilation with pressure support.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. It is crucial to closely monitor her oxygenation levels and adjust ventilator settings accordingly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and the presence of purulent fluid from the surgical site suggest the possibility of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of infection parameters are necessary.
3. Line infection: The erythematous CVL and subsequent replacement indicate a potential line infection. Culturing the line and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be required.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Frequent auscultation of lung sounds, monitoring of oxygenation, and regular bronchoscopies may be needed.

   Microbiology: No new data
   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:
   Chest CT demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions with associated
   compressive atelectasis.
   Continue diuresis (goal 2l) in effort to decrease anasarca and pleural
   effusions.
   Decrease PS to 10 and further if tolerated.
   There is no clear infiltrate on chest CT to suggest pneumonia and she
   does not have significant secretions.
   2) Sepsis:
   Evaluate abd CT for fluid collection.
   F/u cultures.
   If no other source, consider thoracentesis though likelihood of these
   bilateral effusions being infected is extremely low.
   Continue vanco/zosyn for now.
   3) Acid-base:
   Metabolic alkalosis improved with acetazolamide.
   Continue given persistent alkalemia which will decrease respiratory
   drive.
   4) Altered mental status:
   F/u head CT.
   Avoid continuous IV sedatives and allow to awaken.
   5) Anemia:
   Hct has been stable.  No evidence of blood loss--continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of colon cancer who underwent hemicolectomy and is now experiencing sepsis and respiratory failure. She is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, and vancomycin. Her vital signs show fever, low blood pressure, and tachycardia. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. She has bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, as seen on a chest CT scan. Lab results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's mental status is altered, and she is at risk for blood clots and stress ulcers. She is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Measures are in place to improve oxygenation and ventilation, but continuous monitoring is necessary.
2. Sepsis: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition suggests ongoing infection. Cultures are being evaluated, and additional interventions may be required to control the infection.
3. Pleural Effusions: The bilateral pleural effusions can potentially lead to respiratory compromise if they continue to accumulate. Efforts are being made"

   Imaging: Chest CT:  b/l pleural effusion with associated compressive

   Microbiology: No new data
   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:
   Chest CT demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions with associated
   compressive atelectasis.
   Continue diuresis (goal 2l) in effort to decrease anasarca and pleural
   effusions.
   Decrease PS to 10 and further if tolerated.
   There is no clear infiltrate on chest CT to suggest pneumonia and she
   does not have significant secretions.
   2) Sepsis:
   Evaluate abd CT for fluid collection.
   F/u cultures.
   If no other source, consider thoracentesis though likelihood of these
   bilateral effusions being infected is extremely low.
   Continue vanco/zosyn for now.
   3) Acid-base:
   Metabolic alkalosis improved with acetazolamide.
   Continue given persistent alkalemia which will decrease respiratory
   drive.
   4) Altered mental status:
   F/u head CT.
   Avoid continuous IV sedatives and allow to awaken.
   5) Anemia:
   Hct has been stable.  No evidence of blood loss--continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of colon cancer who underwent hemicolectomy due to bleeding and peritonitis. She is currently in the ICU for sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate ranging from 75-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72-108/42-52 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her weight has increased from 69.2 kg at admission to 128 kg currently.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including diuretics, H2 blockers, heparin sodium, fentanyl, and others. She is also receiving tube feeds and has an OG/NG tube in place.

Fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring show positive fluid intake and output with a net balance of -1,855 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated lactate level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2158-3-14**] 04:15 PM
 FEVER - 103.5
F - [**2158-3-15**] 04:00 AM
   - Around 4pm pt became febrile to  101.2  and tachycardic to 120s
   (previously never tachycardic). Also RR increased to 40s.  Surgery
   wanted to try Precedex, started.
   - Pt
s ABG prior to this (in am) was 7.46 / 43/ 96 / 32, and the new
   abg at 5pm was similar 7.45 / 37 /  81 / 27
 but pt
s minute
   venilation was significantly increased from then and would expect pC02
   lower
 suggesting incr dead spacing, and pt was concerning for PE.
   - Pt
s  pressure support was inc to 25 w/o benefit on RR,
   - Pt
s 02 sat dropped to 90%, and pt
s Fi02 was increased from 40 to
   70% and started back on AC Vt 450, fio2 70, peep 8, RR 32.  Given
   hypoxia and tachycardia w/ new dead spacing decision was made to
   attempt CTA for PE.
   - Also around this time from pt
s lasix gtt she was already -2L,. Also
   considered pt
s tachycardia.
   - new CXR showed no new infiltrates and was unchanged.
   - LENI was negative
   - blood cx sent, more tylenol given
   - Pt was to get 25g albumin, but surgery decided to give 2 u PRBC
   instead, hct stable at 25 at the time.
   - Around 6pm
s WBC increased from 13 earlier that day to 24 (Hct
   stable at 25.4) Cdiff was sent. And a new lactate was sent and was 4.1
   - Spoke to surgery about expanding abx
 agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV
   q8, and surgery contd to want to r/o PE
   - bladder pressure 19 - stable
   - Pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s, map 40s, and gave 1L bolus, w/
   1unit PRBC being transfused during that time. Pt still required
   levophed 0.3, and then added vasopresin 1.2 then 2.4.
   - Pt
s map stabalized > 65 lactate came down to 3.8, pt went to CT ->
   CTA neg prelim read. Pt weaned from levophed.
   - Pt stayed stable until 4am, fever of 103.5, new blood cx sent.
   Lactate back to 4.0 restarted on levophed, now 0.12, and vasopresin
   2.4, map stable , at 7am lactate 3.8

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma who underwent right hemi-colectomy on POD #13 due to anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status (AMS). She then underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of the [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch on POD #9, and currently experiences respiratory failure.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has had several significant events. She became febrile to 103.5 and tachycardic to 120s, with an increased respiratory rate of 40s. An arterial blood gas (ABG) prior to this showed a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 43, PaO2 of 96, and HCO3 of 32. A new ABG at 5pm showed a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 37, PaO2 of 81, and HCO3 of 27. The patient's minute ventilation was significantly increased, suggesting increased dead space, and she was concerning for pulmonary embolism (PE). Pressure support was increased to 25 without benefit on respiratory rate, and the patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 90%. The FiO2 was increased from 40 to 70%, and the ventilator settings were adjusted to assist control mode. Given the hypoxia and tachycardia with new dead spacing, a decision was made to attempt computed tomography angiography (CTA) for PE. Additionally, the patient's fluid status was assessed, with a total fluid intake of 6,533 mL and output of 6,072 mL.

The patient's laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.1, elevated lactate levels at 4.0 mmol/L, and elevated D-dimer levels at 1569 ng/mL. Blood cultures were negative on two occasions. The patient's abdominal examination was stable, but the gallbladder's total bilirubin was rising, which could suggest acute cholecystitis in critically ill patients.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, vasopressin, norepinephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), fluconazole, vancomycin, piperacillin, metronidazole, insulin, midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl.

The patient's physical examination revealed a normocephalic, atraumatic head with no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. The neck was supple, and there were no jugulo-diagastric bulges. The cardiac examination showed a regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds. The lungs were clear bil"

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2158-3-14**] 04:15 PM
 FEVER - 103.5
F - [**2158-3-15**] 04:00 AM
   - Around 4pm pt became febrile to  101.2  and tachycardic to 120s
   (previously never tachycardic). Also RR increased to 40s.  Surgery
   wanted to try Precedex, started.
   - Pt
s ABG prior to this (in am) was 7.46 / 43/ 96 / 32, and the new
   abg at 5pm was similar 7.45 / 37 /  81 / 27
 but pt
s minute
   venilation was significantly increased from then and would expect pC02
   lower
 suggesting incr dead spacing, and pt was concerning for PE.
   - Pt
s  pressure support was inc to 25 w/o benefit on RR,
   - Pt
s 02 sat dropped to 90%, and pt
s Fi02 was increased from 40 to
   70% and started back on AC Vt 450, fio2 70, peep 8, RR 32.  Given
   hypoxia and tachycardia w/ new dead spacing decision was made to
   attempt CTA for PE.
   - Also around this time from pt
s lasix gtt she was already -2L,. Also
   considered pt
s tachycardia.
   - blood cx sent, more tylenol given
   - Pt was to get 25g albumin, but surgery decided to give 2 u PRBC
   instead, hct stable at 25 at the time.
   - Around 6pm
s WBC increased from 13 earlier that day to 24 (Hct
   stable at 25.4) Cdiff was sent. And a new lactate was sent and was 4.1
   - Spoke to surgery about expanding abx
 agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV
   q8, and surgery contd to want to r/o PE
   - Pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s, map 40s, and gave 1L bolus, w/
   1unit PRBC being transfused during that time. Pt still required
   levophed 0.3, and then added vasopresin 1.2 then 2.4.
   - Pt
s map stabalized > 65 lactate came down to 3.8, pt went to CT ->
   CTA neg prelim read. Pt weaned from levophed.
   - Pt stayed stable until 4am, fever of 103.5, new blood cx sent.
   Lactate back to 4.0 restarted on levophed, now 0.12, and vasopresin
   2.4, map stable , at 7am lactate 3.8

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])- Has occurred in the
   setting of volume overload and anxiety. Unable to wean at this point,
   likely due to fluid overload (effusion and edema), abdominal distension
   and metabolic alkalosis.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, pad, emphysema, and ethanol abuse. She was transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, and hypoxemia. 

On the 24-hour timeline:
- The patient became febrile around 4 pm and tachycardic with a heart rate of 120s. The respiratory rate also increased to 40s.
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) prior to this showed a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 43, PaO2 of 96, and HCO3- of 32. A new ABG at 5 pm showed a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 37, PaO2 of 81, and HCO3- of 27. The patient's minute ventilation was significantly increased, indicating increased dead space, and there were concerns of pulmonary embolism (PE).
- Pressure support was increased to 25 without benefit on respiratory rate, and the patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 90%. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was increased from 40% to 70%, and the assisted ventilation mode was started back on with settings of AC Vt 450, FiO2 70, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8, and respiratory rate (RR) 32. Given the hypoxia, tachycardia, and new dead space, a decision was made to attempt computed tomography angiography (CTA) for PE.
- From the patient's Lasix group, she was already -2 liters. It was also considered that the patient's tachycardia might be due to hypovolemia.
- Blood cultures were sent, and more Tylenol was given.
- The patient was to receive 25% albumin, but surgery decided to give 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) instead, with a hematocrit (Hct) stable at 25.4.
- Around 6 pm, the white blood cell (WBC) count increased from 13 to 24. A C. difficile test was sent, as well as a new lactate level of 4.1.
- Spoke to surgery about expanding antibiotic coverage and agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV every 8 hours. Surgery continued to want to rule out PE.
- The patient became hypotensive to systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 70s and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 40s. A 1-liter bolus was given, and 1 unit of PRBCs was transfused during that time. The patient still required dopamine at a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/min, and then vasopressin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, pad, emphysema, ethanol abuse, and transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. The patient's respiratory support plan includes continuing diuresis with Lasix, switching to pressure support, and conducting regular arterial blood gas (ABG) analyses.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile since the evening of the third day and has tachycardia and tachypnea. The source of infection is unclear but could potentially be a line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), empyema/abscess, or surgical site infection. The treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluconazole), re-siting the central venous line, mini-balloon aspiration for culture data, tapping effusions if sufficient on ultrasound, and surgical intervention for the surgical site.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level improved, indicating that the"

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2158-3-14**] 04:15 PM
 FEVER - 103.5
F - [**2158-3-15**] 04:00 AM
   - Around 4pm pt became febrile to  101.2  and tachycardic to 120s
   (previously never tachycardic). Also RR increased to 40s.  Surgery
   wanted to try Precedex, started.
   - Pt
s ABG prior to this (in am) was 7.46 / 43/ 96 / 32, and the new
   abg at 5pm was similar 7.45 / 37 /  81 / 27
 but pt
s minute
   venilation was significantly increased from then and would expect pC02
   lower
 suggesting incr dead spacing, and pt was concerning for PE.
   - Pt
s  pressure support was inc to 25 w/o benefit on RR,
   - Pt
s 02 sat dropped to 90%, and pt
s Fi02 was increased from 40 to
   70% and started back on AC Vt 450, fio2 70, peep 8, RR 32.  Given
   hypoxia and tachycardia w/ new dead spacing decision was made to
   attempt CTA for PE.
   - Also around this time from pt
s lasix gtt she was already -2L,. Also
   considered pt
s tachycardia.
   - new CXR showed no new infiltrates and was unchanged.
   - LENI was negative
   - blood cx sent, more tylenol given
   - Pt was to get 25g albumin, but surgery decided to give 2 u PRBC
   instead, hct stable at 25 at the time.
   - Around 6pm
s WBC increased from 13 earlier that day to 24 (Hct
   stable at 25.4) Cdiff was sent. And a new lactate was sent and was 4.1
   - Spoke to surgery about expanding abx
 agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV
   q8, and surgery contd to want to r/o PE
   - bladder pressure 19 - stable
   - Pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s, map 40s, and gave 1L bolus, w/
   1unit PRBC being transfused during that time. Pt still required
   levophed 0.3, and then added vasopresin 1.2 then 2.4.
   - Pt
s map stabalized > 65 lactate came down to 3.8, pt went to CT ->
   CTA neg prelim read. Pt weaned from levophed.
   - Pt stayed stable until 4am, fever of 103.5, new blood cx sent.
   Lactate back to 4.0 restarted on levophed, now 0.12, and vasopresin
   2.4, map stable , at 7am lactate 3.8

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma who has undergone several surgeries including right hemi-colectomy, exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has developed sepsis with an unclear source. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, acute renal failure, anemia due to blood loss, and malignancy. Her cardiac function is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and has been febrile for several days without a clear source of infection. The most likely source of infection is the abdomen, possibly due to an abscess or cholecystitis. Other potential sources include line infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or empyema.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to volume overload, anxiety, and metabolic alkalosis. She is unable to wean off the ventilator and requires pressure support.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to sedation or sepsis. She is responsive to noxious stimuli but not fully awake.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure, but"

   transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])- Has occurred in the
   setting of volume overload and anxiety. Unable to wean at this point,
   likely due to fluid overload (effusion and edema), abdominal distension
   and metabolic alkalosis.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix drip and monitoring [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   - switch to pressure support and continue q8h ABGs
   - continue home nebs
   - continue sedation prn
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)- had previously been on versed
   boluses
   - improved on  fentanyl drip
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION,  [**1-30**] PERITONITIS (NON-SBP)  -
   hypotension now resolved,  off pressors but continues to have fevers.
   Source unclear, potentially could be line infection (erythema at CVL),
   VAP,  empyema/abscess, surgical site. Per surgery, too early for
   abdominal fluid collection.
   - Continue vanc, zosyn and fluconazole for broad spectrum abx coverage
   - will resite line after discussing with surgery
   - mini BAL for culture data
   - potentially tap effusions if sufficient on US.
   - f/u differential

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, pad emphysema, ethanol abuse, and transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are signs of sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but potential sources include line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), empyema/abscess, or surgical site infection. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to fluid overload, anxiety, and metabolic alkalosis. She has acute renal failure secondary to hypoperfusion, but her creatinine levels have improved. The patient also has anemia secondary to blood loss during surgery. 

The patient has a history of colorectal cancer and has undergone a transverse colectomy with complications such as anastomotic bleed and leak, followed by exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, end ileostomy, and Hartmann's procedure. Her cardiac function is unknown, and her baseline blood pressure is unclear. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal ejection fraction, and lopressor (a beta-blocker) has been held.

The patient's nutritional support includes enteral feeding with fiber supplementation, thiamine, folate, and an increased goal of 80 mL/hr. Glycemic control is being maintained. The"

   - Around 4pm pt became febrile to  101.2  and tachycardic to 120s
   (previously never tachycardic). Also RR increased to 40s.  Surgery
   wanted to try Precedex, started.
   - Pt
s ABG prior to this (in am) was 7.46 / 43/ 96 / 32, and the new
   abg at 5pm was similar 7.45 / 37 /  81 / 27
 but pt
s minute
   venilation was significantly increased from then and would expect pC02
   lower
 suggesting incr dead spacing, and pt was concerning for PE.
   - Pt
s  pressure support was inc to 25 w/o benefit on RR,
   - Pt
s 02 sat dropped to 90%, and pt
s Fi02 was increased from 40 to
   70% and started back on AC Vt 450, fio2 70, peep 8, RR 32.  Given
   hypoxia and tachycardia w/ new dead spacing decision was made to
   attempt CTA for PE.
   - Also around this time from pt
s lasix gtt she was already -2L,. Also
   considered pt
s tachycardia.
   - new CXR showed no new infiltrates and was unchanged.
   - LENI was negative
   - blood cx sent, more tylenol given
   - Pt was to get 25g albumin, but surgery decided to give 2 u PRBC
   instead, hct stable at 25 at the time.
   - Around 6pm
s WBC increased from 13 earlier that day to 24 (Hct
   stable at 25.4) Cdiff was sent. And a new lactate was sent and was 4.1
   - Spoke to surgery about expanding abx
 agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV
   q8, and surgery contd to want to r/o PE
   - bladder pressure 19 - stable
   - Pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s, map 40s, and gave 1L bolus, w/
   1unit PRBC being transfused during that time. Pt still required
   levophed 0.3, and then added vasopresin 1.2 then 2.4.
   - Pt
s map stabalized > 65 lactate came down to 3.8, pt went to CT ->
   CTA neg prelim read. Pt weaned from levophed.
   - Pt stayed stable until 4am, fever of 103.5, new blood cx sent.
   Lactate back to 4.0 restarted on levophed, now 0.12, and vasopresin
   2.4, map stable , at 7am lactate 3.8

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma. She has undergone several surgeries including right hemicolectomy, exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria being met four times overnight. Blood cultures have been negative on multiple occasions. The source of infection is most likely from the abdomen. The patient has been prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further investigations are planned to identify the source of infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely due to volume overload, anxiety, abdominal distension, and metabolic alkalosis. Diuretic therapy and monitoring of electrolytes are ongoing. Pressure support and frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis will continue.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which is not due to delirium. Sedation as needed will be continued.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, indicating that acute renal failure was likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Good urine output has been maintained with diuretic therapy.

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2158-3-14**] 04:15 PM
 FEVER - 103.5
F - [**2158-3-15**] 04:00 AM
   - Around 4pm pt became febrile to  101.2  and tachycardic to 120s
   (previously never tachycardic). Also RR increased to 40s.  Surgery
   wanted to try Precedex, started.
   - Pt
s ABG prior to this (in am) was 7.46 / 43/ 96 / 32, and the new
   abg at 5pm was similar 7.45 / 37 /  81 / 27
 but pt
s minute
   venilation was significantly increased from then and would expect pC02
   lower
 suggesting incr dead spacing, and pt was concerning for PE.
   - Pt
s  pressure support was inc to 25 w/o benefit on RR,
   - Pt
s 02 sat dropped to 90%, and pt
s Fi02 was increased from 40 to
   70% and started back on AC Vt 450, fio2 70, peep 8, RR 32.  Given
   hypoxia and tachycardia w/ new dead spacing decision was made to
   attempt CTA for PE.
   - Also around this time from pt
s lasix gtt she was already -2L,. Also
   considered pt
s tachycardia.
   - new CXR showed no new infiltrates and was unchanged.
   - LENI was negative
   - blood cx sent, more tylenol given
   - Pt was to get 25g albumin, but surgery decided to give 2 u PRBC
   instead, hct stable at 25 at the time.
   - Around 6pm
s WBC increased from 13 earlier that day to 24 (Hct
   stable at 25.4) Cdiff was sent. And a new lactate was sent and was 4.1
   - Spoke to surgery about expanding abx
 agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV
   q8, and surgery contd to want to r/o PE
   - bladder pressure 19 - stable
   - Pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s, map 40s, and gave 1L bolus, w/
   1unit PRBC being transfused during that time. Pt still required
   levophed 0.3, and then added vasopresin 1.2 then 2.4.
   - Pt
s map stabalized > 65 lactate came down to 3.8, pt went to CT ->
   CTA neg prelim read. Pt weaned from levophed.
   - Pt stayed stable until 4am, fever of 103.5, new blood cx sent.
   Lactate back to 4.0 restarted on levophed, now 0.12, and vasopresin
   2.4, map stable , at 7am lactate 3.8

","Summary:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of transverse colectomy, pad, emphysema, ethanol abuse, and transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- She developed fever, tachycardia, and increased respiratory rate, indicating possible infection or sepsis.
- The patient's ABG results showed a pH of 7.46/7.45, indicating respiratory alkalosis.
- She required increased ventilatory support and showed signs of potential pulmonary embolism (PE).
- A CT angiography (CTA) was performed to rule out PE, but it was negative.
- The patient's blood cultures were negative on two occasions.
- She had a significant drop in oxygen saturation and required increased FiO2.
- Her lactate levels were elevated, suggesting possible tissue hypoperfusion.
- She became hypotensive and required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
- An ultrasound (US) showed no free fluid in the abdomen.
- The patient's WBC count increased from 13 to 24, indicating a possible infection.
- Her creatinine level improved, indicating improvement in renal function.
- She had acute anemia secondary to blood loss during surgery.
- The patient has a history of colorectal cancer for which she underwent a transverse colectomy.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemicolectomy on postoperative day (POD) #13, complicated by anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and acute mental status changes (AMS), and now status post exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch on POD #9, and respiratory failure.

The patient met the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria overnight without a source of infection identified through blood cultures. The most likely source of infection is from the abdomen. The patient had a CT abdomen that surgery believes is not consistent with abscess, but radiology read suggesting areas of loculation, and although no rim enhancement to suggest abscess, may be early on scan, abdominal exam stable, and bladder pressure is stable currently.

Other potential causes of infection include pulmonary, as the chest X-ray does not show new infiltrates, but pleural effusions continue to be simple in appearance. The central line was changed 2 days ago to the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and is unlikely, but the arterial line over 1 week old, peripheral intravenous (PIV) will be taken out as it is not working well with the patient's anasarca; gallbladder is tending to bilious fluid. The wound site is requiring incision and drainage over the last 2 days with purulent drainage; fungal infection in the abdomen as fluconazole was taken off 2 days ago prior to the patient worsening but very unlikely given the patient is not immunocompromised.

The patient has been given 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) overnight as colloid replacement due to the patient being very volume overloaded overall since admission. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable at 25%, likely dilutional given the 2.5 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) still given overnight.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to intubation, on assist-control (AC) now. The patient became tachypneic likely in the setting of sepsis and transitioned over to assist-control. The patient's pleural effusions and compression atelectasis also contributed. With the new CT angiography (CTA) negative, pulmonary embolism (PE) is unlikely to be contributing to the patient's increased dead space.

The patient's acute mental status changes (AMS) are more alert than previously, still not following commands to extremities. Out of the window of ethanol withdrawal, likely delirium and AMS due to sepsis.

The patient's cardiac function is normal, as the patient had a normal ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiogram in the past. The patient did become hypotensive and may have"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma who underwent a right hemi-colectomy on POD #13 due to an anastomotic leak and peritonitis. She then underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy with [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch on POD #11. The patient also has respiratory failure. Her current condition includes leukocytosis and fever of unknown etiology, as well as concerns for retrocardiac infiltrate on chest X-ray and free air near Hartmann's pouch on CT abdomen, suggesting a possible leakage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis, including fever, leukocytosis, and positive culture of peritoneal fluid growing Gram-negative rods. This could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted control due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia or paraneoplastic syndrome contributing to her respiratory distress.
3. Anastomotic Leak: The presence of free air near Hartmann's pouch on CT abdomen suggests a possible anastomotic leak. This can lead to peritonitis and sepsis.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has received a significant amount of contrast,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma. She underwent right hemi-colectomy on POD #13 due to anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status. She then underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of a [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient's course has been complicated by leukocytosis and fever of unknown etiology. 

24-hour events include an arterial line stoppage, unsuccessful attempts to remove the arterial line, reintubation, and administration of various medications such as Haldol, fentanyl, lasix, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has significant pleural effusions contributing to her tachypnea. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Leukocytosis/Fever of Unknown Etiology: Improved with antibiotics and drainage of localized peritoneal fluid and gallbladder.
2. Respiratory Failure: Restarted on assisted controlled ventilation due to sepsis, now with pressure support 15/8. Significant pleural effusions likely contributing to the patient's tachypnea.
3. AMS: Patient is alert today, making intentional movements to pull out the vent. Will try Haldol prn for agitation.
4. Anemia: Stable.
5. Renal Function: Resolved.
6. FEN: Restarted tube feeds at 20 mL/hour, goal 50; holding tonight in anticipation of surgery. Sliding scale for lytes, and replete IVF prn.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anastomotic leak with free air near the [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch.
2. Respiratory failure due to pleural effusions.
3. Fever of unknown etiology.
4. Leukocytosis.
5. Altered mental status.
6. Potential renal dysfunction due to large contrast exposure.
7. Potential pulmonary embolism.
8. Infection due to indwelling lines.
9. Malnutrition due to limited oral intake.
10. Deep vein thrombosis."

   - Initially decreased pt's PEEP and pressure support. Surgery wanted pt
   on Precedex - later that day around 1pm surgery decided to extubate pt.
   Pt's tolerated extuabtion for 45min, then pt's 02 sat began to drop ->
   90%, cpap and neb did not help -> reintubated and put on AC.
   - Many attempts to get a-line unsuccesful, surgery even tried
   - ID: narrow abx when sensitivies return to cipro/flagyl or ctx/flagyl
   - Haldol prn started, continuing fentanyl
   - standing nebs put on

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 54-year-old female patient with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma.
- The patient underwent right hemi-colectomy on POD #14 due to anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status.
- She then underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch on POD #12.
- The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and requires assisted ventilation.
- Other complications include tachypnea, tachycardia, leukocytosis, fever of unknown etiology, hypervolemia, anemia, acute renal failure, and feeding intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and requires assisted ventilation. There is a potential risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Tachypnea and Tachycardia: The patient is exhibiting signs of tachypnea and tachycardia. These symptoms may indicate worsening agitation or underlying sepsis.
3. Leukocytosis and Fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever of unknown etiology. This could be indicative of an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Hypervolemia: The patient is fluid overloaded, which can lead to complications such"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient was extubated yesterday but had to be re-intubated due to respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. The patient is agitated and attempting to clear pleural effusions by diuresis.

The patient has a history of colon cancer and underwent resection. They are currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for peritonitis. The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss and is being closely monitored.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/80 mmHg to 148/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L, hyponatremia with sodium levels between 124 and 132 mEq/L, and low albumin level of 2.0 g/dL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and severe, requiring mechanical ventilation. The failure to wean off the ventilator suggests the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other complications such as ARDS.

2. Sepsis: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected peritonitis. The presence of sepsis increases the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and septic shock.

3. Acute Anemia: The patient's acute anemia is secondary to blood loss, which may require transfusion support. However, transfusion-related complications like transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) or allergic reactions should be considered.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at high risk for developing DVT due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin and compression boots, are in place to reduce the risk.

5. Cancer Recurrence: The patient has a history of colon cancer, and there is a possibility of cancer recurrence or metastasis. Monitoring for any signs or symptoms of cancer progression is essential.

6. Complications from Surgery: The patient underwent resection for colon cancer. Potential postoperative complications, such as wound infection or abscess, should be monitored for.

7. Medication Reactions: The patient is on multiple medications,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, sepsis, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory distress and hypoxemia. They are also experiencing agitation and attempting to clear pleural effusions through diuresis.

The patient's history is significant for colorectal cancer, for which they underwent a resection. They have been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected peritonitis. Their vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxemia. They have a fever and increased white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection.

The patient's lab results indicate acute anemia secondary to blood loss, electrolyte imbalances, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The blood cultures have been sent, and they are being treated empirically for sepsis.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including analgesics, sedatives, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. They are also receiving nutritional support through a feeding tube.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they require ongoing ventilatory support. They have diminished breath sounds on the chest examination, and there is evidence of fluid overload as seen in the flow sheet data.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and they require close monitoring and aggressive management of their multiple medical complications."

She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and other complications.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. She has a low respiratory system compliance and is at risk of further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma. A non-contrast CT scan of the chest is needed to check for any drainable collections. The patient may require increased PEEP with colloid or pressors to improve oxygenation and lung recruitment. A pressure support trial can be considered after adjusting her lung status. 
2. Agitation: The patient is agitated but better controlled on a propofol drip. However, this medication causes hypotension. 
3. Leukocytosis/Fevers: The patient's fever has improved with the addition of antibiotics and draining of loculated peritoneal fluid and gallbladder. A CT scan of the abdomen with rectal contrast shows free air near"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma who has undergone multiple surgeries including right hemi-colectomy, exploration laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.

Based on the progress note, the patient's medical complications and conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was extubated yesterday but became tachypneic and hypoxic, so she was reintubated and placed on assisted ventilation (AC).

2. Tachypnea and tachycardia: The patient started the morning with tachypnea and tachycardia, but these symptoms resolved overnight. It is likely related to worsened agitation.

3. Leukocytosis/fevers: The patient had leukocytosis and fevers, which improved with the addition of antibiotics and drainage of loculated peritoneal fluid and gallbladder. A CT abdomen with rectal contrast showed free air near [**Doctor Last Name**] pouch, concerning for leakage, but no significant change from previous.

4. Hypervolemia: The patient was found to be fluid overloaded after treatment for sepsis. She was negative 400ml overnight and restarted on Lasix gtt 1-3mg/h to achieve a"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They are experiencing respiratory failure due to emphysema, lower lobe collapse, and effusions. The patient has also been diagnosed with peritonitis, anemia secondary to blood loss, and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the colon. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and tachycardia. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 745 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and respiratory support. Further evaluation, such as a CT scan, is needed to assess the effusions and determine if they can be drained."

   peritonitis and AMS, and now s/p  ex lap, R colectomy, R diverting
   illeostomy and [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch POD # 13 , and respiratory failure.
   24 Hour Events:
   - CT chest to eval pleural effusions unremarkable - present but not
   huge, unlikely to fix the problem but if no other ideas, can tap prior
   to trach
   - Increasing PEEP as BP and airway pressures allow to recruit more lung
   and assist with extubation
   - Changed antibiotics to PO
   - Overbreathing the vent, becoming alkalotic - tried pressure support
   to decrease minute volume but pt became tachypneic to 40s/50s and with
   very shallow breaths. Restarted AC and increased sedation.
   - started diuresis in evening

   - will not increase PEEP currently at 14
   - recheck ABG later today and try to transition to pressure control
   - will place trach after thoracentesis if pt still does not improve,
   but will likely still need diuresis
   #  Agitation: better controlled on Propofol drip but with side effect
   of hypotension.
   - restarting fentanyl for pain

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma who underwent right hemi-colectomy on post-operative day (POD) #16 due to anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status (AMS). She then underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of a [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch on POD #12. The patient also has respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and agitated, opening her eyes to voice but not responding to painful stimuli, moving all limbs spontaneously, and showing no signs of conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 683, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 1.3 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 91 to 117 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemi-colectomy, peritonitis, and acute mental status changes. She underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and [Doctor Last Name] pouch.
- The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure after failed extubation. She is also agitated, leukocytosis with fevers, hypervolemia, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), and has a drainable pleural effusion.
- The patient's current medications include furosemide, propofol, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, famotidine, haloperidol, insulin, albuterol, magnesium sulfate, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and sarna lotion.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 753 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 1.8 mmol/L, hypoalbuminemia at 2.0 g/dL, hyponatremia at 28 mEq/L, hyperkalemia at 4 mg/dL, hypomagnesemia at 1.8 mg/dL, and hypocalcemia at 8.2 mg/dL.
- The patient has a drainable pleural effusion and atelectatic lung, and the non-contrast CT chest is ordered to evaluate for any other collections.
- The patient is scheduled for a pressure support trial after adjusting lung status, and the ABG will be checked and reattempt aline placement today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of pleural effusions and atelectatic lung, making ventilation difficult.
2. Pleural Effusion: The drainable pleural effusion needs to be addressed as it can cause respiratory distress and potential infection if not managed properly.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction, requiring careful management of fluids and vasopressors.
4. Agitation: The patient's agitation needs to be controlled to prevent self-extubation or injury, and propofol drip is currently being used to sedate the patient.
5. Leukocytosis/Fevers: The patient's leukocytosis and fevers may indicate an ongoing infection, which should be evaluated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemi-colectomy POD #16, complicated by anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status. She then underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch POD #12, and is now experiencing respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes severe COPD and pulmonary edema, leading to compression atelectasis. She underwent a thoracentesis by IP and 4L diuresis yesterday with improvement on chest X-ray. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy tomorrow and wean PEEP in preparation for it.

Additionally, the patient has recurrent fevers up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, along with hypotension and leukocytosis. There are no signs of diarrhea or line erythema. The plan is to continue ciprofloxacin and Flagyl orally for pan-sensitive E. coli growing from peritoneal fluid. A CT scan of the abdomen with PO and IV contrast will be done, and if fluid collections are present, they will be drained. If no collections are found, the central venous line (CVL) will be removed. Follow-up cultures and infectious disease recommendations will also be implemented.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma who has undergone multiple surgeries including right hemicolectomy, exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of a [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient experienced multi-lumen issues, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and an attempt at extubation that was unsuccessful. The patient was reintubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. A chest X-ray showed a new consolidation on chest aspiration, and the patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn. She also had a bronchopleural fistula and required thoracentesis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 104.8°F, heart rate in the 130s, blood pressure in the 70s systolic, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's general appearance is intubated but awake and following commands. She is trying to speak and write messages on paper.

On physical examination, the patient has a normocephalic, atraumatic head with no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. Her neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly."

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):  While
   she is mobilizing secretions from her lungs they do not appear
   purulent, may be from resolving prior VAP.  The central line was
   discontinued early in the day yesterday.
 HYPOTENSION:  In setting of fever need to consider recurrent
   infection and early sepsis albeit also had been aggresively diuresed
   and was likley intravascularly depleted.  Responded well to limited
   fluid challenge.  She was pancultured.  She also had blood per rectum
   that was not described as 'old' looking so concerned about more acute
   bleeding in setting of labile BP over the course of the day yesterday.
   Hct has been stable so will continue to follow serial Hcts.  Also given
   high fevers, some eosinophilia on diff yesterday and housestaff noting
   rash yesterday also need to consider drug fever. Most likely related to
   one of the antibiotics that she is on.  Given the confusing picture
   from an ID standpoint and even with increased WBC overnight and labile
   BP which she has other reasons to explain
 COAGULOPATHY:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to being on broad spectrum abx.  Will
   give vitamin K given concern about blood loss.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Likely realted to
   aggressive diuresis, transient hypotension, and received contrast with
   the abdominal CT.   Has received some fluid back, will follow repeat
   electrolytes.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING): As
   above.

   Disposition : ICU
   Total time spent: 65 minutes  Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's condition suggests worsening respiratory function, which may lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, elevated white blood cell count, and symptoms such as blood per rectum indicate possible sepsis. This condition can progress rapidly and lead to organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.

3. Renal failure, acute (acute kidney injury): The patient's lab results show an increase in serum creatinine levels, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This could be related to aggressive diuresis, hypotension, and contrast exposure during imaging.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT/INR and low platelet count suggest impaired blood clotting mechanisms. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the reported blood per rectum.

5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension, and the fluid balance chart shows significant fluid input and output discrepancies. This may contribute to electrolyte imbalances and further fluid management challenges.

6. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), colorectal: The patient's medical history mentions colorectal cancer. It is essential to consider ongoing cancer management alongside addressing the acute critical care issues.

7. Pain control: The patient is on fentanyl for pain management. Ensuring adequate pain control is crucial for patient comfort and overall well-being.

8. Other considerations: The patient's history of prior ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the presence of eosinophilia raise the possibility of drug fever or an allergic reaction to medications. Monitoring for any signs of drug-related complications is necessary.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and aggressive management of the identified complications to improve their chances of recovery."

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemi-colectomy performed 16 days ago, complicated by anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status. The patient subsequently underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of a colonic pouch 12 days ago, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fevers, hypotension, leukocytosis, and bradycardia. She is intubated but self-extubated. She is on invasive ventilation with a SpO2 of 81% and FiO2 of 70%. Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, normal temperature, and low respiratory rate. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for 3+ bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities and cutting wounds on both upper extremities. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate levels. Her blood cultures have been obtained, and she is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to failed extubation but subsequent improvement. She also has recurrent fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis, which"

- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries.
- She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.
- The patient self-extubated at 1:30 pm, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure with an oxygen saturation of 81%.
- She showed signs of tachycardia, hypertension, and agitation, which may indicate flash pulmonary edema, reaccumulation of pleural fluid, or exacerbation of COPD.
- The patient's lasix gtt was stopped at 4 am, and she may have reaccumulated pleural fluid, causing tachypnea and subsequent tachycardia.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension.
- She has leukocytosis with a significant number of bands, suggesting a possible source of infection in the abdomen or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient is hypervolemic and goal-directed diuresis is being used to achieve negative fluid balance.
- She has acute kidney injury (ARF) with an increase in creatinine from 0.3 to 0.6, likely due to hypotension and contrast exposure.

   - SELF EXTUBATED!!!!!!! at 1:30 pm (had been planned for extubation or
   trach at 3pm) and started saying ""I don't need this tube"" :) Continued
   to sat high 90s with supplemental oxygen (NC and shovel mask). Was OOB
   to chair sitting up, asking for coffee.
   - no more fevers but bandemia from AM concerning so kept on
   antibiotics. Potentially planned for CT guided drainage of abdominal
   collections tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemi-colectomy performed 16 days ago, followed by an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of a Doctor Last Name pouch 12 days ago. The patient also has respiratory failure.

The patient unplanned extubation at 1:30 pm. She was initially satting 88% on RA, but then her oxygen saturation improved to high 90s on a face mask. The patient was out of bed, sitting in a chair, asking for coffee, and showing no signs of distress or stridor. She was able to speak and write messages on paper.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114 to 156/86-102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 81%. The patient's maximum temperature in the past 24 hours was 37°C.

The patient has been receiving various medications including Fentanyl, Famotidine, Heparin Sodium, Furosemide, and Morphine Sulfate. She has also been on antibiotics such as Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  Likely multifactorial with
   persistent total body fluid overload, bilateral pleural effusions,
   continues to be negative with diuresis.  Running out of options for
   optimizing her underlying COPD.  Have been holding off on starting
   steroids given unclear ID pitcure, concern over loculated fluid
   collections in the abdomen. Will discuss with surgical team prior to
   starting. At this point would try IV steroids as we try to keep her
   from being reintubated and requiring tracheostomy.  Could have
   aspirated this morning given notation of significant upper airway
   seccretiions.  continue BiPAP. With tachycardia/hypertension in setting
   of respiraotry distress also need to consider flash pulmonary edema,
   seems to have settled down with restarting lasix and morphine to reduce
   preload.  Surgical service made the decision to continue vanco/zosyn
   albeit unclear what we are covering. WBC back down today.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):  No
   further significant blood per rectum.  Hct remains stable.  Continue to
   monitor labs.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Stable Cr,
   tolerating diuresis. Continues to be total body fluid overload so
   continue to have goal to keep ~1L negative over next 24 hours.
 PERITONITIS (NON-SBP):  Still concerned about loculated fluid
   collections in abdomen.  On abx.  Surgical service considering need to
   drain these collections.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include acute on chronic respiratory distress, sepsis, anemia secondary to blood loss, acute renal failure, and peritonitis. The patient's respiratory distress may be due to persistent total body fluid overload and bilateral pleural effusions. The note also mentions concerns about flash pulmonary edema, which has settled down with the restart of lasix and morphine to reduce preload.

The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, but further significant blood loss has been controlled. The patient's renal function is stable, with a stable creatinine level and tolerance to diuresis. However, the patient remains total body fluid overloaded.

Peritonitis is still a concern, as there are loculated fluid collections in the abdomen. The patient is receiving antibiotics for this condition, and the surgical service is considering the need to drain these collections.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of these multiple medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemicolectomy, peritonitis, and acute mental status change. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and pouch. The patient also has respiratory failure and was self-extubated on 3/22. She is currently on mechanical ventilation via bipap.

The patient's condition has been unstable overnight with episodes of hypoxia, agitation, and tachycardia. These episodes were initially thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema, mucous plugging, or atelectasis. The patient responded well to morphine, ativan, and haldol. However, her serum creatinine has increased from 0.4 to 0.7, indicating acute kidney injury, likely due to overdiuresis.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, hypervolemia, and lower extremity edema. The plan includes gentle diuresis, continuation of bipap, consideration for reintubation, and monitoring of the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemi-colectomy, anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and acute mental status changes, who underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of a pouch, and is now experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 81% this morning, possibly due to flash pulmonary edema, reaccumulation of pleural fluid, mucous plugging, atelectasis, or acute worsening of COPD. The patient may also have hypotension due to lasix gtt and positive pressure from bipap, as well as leukocytosis with bands, possibly from an intra-abdominal source or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has hypervolemia and acute renal failure with a creatinine bump from 0.3 to 0.6, likely due to hypotension and contrast exposure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 81% this morning, indicating a potential complication related to respiratory function.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be caused by the lasix gtt and positive pressure from bipap.
3. Leukocytosis with bands: The patient's white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Mulitfactorial with underlying
   COPD, resolving VAP, volume overload. No significant improvement
   despite trying to aggressively diurese.  Now seing a rise in her Cr and
   borderline blood pressures.   Her WBC is normal today and she has not
   had further fever spikes so doubt recurrent PNA.  Bronchodilators q 4
   hours.  Inhaled corticosteroids started.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Cr bump with
   continued diuresis attempts.
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):  Had
   another episode of maroon liquid per rectum overnight.  Hct went from
   28.2 to 27.5. Will continue to monitor CBCs and rectal output.
   Surgical service aware of this event overnight.
ASSYMETRIC LE EDEMA:  Given risk for DVT will check LENIs.
 PERITONITIS (NON-SBP):  Will continue zosyn at this point, stop
   vancomycin.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is acute on chronic respiratory failure and anastomotic leak. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and tachypnea. The SpO2 level is 97%, indicating that the patient is receiving adequate oxygenation. 

The patient's respiratory support includes the use of BiPAP, with settings such as Vt (Spontaneous) at 604 mL, PS at 10 cmH2O, RR (Spontaneous) at 27, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and PIP at 20 cmH2O. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 50, PaO2 of 143, and HCO3- of 29, suggesting respiratory acidosis with compensation. 

The patient has received several medications, including morphine, ativan, heparin, lasix, haldol, and famotidine. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.4, anemia with an Hct of 29.6, thrombocytopenia with a Plt of 108,000, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). Other lab results include elevated D-dimer"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemicolectomy on POD #19 due to anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status. She also underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting illeostomy, and creation of a [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch on POD #15, followed by respiratory failure.

The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, with an oxygen saturation drop to 81% this morning. She also exhibited tachypnea, tachycardia, and agitation at 11 pm, leading to concerns of flash pulmonary edema, mucous plugging, or atelectasis. Overnight, her respiratory distress improved on bipap, morphine, ativan, and haldol.

The patient's creatinine level has risen, indicating potential overdiuresis. Her current respiratory distress is likely attributed to COPD since VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) appears to be resolving. The patient may need reintubation and should continue on bipap. Gentle diuresis is recommended today with a goal of negative 1L fluid balance.

The patient's hypotension is being managed by titrating lasix to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and intravenous fluids will be administered if the patient remains hypotensive"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries including right hemicolectomy, exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure.

- The patient has been on bipap most of the day and had a temporary cessation of Lasix due to hypotension. The PICC line was placed but needed repositioning as it was going upward in the internal jugular vein.

- The patient has shown improvement in fever (hypothermia) after being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn, likely resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The antibiotics have been discontinued.

- The patient is being treated for hypoxic respiratory failure with high-dose steroids and bipap. If she still requires bipap after the steroid treatment, a tracheostomy may be needed.

- Hypotension has improved since stopping the Lasix gtt, and a Lasix bolus of 20 mg IV was administered.

- The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with a baseline near baseline at 0.6. Gentle diuresis using Lasix is being continued.

- Leukocytosis resolved"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma who underwent a right hemi-colectomy on postoperative day (POD) #19 due to an anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status (AMS). She then underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch on POD #15, and has respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include being on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) most of the day, stopping lasix due to hypotension, placement of a Dobhoff tube for feeding, placement of a percutaneous catheter (PICC) line that was initially placed in the right internal jugular vein but was pulled back to make a midline, and starting total parenteral nutrition (TF) at a goal rate of 20 cc/h.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**], and was physically present with the
   ICU team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   the note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize
   and add the following points:
   Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] has tolerated BiPAP well thus far and has had NG tube
   placed for feeding. Steroids were started for COPD flare and she
   appears to be responding slowly to diuretics. her voice is stronger and
   is keen to transition to a chair today.
   Exam notable for obese WF Tm of 98.6 BP110/72 HRof 84 RR of 14 with
   sats of 98% on BiPAP . She has good breath sounds at bases and
   resolving anasarca.
    Labs notable for WBC of 4.6 K, HCTof 28.7 , K+ 3.3, Cr 0.6, lactate of
   < 2. CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and possible Left > right
   effusions. Interstitial edema improved .
   Agree with plan to transition to chair to help improve diaphragmatic
   excursions, continue steroids at high doses for 48 hrs ( then wean) and
   attempt to take off BiPAP when sitting. tube feeds will continue per
   surgical staff recs and diuresis ( with albumin) too. I am hopeful she
   will stay off the ventilator but overall nutritional health is the
   biggest impediment to getting better with supportive Rx.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma status post right hemi-colectomy POD #19, complicated by anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status. She has undergone an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting illeostomy, and creation of a [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch POD #15, and is currently experiencing respiratory failure.

24-hour events:
- The patient was on bipap most of the day.
- Lasix gtt was stopped in the morning due to hypotension, and the patient improved when placed in trendelenberg position. No fluid bolus was administered.
- [**Doctor First Name 3**] placed a Dobhoff tube for feeding.
- PICC line was placed but ended up in the right internal jugular vein, so it was pulled back to make a midline. TF (total parenteral nutrition) was started at Dr[**Name (NI) 5071**]'s goal of 20cc/h.
- Per [**Doctor First Name **] recommendations, Lasix 20 IV was given in the afternoon.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

Prophylaxis:
DVT: Stress ulcer: VAP:

Medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a risk of developing septic shock.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection.
6. Hypervolemia: The patient has excess fluid volume, which may contribute to respiratory distress.
7. Lower extremity edema: The patient has swelling in the lower extremities, which may indicate fluid overload or venous thromboembolism.
8. Access issues: The PICC line needs repositioning due to going upward in the internal jugular vein, and there is a risk of complications associated with central line placement.
9. Feeding tube issues: The patient requires enteral nutrition, and there is a risk of complications related to feeding tube placement and management.
10. Pulmonary prophylaxis: The patient requires measures to prevent pulmonary complications, such as deep vein thrombosis and stress ul"

   #   Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Pt self extubated [**3-22**].  Now
   requiring BiPap x72h with only short tolerate on facemask/NC. Plan is
   to treat COPD with 48h high-dose steroids and then reevaluate for signs
   of improvement vs reintubation and trach. Has not slept since
   extubation (4 days) and becoming delirius. ABG normal without signs of
   hypoxia or hypercarbia. Did not respond to haldol or trazadone,
   hesitating to give meds that decrease resp drive.
   - on solumedrol for COPD, cont nebs
   - continue bipap, may need to reintubate
   - gentle diuresis today, goal even
   - maximal rest from BiPAP mask today given skin breakdown but given
   mental status may not tolerate it well and attempt to remove mask, in
   which case she instantly desats into 70s-80s.
   - discuss plan with surgery, unclear if waiting until this evening
   (48hrs) will make significant enough change to put her thought
   discomfort of BiPAP and continue to prevent sleep/worsen delirium.
   # Hypotension- has improved since lasix gtt stopped.
   - Bolus lasix prn diuresis.
   # Hypervolemia
 Unclear how much overloaded she remains. Renal

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, and transverse colon adenocarcinoma who underwent a transverse colectomy, had an anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status. She then underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch creation. The patient is currently dependent on BiPAP for respiratory support post self-extubation and has intermittent sepsis, persistent respiratory failure, difficulty extubating, and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient requires BiPAP due to intermittent sepsis and persistent respiratory failure. There is a possibility of reintubation and tracheostomy if the patient does not tolerate BiPAP well.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing confusion and agitation, wanting to remove the BiPAP mask, leading to episodes of desaturation. Sleep deprivation may worsen delirium.
3. Nasal skin breakdown: The patient has developed nasal skin breakdown due to prolonged use of BiPAP masks.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved since stopping lasix gtt. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary.
5. Hypervolemia: The patient's renal function is normal, but it is unclear how much fluid overload she remains"

   #   Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Pt self extubated [**3-22**].  Now
   requiring BiPap x72h with only short tolerate on facemask/NC. Plan is
   to treat COPD with 48h high-dose steroids and then reevaluate for signs
   of improvement vs reintubation and trach. Has not slept since
   extubation (4 days) and becoming delirius. ABG normal without signs of
   hypoxia or hypercarbia. Did not respond to haldol or trazadone,
   hesitating to give meds that decrease resp drive.
   - on solumedrol for COPD with improved wheezing-> will decrease dose as
   likely having worsening delirium from steroids
   - continue bipap, with maximal wean to mask today given skin
   - gentle diuresis today, goal even to slightly negative
   - appears strong enough to wean but problem is mental status/delirium
   - CXR with increased fluid/atalectasis. Will consider pigtail placement
   tomorrow
   # Delirium: likely combination of lack of sleep, steroids, long
   hospitalization. ABG normal while on BiPAP so no hypercarbia or hypoxia
   contribution.
   - aggressive sedation to induce sleep with ativan, haldol. Monitor
   respiratory status carefully
   # Hypotension- has improved since lasix gtt stopped.
   - Bolus lasix prn diuresis.
   # Hypervolemia
 Unclear how much overloaded she remains. Renal
   function still
normal
 with diuresis, but double creatinine above
   recent 0.3 and simultaneously close to pt

   hospitalization. Difficult to assess but  clinically not significantly
   overloaded.
   - Was even yest with Lasix 20mg x 2 and 40mg x 1.  Given incensible
   losses, an improvement. This morning negative 500.
   - Goal even to slightly negative. Putting out well to 40mg.
   #  ARF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries. She presented with intermittent sepsis, persistent respiratory failure, difficulty extubating, and dependence on BiPAP post self-extubation. The patient has been on high-dose steroids for COPD treatment and is showing signs of delirium. She requires continued support with BiPAP and maximal weaning to a mask due to skin breakdown. The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating diuresis. Her renal function is normal, but there is concern for possible overload. The patient also has leukocytosis, which is likely resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and intrabdominal collections. She has asymmetric lower extremity edema and an ordered LENI. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's intermittent sepsis and persistent respiratory failure indicate a potential complication of hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently dependent on BiPAP, and there is concern about worsening delirium from steroids.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, likely due to lack of sleep, steroids, and long hospitalization. ABG results are normal, so hypercarbia or hypoxia does not seem to be contributing factors.
3. Hypotension: The patient has shown"

   now s/p  ex lap, R colectomy, R diverting illeostomy and [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch,

   difficulty extubating and dependence on BiPAP post self-extubation.
   #   Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Pt self extubated [**3-22**].  Now
   requiring BiPap x72h with only short tolerate on facemask/NC. Plan is
   to treat COPD with 48h high-dose steroids and then reevaluate for signs
   of improvement vs reintubation and trach. Has not slept since
   extubation (4 days) and becoming delirius. ABG normal without signs of
   hypoxia or hypercarbia. Did not respond to haldol or trazadone,
   hesitating to give meds that decrease resp drive.
   - on solumedrol for COPD with improved wheezing-> will decrease dose as
   likely having worsening delirium from steroids
   - continue bipap, with maximal wean to mask today given skin
   - gentle diuresis today, goal even to slightly negative
   - appears strong enough to wean but problem is mental status/delirium
   - CXR with increased fluid/atalectasis. Will consider pigtail placement
   tomorrow
   # Delirium: likely combination of lack of sleep, steroids, long
   hospitalization. ABG normal while on BiPAP so no hypercarbia or hypoxia
   contribution.
   - aggressive sedation to induce sleep with ativan, haldol. Monitor
   respiratory status carefully
   # Hypotension- has improved since lasix gtt stopped.
   - Bolus lasix prn diuresis.
   # Hypervolemia
 Unclear how much overloaded she remains. Renal
   function still
normal
 with diuresis, but double creatinine above
   recent 0.3 and simultaneously close to pt

   hospitalization. Difficult to assess but  clinically not significantly
   overloaded.
   - Was even yest with Lasix 20mg x 2 and 40mg x 1.  Given incensible
   losses, an improvement. This morning negative 500.
   - Goal even to slightly negative. Putting out well to 40mg.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**], and was physically present with the
   ICU team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   the note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize
   and add the following points:
   Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] has tolerated BiPAP for nearly 2.5 hrs but had worsening
   respiratory distress last night ( ? CHF vs aspiration) with agitation (
   needed haldol). She is now restrained.
   Exam notable for obese WF Tm of 98.6 BP110/72 HRof 84 RR of 14 with
   sats of 98% on BiPAP. She has good breath sounds anteriorly and
   resolving anasarca. Mucous membranes are dry. She is thristy and TBB is
   negative by 0.5 L with lasix/ albumin.
    Labs notable for WBC of 6.2 K, HCTof 28.7 , K+ 3.6, Cr 0.7, lactate
   of 1.2 and ABG of 7.44/43 and Po2 of 81 on 50% FiO2 and BiPAP. CXR with
   bibasilar atelectasis, worsening effusions R>L and small lung volumes.
   Agree with plan to taper steroids ( ? adding to agitation), continue
   diuresis and NIPPV with low dose ativan ( to help with sleep) and
   nutritional support through NG tube.  Hopefully as agitation and
   hypoxemia improves, she will be able to tolerate some time off BiPAP.
   If not, then will need consideration of ETT/ Trach next week.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries including transverse colectomy with anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and abdominal compartment syndrome (AMS). The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy with [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch. She is currently dependent on BiPAP post self-extubation and requires positive pressure to keep her airways open due to pleural effusions and atelectasis. The patient has intermittent sepsis, persistent respiratory failure, and difficulty extubating.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient requires BiPAP for short periods only and has not slept since extubation (4 days). There is a plan to continue steroids for COPD and reevaluate for signs of improvement or reintubation and tracheostomy.

2. Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to lack of sleep, steroids, and long hospitalization. Haldol can be used when needed, and ativan should only be used if necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved since stopping lasix. She is normotensive today.

4. Hypervolemia: It is unclear how much the patient is volume overloaded"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are experiencing acute respiratory failure due to underlying COPD and volume overload, as well as delirium and anxiety. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, peritonitis, and colorectal cancer. The patient is also in need of pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's persistent respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental state suggests delirium, which can be caused by medications or toxic-metabolic factors.
3. Anxiety: The patient exhibits signs of anxiety, which could be related to their current medical condition or the use of benzodiazepines.
4. Tachycardia: Although the patient's tachycardia has improved, it is essential to monitor their heart rate closely for any signs of deterioration.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels need to be corrected to prevent complications such as muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires close monitoring of kidney function and management of fluid and electrolyte balance.
7. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia secondary to blood loss should be addressed with appropriate transfusions to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

On admission, the patient was started on antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) for suspected infection. He also received furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management, lorazepam (Ativan) for sedation, and famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Heparin sodium was administered as a prophylactic measure for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's vital signs have been closely monitored throughout his stay in the ICU. His temperature has fluctuated between 36.6°C and 37.2°C, with a current temperature of 36.6°C. His heart rate has been stable between 84-111 bpm, with a current rate of 91 bpm. Blood pressure has been within normal limits, ranging from 108/71 mmHg to 138/93 mmHg, with a current reading of 124/83 mmHg. Respiratory rate has been within expected range, varying between 18-35 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation has remained above 94%.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating ongoing respiratory support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection.

3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This may be due to hemorrhage or other causes.

5. Cancer: The patient has a history of colorectal cancer. Cancer can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infections and complications.

6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte disorder, which may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

7. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which can lead to liver damage and increase the risk of infections.

8. Delirium: Although not explicitly stated, the patient's altered mental status could be indicative of delirium, a common complication in critically ill patients.

These are just some of the potential medical complications that can arise in this patient. It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate interventions to prevent further complications"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with ongoing respiratory support. Bronchoscopy was performed to assess airway patency but showed no significant improvement.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with multiple medical complications. These include fever (hypothermia), tachycardia, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), peritonitis, respiratory failure, cancer (colon cancer), and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/83 mmHg to 138/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, anticoagulants, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, endotracheal tube in place, no signs of pallor or jaundice, normal heart sounds, clear breath"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing persistent acute respiratory failure post-operation, primarily due to atelectasis and possible infiltrates. There is a risk of continued dependence on BiPAP, which may lead to skin breakdown. The low threshold for reintubation and tracheostomy is maintained.

2. Delirium: The patient is exhibiting signs of delirium, possibly caused by medications (such as Ativan) and toxic-metabolic factors. This requires careful management.

3. Anxiety: The patient may experience anxiety, for which judicious use of benzodiazepines on an as-needed basis is recommended.

4. Tachycardia: Although improved, the patient initially presented with tachycardia. Monitoring heart rate and rhythm is important to prevent any potential complications.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient had initially presented with hypokalemia but has since been repleted to a level above 4.0. Monitoring potassium levels remains essential.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient showed signs of acute renal failure but has improved. Continued monitoring of kidney function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

7. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, but at this time, the risk for withdrawal is low.

8. Anemia: The patient is experiencing acute anemia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is persistent post-operation. The assessment indicates that the respiratory failure is multifactorial, with predominant atelectasis and possible infiltrates (bilateral). Pleural effusions are mild and unlikely to contribute to respiratory failure. The underlying cause mentioned is COPD.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing delirium, possibly due to medications or toxic-metabolic factors. Anxiety is also present, and benzodiazepines are being used judiciously on an as-needed basis. Tachycardia has improved, and hypokalemia has been addressed.

The patient is also dealing with acute renal failure, which has improved, as well as anemia secondary to blood loss during surgery. There is a concern for ongoing bleeding from the [**Doctor Last Name 4888**] pouch. Cancer of the colon is mentioned, with surgical resection performed. Pain control is a priority, and physical therapy consultation has been requested.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary formula at a rate of 50 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained, and appropriate lines have been placed. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and VAP prevention with elevated head of bed and mouth care.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgery for transverse colectomy with anastomotic leak and peritonitis. The patient underwent another surgery for right colectomy with diverting ileostomy and creation of [**Doctor Last Name**] pouch. She is currently dependent on bipap due to persistent respiratory failure and self-extubation.

The patient's 24-hour events include rechecking HCT, starting acetazolamide, negative LENIs, administration of Haldol and Lorazepam, and requests for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/77 mmHg to 166/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has increased from 69.2 kg at admission to 98 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net input of 1,853 mL and output of 2,190 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 337 mL. The respiratory support indicates the use of bipap mask, CPAP/PSV mode, set parameters, and ABG results.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure. She was self-extubated on 3/22 and has been on BiPAP for five days. The patient finished treatment on 3/28 with high-dose steroids for COPD. An ABG yesterday showed increased carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels. The patient's medical history includes delirium, tachycardia, chest pain, hypotension, renal failure, leukocytosis, and LE edema. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including diuretics, BiPAP, ipratropium nebs, xopenex nebs, haldol, ativan, and enzymes for chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and COPD, she may be at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of her underlying lung disease.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and inverted T waves on EKG indicate possible cardiac involvement. Further cardiac evaluation is necessary to rule out any myocardial injury or ischemia.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level today is 0.7, indicating acute renal failure. Monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, likely due to lack of"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She self-extubated and has been on BiPAP for 7 days. She received high-dose steroids for her COPD exacerbation and has shown improvement in respiratory status with diuresis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 133/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and a weight of 98 kg.

The patient has been receiving various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, furosemide, and albuterol nebs, which have been changed to xopenex nebs due to tachycardia. She also received piperacillin/tazobactam but is now on vancomycin and other antibiotics for leukocytosis and suspected infection.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.8 g/dL, blood glucose of 370 mg/dL, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 1569 ng/mL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but her renal function tests show slightly elevated creatinine levels. The cardiac enzymes are negative,"

   Acute respiratory failure, persistent, post-op.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- self-extubated [**2158-3-22**].  Required BiPAP, near
   continuous.  multifactorial; predominately atalectasis, possible
   infiltrates (bilateral).  Pleural effusions mild, unlikely contributing
   to respiratory failure.  Underlying COPD.  Making progress.  Would
   maintain low threshold for reintubation, and move to trach.
   DELERIUM -- medications ( ativan), and toxic-metabolic.  Improving.
   ELEVATED WBC -- monitor for evolving infection.  Pan-culture (blood,
   urine, gallbladder tube, stool) and check LFT, amylase, lipase.  D/C
   antibiotics as planned.  Monitor off antibiotics, unless focal
   ABNORMAL ECG -- inverted T-waves in lateral leads.  Concern for
   ischemia.  Continue to check cardiac enzymes, repeat echo --> ?new wall
   motion abnormalities.
   ANXIETY -- judicious use of benzodiazepines prn.
   TACHYCARDIA -- improved.  Monitor.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to >4.0
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- improved.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   ANEMIA SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS  -- persistent bleeding via [**Doctor Last Name 4888**]

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is experiencing respiratory distress. They were self-extubated and required BiPAP support due to multifactorial causes such as atelectasis and possible bilateral infiltrates. The patient has a history of COPD and is being closely monitored for reintubation and potential tracheostomy. They are also experiencing delirium, which is improving, and have an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible evolving infection. The patient's abnormal ECG shows inverted T-waves in lateral leads, raising concerns for ischemia. They are receiving nutritional support through tube feeding and have anemia secondary to blood loss during surgery. There are also concerns about peritonitis, colon cancer, pain control, and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient's condition requires ICU care, including glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, as well as measures to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. They have a history of COPD and recent surgical resection for colorectal cancer. The patient has been experiencing delirium, possibly due to medications or toxic-metabolic causes, but is improving. There is also an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an evolving infection, and abnormal ECG findings that raise concerns for ischemia. Other issues include anxiety, tachycardia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure, nutritional support, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, peritonitis, and a history of alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires BiPAP and has underlying COPD, which can contribute to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count suggests a possible evolving infection, and the patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Ischemia: The inverted T-waves in lateral leads on the ECG raise concerns for ischemia, and cardiac enzymes should be monitored for further evaluation.
4. Renal failure: The patient has shown signs of acute renal failure, which needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Nutritional support: The patient requires nutritional support due to their critical condition.
6. Anemia: The patient is experiencing acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which needs to be addressed and managed.
7. Peritonitis: There is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypoxic resp failure: self extubated [**3-22**].  Now on biPAP x7 days with
   b-d on nose. Finished tx on [**3-28**] with high dose steroids for COPD.
   Respiratory status improving with diuresis.
   - continue diuresis w/ goal 500cc-1L negative
   -misted facemask/non rebreather while pt upright in chair with breaks
   using bipap.  Use bipap o/n.
   - PT consult
   -continue acetazolamide
   - Surgery replaced doboff tube
   -continue ipratropium nebs, changed albuterol to xopenex nebs
   Delirium: likely  due to lack sleep, steroids long hosp. Talking more
   fluently today, though not oriented. Has not slept well in weeks.
   -haldol prn and ativan only if needed, minimize as much as possible.
   Tachycardia
   -changed albuterol to xopenex neb
   Chest pain: T was inversion in [**4-3**]. EKGs have not been progressing.
   Cardiac enzymes negative, echo was poor study w/ slightly decreased EF
   and could not exlude focal WMA.
   - [**Hospital 3227**] medical management w/ ASA, BB
   -AM EKG
   Leukocytosis: Likely inflammatory component given platelets also
   increasing. Would doubt that piperacillin/tazobactam treating anything
   right now as WBC climbing despite and could represent drug reaction.
   - Vancomycin if spikes
   - culture blood,urine, T tube
   - stool for c.dif

   Respiratory status improving with diuresis.
   - continue diuresis w/ goal 1L neg, will check afternoon lytes
   -pt now on high flow and not requiring biPAP
   - PT consult
   -continue acetazolamide
   -continue ipratropium nebs, changed albuterol to xopenex nebs
   .
   Delirium: likely  due to lack sleep, steroids long hosp. Talking more
   fluently today, though not oriented. Has not slept well in weeks.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute respiratory failure, persistent, post-op.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- self-extubated [**2158-3-22**], required BiPAP, near
   continuous.  Multifactorial etiology for resp failure,  predominately
   atalectasis, possible infiltrates (bilateral).  Pleural effusions mild,
   unlikely contributing to respiratory failure.  Underlying COPD.  Making
   slow progress.  Would maintain low threshold for reintubation, and move
   to trach if requires reintubation.
   DELERIUM -- medications ( ativan), and toxic-metabolic.  Improving.
   ELEVATED WBC -- monitor for evolving infection.  Evidence for C. Diff
   Flagyl & Vanco
   ABNORMAL ECG -- inverted T-waves in lateral leads.  Concern for
   ischemia.  Continue to check cardiac enzymes, repeat echo --> ?new wall
   motion abnormalities.  No evidence for new MI.  Monitor.
   ANXIETY -- judicious use of benzodiazepines prn.
   TACHYCARDIA -- improved.  Monitor.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to >4.0
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- improved.  Tolerating net diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   ANEMIA SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS  -- persistent bleeding via [**Doctor Last Name 4888**]
   pouch --> expected post-op progess?  Surgery to f/u.
   PERITONITIS  -- wound infection, possible acalculous cholecystitis -->
   drain in place.
   CANCER, COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER) -- s/p surgical resection.
   PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 optimize meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. They are experiencing respiratory distress, which is attributed to factors such as atelectasis, possible bilateral infiltrates, pleural effusions, and underlying COPD. The patient self-extubated on 03/22/2158 and required continuous BiPAP support. Delirium has been present, likely due to medications and toxic-metabolic causes. There is evidence of C. diff enteritis, and the patient is being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin. Nausea is also reported, which could be multifactorial in origin. The patient has hypernatremia, and efforts are being made to replete free water. An abnormal ECG showing inverted T-waves in the lateral leads raises concerns for ischemia, and cardiac enzymes, echocardiograms, and monitoring will be continued to assess for any new wall motion abnormalities or evidence of a new myocardial infarction. Anxiety is managed with judicious use of benzodiazepines as needed. Tachycardia has resolved, but the patient's potassium levels need to be monitored and repleted if necessary. Acute renal failure has improved, with the patient tolerating net diuresis. Nutritional support is provided through tube feeding (TF). The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, and surgery will follow to address this issue. There are concerns about peritonitis, wound infection,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 98 kg, 66-inch tall male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient was admitted with acute respiratory failure post-op and self-extubated. He required continuous BiPAP support. Multifactorial etiology for respiratory failure, predominantly atelectasis, possible infiltrates (bilateral), pleural effusions. Underlying COPD. The patient is also experiencing delirium, C. diff enteritis, nausea, hypernatremia, abnormal ECG, anxiety, tachycardia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure, nutritional support, anemia secondary to blood loss, peritonitis, colorectal cancer, pain control, and physical therapy consultation. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and history of self-extubation indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. This can be due to atelectasis, possible infiltrates, pleural effusions, and underlying COPD.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be caused by medications (such as Ativan) and toxic-metabolic factors. It is important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.

3. C. diff enteritis: The patient has evidence of C. diff enteritis, which is a bacterial infection that can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Monitoring for evolving infection and continuing appropriate antibiotic therapy (Flag"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

The patient's respiratory failure continues, and she is dependent on BiPAP after self-extubation. She also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) at one point but was able to return to sinus rhythm with the use of Lopressor. The patient has been weaned down to 60s but experienced another episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR, currently being managed with 60% FiO2 and 4L NC on a high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's nausea has not responded to Zofran but was responsive to Compazine. Total fluid input has been 2859 mL, including 683 mL of IV fluids, 150 mL of PO intake, 714 mL of TF intake, and 545 mL of IV output with 183 mL of blood product output. Urine output has been 2410 mL, and NG output has been 350 mL.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and lactic acid levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries. She is currently in the ICU due to anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status (AMS) after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch.

The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is dependent on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) post self-extubation. She experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFR) but was successfully converted back to sinus rhythm with Lopressor.

The patient also presented with nausea, which was initially unresponsive to zofran but responded to compazine. Total fluid intake and output are within normal limits. The patient's vital signs remain relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate ranging from 82 to 132 beats per minute, blood pressure between 106/64 mmHg and 92/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's weight has increased from 69.2 kg at admission to 98 kg currently. Blood product transfusions have been administered, with a total input of 2"

   b-d on nose. Finished tx on [**3-28**] with high dose steroids for COPD.
   Respiratory status improving with diuresis.
   - surgery has no specific I/Os goal today, pt nauseous this AM and TF
   with residuals so holding TF and later will advance to full liquids
   -pt now on high flow
   -continue acetazolamide
   -continue ipratropium nebs, changed albuterol to xopenex nebs on [**3-29**] to
   help with tachycardia
   -Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   Delirium: likely  due to lack sleep, steroids long hosp. Talking more
   fluently today, though not oriented. Has not slept well in weeks.
   -improving but still confused

The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is dependent on bipap (bi-level positive airway pressure) post self-extubation.

The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was given lopressor 2.5 IV twice before returning to sinus rhythm. She also had nausea, which was initially unresponsive to zofran but responded to compazine. Total parenteral nutrition (TF) was stopped due to nausea, and there was a consideration of starting reglan.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 98-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxemia. He experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was treated with lopressor IV bolus. The patient continues to have bloody discharge from the rectum, nausea, and is up in a chair today. He has a history of colorectal cancer, for which he underwent surgical resection. The patient also has acute respiratory failure due to atelectasis and possible bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusions, underlying COPD. Other issues include C. diff enteritis, hypernatremia, abnormal ECG with inverted T-waves in lateral leads, anxiety, tachycardia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure, nutritional support, anemia secondary to blood loss, peritonitis, and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent acute respiratory failure indicates a potential risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of C. diff enteritis, peritonitis, and wound infection suggests an increased risk of developing infections in the ICU setting. These infections can worsen the patient's overall condition and prolong their stay in the ICU.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure indicates impaired kidney function. If not managed properly, it can lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has persistent acute respiratory failure post-operation, with multifactorial etiology including atelectasis, possible infiltrates (bilateral), and pleural effusions. The patient required continuous BiPAP and continues to be weaned off FiO2.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) enteritis: The patient is being treated for C. diff infection with Flagyl and Vancomycin. Monitoring for evolving infection is ongoing.

3. Nausea: The patient's abdominal examination is unchanged and benign. Nausea is likely multifactorial, including medications, and tube feeds have been held.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were initially high, but have since resolved with repleted free water via infusion. Sodium levels will continue to be monitored.

5. Abnormal ECG: The patient has inverted T-waves in lateral leads. Monitoring with clinical indications is ongoing.

6. Anxiety: Judicious use of benzodiazepines as needed for anxiety.

7. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has resolved, but will continue to be monitored.

8. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels have been repleted to above 4.0.

9. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries including transvers colectomy, anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and AMS. She recently underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and diverting ileostomy with [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch.

The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is dependent on bipap post self-extubation. She has been restarted on TF but with caution due to nausea. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 116/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high flow neb. 

The patient's physical examination reveals more fatigue but remains interactive. Cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or gallops. Pulmonary examination indicates decreased breath sounds at both bases bilaterally. Abdominal examination is soft with no tenderness, guarding, or shifting dullness. Extremities show no upper extremity edema but have positive lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactic acid, elevated D-dimer, and positive C. difficile test. Other labs show within normal ranges.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries including transverse colectomy with anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and abdominal sepsis. The patient has undergone exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on bipap after self-extubation. Oxygen delivery device has been changed to high-flow nasal cannula with SpO2 of 99%. ABG results are available but not mentioned in the prompt.
- Cardiovascular system: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, with a blood pressure of 116/64 mmHg and heart rate of 94 bpm.
- Abdominal system: The patient has no blood per rectum, and the abdomen is soft with no hernias or masses detected.
- Extremities: The patient has no upper extremity edema but has positive lower extremity edema.
- Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, hemoglobin is 8.4 g/dL, sodium is 111 mg/dL, potassium is 3.5 mEq/L, creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL, glucose is 139 mg/dL, and troponin T is 0.01 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure requires close monitoring and adjustment of oxygen therapy.
2. Chest pain: The patient previously experienced chest pain, which could be indicative of cardiac issues. Further evaluation is necessary to rule out any cardiac complications.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. Monitoring for fever and checking the differential count is recommended.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection, which can lead to diarrhea and abdominal pain. Monitoring ostomy output and following up with cultures is important.
5. Delirium: The patient has resolved delirium but may still require close monitoring due to previous episodes of altered mental status.

It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results. Adjustments to medications, such as weaning off diuretics and optimizing pain management, should be considered. Close collaboration between the surgical, medical, and respiratory teams will be essential in managing the patient's complex medical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute respiratory failure, persistent, post-op.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- self-extubated [**2158-3-22**], slow progress, required
   near continuus BiPAP.  Multifactorial etiology for resp failure,
   predominately atalectasis, possible infiltrates (bilateral), leural
   effusions.  Underlying COPD.  COntinue to wean FiO2.
   C. diff enteritis -- monitor for evolving infection.  Evidence for C.
   Diff -->  Flagyl & Vanco --> continue.
   NAUSEA -- Abd exam unchanged and benign.  Likley multifactorial,
   including medications, resume TF slowly.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved with repleted free H20 via infusion.  Monitor
   Na+
   ABNORMAL ECG -- inverted T-waves in lateral leads.  Monitor with
   clinical indications.
   TACHYCARDIA -- resolved.  Monitor.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to >4.0
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- improved.  Tolerating net spontaneous diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   ANEMIA SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS  -- persistent bleeding via [**Doctor Last Name 4888**]
   pouch --> expected post-op progess?  Surgery to f/u.
   PERITONITIS  -- wound infection, possible acalculous cholecystitis -->
   drain in place.
   CANCER, COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER) -- s/p surgical resection.
   PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and required near continuous BiPAP due to multifactorial causes such as atelectasis, possible infiltrates, and pleural effusions. Continuous monitoring and weaning of FiO2 is necessary.

2. Clostridium difficile enteritis: The patient is suspected to have C. diff enteritis, which is evidenced by specific laboratory findings. Antibiotic treatment with Flagyl and Vancomycin should be continued.

3. Nausea: The patient is experiencing nausea, likely due to medications and slow reintroduction of tube feeds.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient initially had hypernatremia but resolved with repleted free water infusion. Close monitoring of sodium levels is required.

5. Abnormal ECG: The patient has inverted T-waves in lateral leads, which should be closely monitored along with clinical indications.

6. Tachycardia: The patient previously had tachycardia, but it has since resolved. Continuous monitoring is necessary.

7. Acute renal failure: The patient had signs of acute renal failure but has improved and is tolerating spontaneous diuresis. Ongoing monitoring and management are required.

8. Anemia secondary to blood loss: The patient has persistent bleeding via a surgical pouch, which is expected post-operative progress. Surgery"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries including transverse colectomy with anastomotic leak and peritonitis. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch. 

The patient's current condition is described as follows:
- The patient is dependent on bipap post self-extubation.
- She is experiencing persistent respiratory failure.
- She has been in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) multiple times, which responded to metoprolol IV but not to diltiazem gtt. 
- The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nebulization, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.
- Her vital signs show tachycardia and decreased breath sounds at both bases bilaterally.
- The patient appears uncomfortable and has mild diffuse abdominal tenderness.
- There is no evidence of lower extremity edema, but there is + UE edema with radial pulses 1+ bilaterally, and Dp pulse 1+.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.0, elevated lactate levels, and positive VRE in stool.
- Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
- The patient has improved respiratory status and is now on a nasal canula.
- The episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**4-3**] was likely precipitated by desaturation and did not break with metoprolol IV but did with dilt gtt.
- The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is ongoing, and the chest x-ray shows wet findings.
- The delirium is waxing and waning, and the patient is being monitored.
- The chest pain resolved, but there is a concern for possible cardiac issues, which are being managed medically.
- Leukocytosis is being treated with flagyl IV and decreased PR vanco.
- The patient is being monitored for Clostridium difficile infection.
- Advance TF is being continued as tolerated.
- Repletion of potassium and magnesium is recommended.
- The patient's nutrition is being managed with a pulmonary formula.
- Glycemic control is being maintained.
- Prophylaxis measures include DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she will remain in the ICU for now before being transferred to the surgery floor later this week."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, etoh abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries. She is currently in the ICU and has undergone exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and Doctor Last Name pouch.

The patient's recent events include an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR) that did not respond to metoprolol IV but converted to sinus rhythm with diltiazem gtt. She was switched to oral diltiazem and metoprolol was discontinued. The surgery team did not want to diurese the patient, instead opting to let her settle on her own. Her potassium level was repleted due to a low reading, but repeated tests showed normal levels. The patient also experienced nausea in the evening.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high flow nasal cannula. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is weaning off oxygen as tolerated. 

The patient has a history of anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and acute myocardial syndrome (AMS), for which she"

The patient's respiratory status has improved, now on a nasal canula. 

The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR) that did not respond to metoprolol IV but converted to sinus rhythm with diltiazem gtt. The patient's potassium level was repleted as it was low. 

The patient's nausea was noted in the evening. The troponin T level was 0.02, indicating no signs of cardiac toxicity. The magnesium level was initially high at > 12 and then repeated as > 11 but later came back as 2.4, which is within normal range. 

The patient's heart rate is currently 97 bpm, blood pressure is 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient is tachycardic with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with atrial fibrillation. They have a history of colonic surgery and are currently experiencing respiratory distress due to multifactorial causes such as atelectasis, possible infiltrates, and pleural effusions. The patient also has C. difficile enteritis, for which they are being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin. They are also being managed for anemia secondary to blood loss, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure, and pain control. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and underlying COPD put them at risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. C. difficile Enteritis: The patient's C. difficile infection could lead to complications such as severe diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's ongoing blood loss may result in worsening anemia, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels could lead to dehydration, confusion, seizures, or neurological damage.
6. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, abnormal heart rhythms, and decreased kidney function.

The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch. The patient's respiratory status has improved and she is now on a nasal cannula.

The patient experienced several events overnight, including diuresis of 2100cc, weaning to 6L NC, and conversion back to sinus rhythm after experiencing atrial fibrillation. The patient was given diltiazem 30 PO x1 early for the conversion.

The patient has no known drug allergies. She received vancomycin and metronidazole overnight. She is currently on various ICU medications, including heparin sodium prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/55 to 134/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 69.2 kg at admission to 98 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a net deficit of 2099 mL since 12 AM.

The patient requires ongoing respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. Her ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in general appearance, airway, breathing, or cardiovascular system. The patient has decreased breath sounds at both bases bilaterally, soft abdomen with diffuse tenderness but no rebound tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities show no lower extremity edema but have + upper extremity edema, radial pulses 1+ bilaterally, and dorsalis pedis pulse 1+.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, sodium of 108 mg/dL, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, chloride of 25 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 30.0%, blood urea nitrogen of 12.2 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, glucose of 121 mg/dL, and troponin T of 0.02 mg/dL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient has respiratory failure due to self-extubation, with multifactorial etiology including atelectasis, possible infiltrates, and pleural effusions. The underlying cause seems to be COPD. The patient is currently on BiPAP.
- The patient has C. difficile enteritis, for which they are receiving Flagyl and Vancomycin.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely precipitated by a hypoxemic episode. It is currently controlled with a diltiazem drip, and the plan is to transition to oral diltiazem.
- The patient experiences chronic nausea, which is likely multifactorial and related to medications. Tube feeding is being resumed slowly.
- The patient had hypernatremia, which resolved with repleted free water via infusion. Sodium levels will be monitored.
- The patient had hypokalemia, which has been repleted to >4.0.
- The patient has acute renal failure but has shown improvement and is tolerating spontaneous diuresis.
- The patient requires nutritional support through tube feeding.
- The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss during surgery, which is expected to improve over time.
- The patient has peritonitis due to a wound infection and possible acalculous cholecystitis, with a drain in place.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, and a history of colonic surgery. They were self-extubated and required continuous BiPAP due to multifactorial respiratory failure, primarily atelectasis, possible bilateral infiltrates, and pleural effusions. The underlying cause of respiratory failure is COPD. The patient also has C. difficile enteritis, which is being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin.

The patient's heart rhythm is now controlled on diltiazem drip, but they have a history of nausea, likely caused by medications. Their sodium levels were previously hypernatremic but have been resolved with repleted free water infusion. Potassium levels were hypokalemic and have been repleted to >4.0. The patient is tolerating net spontaneous diuresis, indicating improvement in acute renal failure. They are receiving nutritional support through tube feeding (TF).

The patient has persistent bleeding via a surgical pouch and is expected to undergo further surgical follow-up. There is also a concern for peritonitis, possibly due to wound infection or acalculous cholecystitis, with a drain in place. The patient has a history of colorectal cancer and underwent surgical resection.

The patient's pain control needs optimization, and they require a physical therapy consult. It is planned to transfer the patient to the floor soon. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with respiratory failure following multiple surgeries. She is currently on a regular diet and has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 121/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. She has trace pitting edema and her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for chest pain, which has resolved.

The patient has several medical conditions including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypoxic respiratory failure, and delirium. She is being treated with diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation, nebs for respiratory support, and frequent reorientation for delirium. The patient also has leukocytosis and is being treated for Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal range. The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and is currently on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged delirium: The patient is experiencing ongoing delirium, which may require further evaluation and management.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous transverse colectomy.
- She underwent exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, right diverting ileostomy, and creation of a [Doctor Last Name] pouch.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, and she is now on nasal cannula oxygen.
- She experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but is back in sinus rhythm after early dosing of her PO diltiazem.
- The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure but remains stable on 4L NC with sats in the upper 90s.
- She continues to receive nebulizer treatments and her oxygen can be weaned as tolerated.
- The patient is expected to be transferred to the surgery floor today or tomorrow.
- She has delirium, which waxes and wanes, especially during sunset. Morphine 0.5mg IV x1 was discussed with surgery as an option for pain management.
- Her chest pain has resolved, and cardiac enzymes are negative with no EKG changes.
- The patient is being treated for Clostridium difficile infection with metronidazole and vancomycin.
- Her leukocytosis is trending down, and she remains afebrile.
- Fluid and electrolyte balance is being closely monitored, with particular attention to ostomy output.
- The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines (including a midline catheter) are being managed appropriately.
- Prophylaxis measures include anticoagulation with heparin and stress ulcer prevention.
- The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is still in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure indicates a risk of worsening respiratory function, which could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium, characterized by changes in mental status and fluctuating levels of consciousness, may progress or persist, potentially causing confusion, disorientation, and increased risk of falls or other adverse events.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: Although the patient is being treated for C. diff with metronidazole and vancomycin, there is a risk of complications such as diarrhea, colitis, sepsis, or toxic megacolon.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance is crucial due to the patient's ongoing losses from ostomy output and potential imbalances related to medications or other factors.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent surgical interventions put her at increased risk for developing other infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or wound infections.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced respiratory distress post-operation and required BiPAP support. There are multifactorial causes for the respiratory failure, including atelectasis, possible infiltrates (bilateral), and pleural effusions. The patient also has underlying COPD.

2. Clostridium difficile enteritis (C. diff): The patient has evidence of C. diff infection and is being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (A-fib): The patient has A-fib which is likely precipitated by a hypoxemic episode. It is currently controlled on a diltiazem drip, but the plan is to discontinue the drip and transition to oral diltiazem.

4. Nausea: The patient has nausea, which is multifactorial and includes medications. The plan is to resume tube feeding (TF) slowly.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which resolved with repleted free water via infusion. Monitoring of sodium levels will continue.

6. Hypokalemia: The patient had hypokalemia, which has been repleted to >4.0.

7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure, which has improved. The patient is tolerating net spontaneous diuresis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions that can lead to potential complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications:

1. Chief Complaint: Atrial Fibrillation (A-fib), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
   - A-fib is a cardiac arrhythmia where the atria of the heart do not contract normally, which can potentially lead to complications such as blood clots, stroke, or heart palpitations.
   - CHF is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other parts of the body. Complications can include pulmonary edema, kidney dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

2. Review of Systems:
   - Constitutional: No fatigue, no fever, no weight loss.
   - Cardiovascular: No chest pain, no palpitations, no edema, no tachycardia, no orthopnea.
   - Respiratory: No cough, no dyspnea, no tachypnea, no wheeze.
   - Gastrointestinal: No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
   - Genitourinary: No dysuria, Foley catheter in place, no dialysis.
   - Musculoskeletal: No joint pain, myalgias.
   - Integumentary: No jaundice, no rash.
   - Neurologic: No numb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female who is currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing respiratory failure following multiple surgeries. Her respiratory and mental status have been improving. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is being treated with diltiazem and metoprolol, which will be consolidated to diltiazem alone. She is stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and nebs are being continued. The patient also has delirium and is being transferred to the floor for further management. Other issues include chest pain, which has resolved, leukocytosis, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed in the ICU. Prophylaxis is being provided for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with RVR indicates a potential risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring and continued management with diltiazem will be necessary to maintain rate control.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation with respiratory failure suggests a high risk for recurrent episodes. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and the need for respiratory support will be crucial to prevent further respiratory complications.

3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may continue to be a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with respiratory failure following multiple surgeries. She is currently experiencing improving respiratory and mental status. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (A fib with RVR): The patient is currently rate-controlled on diltiazem and metoprolol but will consolidate to diltiazem alone. The patient's heart rhythm has been stabilized, but it is important to monitor for any recurrence of atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen with sats in the upper 90s. It is important to continue nebulizer treatments and gradually wean off oxygen as tolerated to prevent hypoxemia.

3. Delirium: The patient exhibits fluctuating levels of awareness and orientation, indicating possible delirium. It is important to transfer the patient to the floor, provide frequent reorientation, promote sleep hygiene, and allow for out-of-bed activities during the day to manage delirium.

4. Chest pain: The patient previously experienced chest pain, which has since resolved. However, it is important to continue medical management with antiplatelet agents (ASA), statin, and beta-blocker to prevent further cardiac events.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with respiratory failure following multiple surgeries. The patient's current conditions include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR), hypoxic respiratory failure, and delirium. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is within normal range, heart rate is within normal range but slightly elevated, blood pressure is low, respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is stable in the upper 90s. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.0, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results are within normal range or not significantly abnormal. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing diltiazem for rate control of A fib, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, transferring to the floor, frequent reorientation for delirium, and addressing other medical issues such as chest pain and Clostridium difficile infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation leading to hemodynamic instability, delirium progression or development of new cognitive deficits, and complications related to ongoing management of other medical conditions. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, heart rhythm, mental status, and response to treatment interventions. Regular reassessment and appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan should be made to ensure"

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing episodes of tachycardia (A-fib with RVR) and required additional doses of Diltiazem and eventually a Diltiazem drip. The patient also has C. diff enteritis and is being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin. The patient's respiratory distress persists post-op and is also dealing with nausea, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure, and anemia secondary to blood loss. Other conditions include peritonitis, colorectal cancer, and pain control. The patient's overall condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's A-fib with RVR needs to be closely monitored as it can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. C. diff enteritis: The patient is already being treated for C. diff enteritis with Flagyl and Vancomycin. However, there is a risk of complications like severe diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of congestive heart failure and ongoing respiratory distress, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen if not properly"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. The patient has been experiencing episodes of tachycardia and required additional doses of Diltiazem and eventually Diltiazem drip. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently on a Diltiazem drip, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for tachycardia. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese, PERRL, no conjunctival pallor or edema, normocephalic, no poor dentition, no endotracheal tube, NG tube, or OG tube, normal PMI, S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, clear breath sounds with crackles at the bases, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and oriented to person, place, and time with purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.0, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, sodium of 101 mg/dL, potassium of 3.2 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 111 mg/dL, and troponin T of 0.02. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

Assessment and plan include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, controlled on Diltiazem drip, to be discontinued and transitioned to oral Diltiazem at a higher dose. Beta-blocker to be discontinued. Cardiology consult is planned. C. difficile enteritis, currently being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin. CHF remains total body expanded with pleural effusions, hopes to continue net diuresis. Nausea, possibly multifactorial, including medications. Tolerating PO. Hypernatremia resolved with repleted free water via infusion. Monitor Na+. Hypokalemia repleted to >4.0. Acute renal failure improved, tolerating net diuresis. Nutritional support via PO encouraged.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, transverse colon adenocarcinoma, and previous surgeries. She presented with anastomotic leak, peritonitis, and altered mental status, and underwent an emergency laparotomy, right colectomy, and creation of a diverting ileostomy and [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and she is now on a nasal cannula. She has no known drug allergies and received metronidazole and vancomycin on [**2158-4-7**]. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 108 bpm with a baseline of 86-111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/53 mmHg to 69/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute with a baseline of 24-37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula. Her weight is currently 101.4 kg, with a baseline admission weight of 69.2 kg. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,906 mL, with 1,520 mL taken orally, 386 mL given intravenously, and a total output of 1,435 mL including 200 mL of blood products. Urine output is 1,110 mL, and there is a negative fluid balance of 471 mL. 

The patient requires respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///26/. Physical examination reveals no abnormality in her general appearance, cardiac examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops, pulmonary examination reveals decreased breath sounds at both bases bilaterally, and abdominal examination reveals tenderness without rebound or guarding. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 16.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, sodium level of 106 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.3 mg/dL, and a blood glucose level of 115 mg/dL. Other lab values include creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.02 ng/mL, total CO2 of 26, calcium level of 8.2 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 3.0 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include management for atrial fibrillation with rate control using diltiazem and metoprolol, hypoxic respiratory failure with continued nebs and weaning of oxygen as tolerated, delirium with reorientation and consideration of sleep hygiene, leukocytosis treated with flagyl and vancomycin, cardiac care with ASA and statin, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she is to be dispositioned to the surgery team."
