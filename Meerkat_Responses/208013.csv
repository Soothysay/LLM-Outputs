","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis who has been admitted to the ICU for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He underwent a subtotal colectomy and ileoanal pull-through with J-pouch. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to the ongoing bleed, but the source of the bleeding could not be identified through upper endoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. A tagged red blood cell scan was performed, and the results are pending.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 132/80 to 137/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

On physical examination, the patient appears well, with no signs of pallor or jaundice. His lungs are clear bilaterally, and his abdomen is soft, nontender, and non-distended. His extremities show no edema or calf pain, and he has good pulses in his lower extremities. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented, with intact cranial nerves.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.0%, platelet count of 167 K/uL, blood glucose of 118 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and other medications. He is being monitored closely, with plans to follow up on the tagged RBC scan results and perform additional tests such as an abdominal/pelvic CT and capsule endoscopy. The patient will continue to receive intravenous fluids as needed and maintain two large bore peripheral intravenous lines. He has two active transfusion lines for pRBCs and will be monitored closely. Repeat orthostatics and hemoglobin checks every six hours are planned. The patient should avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and continue intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. 

The patient's disposition will be determined based on the stability of his hematocrit levels. If stable, he may be transferred to the floor later in the afternoon."

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis who underwent a subtotal colectomy and now presents with a lower gastrointestinal bleed (BRBPR). He received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has persistent mild tachycardia. The gastrointestinal team was unable to find any active bleeding on upper endoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, suggesting a possible bleed in the small intestine. A tagged RBC scan was performed, which did not show signs of bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 130s when sitting or standing. He is currently receiving intravenous fluids (IVFs) and has two active transfusion lines for pRBCs. The plan is to monitor the patient closely, maintain large-bore peripheral intravenous lines, and continue with frequent monitoring of hematocrit levels. A capsule endoscopy has been arranged for the patient to be done as an outpatient."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis who underwent a subtotal colectomy and is now presenting with bloody brown urine per rectal passage (BRBPR). The patient has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) but continues to have persistent mild tachycardia. Despite large volumes of intravenous fluids (IVF), the patient remains tachycardic. A tagged red blood cell scan did not show any signs of bleeding. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/65 to 161/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring reveals a fluid balance of 7,140 mL total in, 1,140 mL per os (PO), 6,000 mL intravenous (IVF), and 2,090 mL total out with a balance of 5,050 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with no device and an ABG result of ///27/. Physical examination shows a pleasant and well-appearing male with normal cardiac rhythm, good air movement bilaterally, and non-edematous extremities. The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g"

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis who underwent a subtotal colectomy. He presented with brisk bloody rectal pulsatile (BRBPR) and received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with persistent mild tachycardia despite large volume intravenous fluid resuscitation. The gastrointestinal team was unable to find a source of bleeding on upper endoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, suggesting a possible small intestinal bleed. A tagged red blood cell scan did not show any signs of bleeding. The patient's tachycardia worsened when sitting or standing, indicating potential orthostatic changes. He is being encouraged to increase oral intake and intravenous fluids will be given as needed. The patient's high stool output needs to be addressed, and he will be monitored closely. He has two active transfusion centers for pRBCs. The patient is on telemonitoring, and his hematocrit (Hct) will be monitored daily. He should continue taking proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 

The patient also has a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, for which he is to continue taking PPI medication. Additionally, the patient has depression and is planned to resume amitriptyline when nausea subsides, as well as receive Ativan on an as-needed basis for agitation.
