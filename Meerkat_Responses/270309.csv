","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of severe scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and worsening dyspnea. He presented to an Outpatient Surgery Hospital (OSH) with hypercapnic respiratory failure and subsequently underwent semi-emergent tracheostomy placement. The patient is now being transferred for evaluation of posterior wall erosion.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypercapnic respiratory failure: likely secondary to both restrictive lung process due to severe scoliosis and additional OSA.
- Status post tracheostomy placement with revision due to hypoxemia with trach blockage.
- Using trach valve during the day and continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) at night.
- Transfered for evaluation of posterior tracheostomy erosion.
- Vent settings as per [Location (un) 839].
- Discourage ambient use.
- IP chest x-ray (CXR) in the morning.
- Continue guaifenesin and duoneb.
- Check baseline CXR here.
- Encourage weight loss and pulmonary rehabilitation on discharge.

Additionally, the patient has severe scoliosis and is being managed with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stomach protection and Tylenol for pain, as narcotics from OSH are not part of his home regimen.

The patient also has right ventricular (RV) failure, likely due to moderate pulmonary hypertension (45mmH"

   Imaging: Lung volumes have decreased and opacification particularly in
   the right lung has increased since [**12-1**]. Given the marked
   anatomic distortion of the chest precise diagnosis is difficult, but
   since there is vascular engorgement in the left lung I suspect cardiac
   decompensation is playing a role. There is also the suggestion of
   retained secretions in the bronchial tree, particularly the right.
   Right pleural effusion has probably developed and whether the
   right lower lung is atelectatic or consolidated is radiographically
   indeterminate, as is the extent of presumed cardiomegaly. No

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old male with a history of severe scoliosis,
   restrictive lung disease, OSA, who presented to an OSH with worsening
   dyspnea, who developed hypercapnic respiratory failure w/ semi-emergent
   tacheostomy placement, now transfered for evaluation of posterior wall
   erosion.
    # Hypercapnic respiratory failure: likely secondary to both
   restrictive lung process due to severe scoliosis with additonal OSA.
   Now status post tracheostomy placement with revision due to hypoxemia
   with trach blockage.  Patient has been using trach valve during the day
   and CMV at night.  Transfered for evaluation of posterior trach
   erosion, trach repositioned b IP.
   - continue vent settings over night, w/ valve during the day.  Although
   pt can talk around valve, which may portend need for trach replacement.
   - discourange ambient use
   - will d/w IP switch to non-flexible valve
   - cont guafenisin and duoneb
   - reduce lasix to [**Hospital1 **]
   - encourage weight loss and ? pulm rehab on discharge.
   # Severe Scoliosis:
   - cont protonix
   - tylenol for pain, holding narcotics from OSH as is not part of home
   regimen.
   # RV failure: likely due to mod pHTN (45mmHg) in the setting of OSA.
   Mild reduced RV function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of severe scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. He presented to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea and developed hypercapnic respiratory failure, necessitating semi-emergent tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently in the ICU for evaluation of posterior wall erosion. He has been using a tracheostomy valve during the day and CPAP/PSV mode at night. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight increase in heart rate. The patient's lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, and electrolytes. However, his creatinine and glucose levels are slightly elevated. Imaging reveals decreased lung volumes and increased opacification in the right lung, suggesting possible cardiac decompensation and retained secretions in the bronchial tree. There is also a suggestion of a right pleural effusion and indeterminate lung consolidation or atelectasis. The patient's current plan includes continuing ventilator settings, discouraging ambient oxygen use, switching to a non-flexible tracheostomy valve, and encouraging weight loss and pulmonary rehabilitation upon discharge. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent culture sampling from the tracheostomy site will be necessary to detect any signs of infection.

The patient has sinus tachycardia and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tracheostomy tube, set at a tidal volume of 230 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 50%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of [insert value], PaCO2 of [insert value], and PaO2 of [insert value]. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 790 mL and output of 4,390 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,600 mL. The patient's labs indicate a white blood cell count of 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, and glucose of 103 mg/dL. Imaging reveals decreased lung volumes and increased opacification in the right lung since the previous date. There is also evidence of vascular engorgement in the left lung, suggesting cardiac decompensation. Retained secretions in the bronchial tree, particularly on the right side, are also noted. A right pleural effusion has likely developed, and the right lower lung may be atelectatic or consolidated. The extent of presumed cardiomegaly is indeterminate. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is receiving ICU care. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac decompensation: The presence of vascular engorgement in the left lung and increased opacification in the right lung suggests cardiac involvement, which may lead to worsening heart failure.
2. Pneumonia: The increased opacification in the right lung and retained secretions in the bronchial tree indicate a potential infection, such as pneumonia.
3. Pleural effusion: The development of a right pleural effusion suggests fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which can compromise respiratory function.
4. Atelectasis: The possibility of atelectasis in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of severe scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. He presented to an outside hospital with worsening dyspnea and developed hypercapnic respiratory failure, requiring semi-emergent tracheostomy placement. He is now being transferred for evaluation of posterior wall erosion. The patient has been using a tracheostomy valve during the day and a CPAP machine at night. His current condition includes hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely secondary to both restrictive lung process due to severe scoliosis and additional OSA. He also has severe scoliosis, RV failure likely due to moderate pulmonary hypertension in the setting of OSA, and mild reduced RV function.

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with severe scoliosis initially admitted to [**Hospital **] on [**2155-11-20**] with increasing dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring semi-urgent tracheostomy. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for tracheostomy occlusion, and now the advancement of tracheostomy 1 cm has been done.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 104/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on tracheostomy mask with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient has inspiratory and expiratory wheezing in the respiratory/chest examination and 2+ symmetrical lower extremity edema.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, platelet count of 308 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, blood glucose of 103 mg/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride of 98 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.2 mg/dL, phosphate of 3.6 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.9 mg/dL. The prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time/information ratio is 11.8/1.0, respectively.

Imaging shows a chest X-ray taken on [**2156-12-2**] at 12:26 AM and [**2156-12-3**] at 04:45 AM.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation, possibly secondary to tracheostomy occlusion. The patient is doing well during the day with adjustable tracheostomy and requires ventilator support at night. The plan is to ask the patient if we can change to a non-adjustable tracheostomy as the position of tracheostomy has moved overnight. The patient is speaking without using [**Last Name (LF) 4579**], and [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] is keeping [**First Name3 (LF) 4579**] off for now.

The patient also has pulmonary hypertension likely due to restrictive lung disease, and lasix has been continued. An addendum notes that the tracheostomy was changed to [**Last Name (un) 2523**] 110mm, size 7, with the tip approximately 1 cm above the carina. The tracheostomy was uncomplicated, with severe subgl"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with severe scoliosis initially admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2155-11-20**] with increasing dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring a semi-urgent tracheostomy. The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for trach occlusion and is now advancing the trach 1cm. The patient is currently on AC overnight and TCM with intermittent use of [**Street Address(2) 4579**] during the day. Lasix was increased yesterday for volume overload on CXR, with a net output of 3.6L.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 36.6-37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/65 to 154/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 790/930 mL and total output of 4390/1330 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3600/400 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask on CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 230 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 12 cmH2"
