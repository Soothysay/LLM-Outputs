","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse who was admitted with fever, multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusions, subdural hemorrhage, nondisplaced occipital fracture, and epidural hematoma. The patient was intubated for airway protection and is currently extubated.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 158/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and has a standby ventilator mode.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, symmetrical chest expansion, crackles in the right lower lung fields, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows the patient responding to commands, moving all four extremities with withdrawal to pain, gag reflex present, and pupils sluggish and 4 mm in size.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 356 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, sodium of 107 mg/dL, potassium of 0.6 mg/dL, chloride of 31 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 28.5%, blood urea nitrogen of 94 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 107 mg/dL, and platelet count of 8.1 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include the following:

1. Traumatic Head Injury with Intraparenchymal bleed and subdural bleed: The patient is improving with weaned sedation. Neuro exam, BP/HR will be monitored for evidence of rising intracranial pressure. Repeat CT Head in the morning, continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and consult neurosurgery.

2. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved. A question of retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray is noted. The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to the seizure and fall. Continue levaquin/flagyl for likely aspiration, repeat CXR in the morning, and send blood cultures, urine culture. Trend fever curve, WBC.

3. Diastolic CHF: The patient is euvolemic on exam. Hold metoprolol overnight given low blood pressure with sedation. Hold ASA given bleed. Hold lasix for now. Continue simvastatin.

4. Chronic Pleural Effusions s/p VATS and decortication: Unclear if CXR change from baseline. Obtain OSH records.

5. COPD: Continue spiriva and albuterol.

6. EtOH Seizures: Unclear seizure history - pt on depakote as outpatient. Possible seizure focus related to"

   A/P: Pt is a 60y/o M with PMH of EtOH abuse admitted with fever,
   multifocal intraparenchymal hemmorhagic contusions, SDH, nondisplaced
   occipital fracture and epidural hematoma now intubated for airway
   protection.
   .
   # Traumatic Head Injury with Intraparenchymal bleed and subdural bleed
   - pt found s/p seizure per report, had mechanism significant enough for
   occipital frx. Evaluated by Neurosurgery with no indication for
   surgical intervention. Pt improved with wean of sedation yesterday. Tox
   screen negative. No evidence of ICP.  Repeat CT Head showed likely
   stable blood, redistribution, but no new acute bleed.
   - Continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, last level was 3.2
   - Call pharmacy to determine appropriate dosing
   - Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs
   - [**Hospital **] medical neurology regarding appropriate home seizure
   medication given complex hx of ETOH seizures and current ICB.
   .
   # C-spine: pt w/ negative c-spine CT, but endorsing midline TTP and
   pain on later movement. Pt will likely need to have ortho/spine f/u for
   consideration of MRI to assess for ligamentous injury.
   - Instructed to continue wearing neck brace
   - Consult Trauma surgery or Ortho/Spine to eval C-spine.
   .
   # Fever - Pt with temp to 102.8 on presentation to ED. WBC are normal
   have trended upwards. Currently afebrile. Question of retrocardiac
   opacity on CXR on presentation and high risk for aspiration event given
   seizure and fall led to initial treatment with Levo/Flagyl. No other
   focal finding.  Given data, and improved fevers after treatment, it is
   possible that an early aspiration PNA was treated.
   - Continue levaquin/flagyl for likely aspiration x 5 days.
   - F/u CXR tomorrow.
   - F/u cx data and trend WBC
   .
   # Diastolic CHF - euvolemic on exam.
   - Restarted metoprolol last night as did not want to induce BB
   withdrawl
   - Hold ASA given bleed
   - Hold lasix for now
   - Continue simvastatin
   .
   # Chronic Pleural Effusions s/p VATS and decortication - unclear if CXR
   change from baseline
   - obtain OSH recors

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse who was admitted with fever, multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusions, subdural hematoma, and a nondisplaced occipital fracture. The patient was intubated for airway protection. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), current temperature at 35.6Â°C (96Â°F), heart rate at 87 bpm with a range of 78-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/92 mmHg to 109/73 mmHg, respiratory rate at 21 breaths per minute with a range of 12-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. 

The patient has a soft mass measuring 1.5 x 1.5 cm in the right neck area, which is nontender. The patient also has irregularly irregular S1 with no murmurs, murmurs, or gallops. The patient's extremities show 2+ radial pulse and dorsalis pedis pulses, and the skin is described as warm and moist. 

The patient's neurological examination reveals intact cranial nerves II-XII, strength of 4/5 in both upper and lower extremities, and possibly decreased strength due to effort. 

Laboratory results indicate the following: white blood cell count ranging from 4"

   ICH
   CT appears to show layering but otherwise stable ICH.
   Follow final read of CTA of head
   Await neurosurgery input
   Seizure disorder
   Will ask neurology to comment on optimal anti-epileptic regimen in
   patient with new ICH, prior AED use, and possible liver disease.
   Neck
   Although his CT showed no fracture, he has a reasonable mechanism for
   ligamentous injury and he has ongoing tenderness.  Will discuss with
   neurosurgery or trauma
   Pneumonia
   Probable aspiration.  If fever recurs, add backs typical coverage.
   Alcohol abuse.
   Very high risk for alcohol withdrawal.  Thiamine/folate.  Follow with
   CIWA/Valium.
