   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 32F with Type 1 DM presenting with DKA.
   .
   # DKA
 Patient admitted with DKA. Elevated HgbA1c indicateds poor
   control of blood sugars, was previously followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**] but has not
   been seen recently. Gap was closed and bicarb had normalized somewhat
   but repeat labs this am show widened gap and decreased bicarb,
   worsening acidosis. She was also unable to tolerate POs with nausea and
   vomiting. Etiology appears to have been nonspecific illness causing N/V
   which have persisted, as pt reports adherence to her insulin and there
   is no other obvious source of infection. Per report pt does have a h/o
   insulin non-adherence. Other possible etiologies include infection
   although denies focal symptoms, does have elevated WBC but stable,
   afebrile.
   -- Will restart  insulin gtt at 4 units
   -- Continue PO challenge as tolerated
   -- DC SC insulin while on gtt
   -- q1-2h FSG
   -- q4-6h chemistries
   -- continue D51/2NS with K. Will recheck K at 10am
   -- reglan and zofran prn nausea
   -- [**Last Name (un) 276**] c/s
   -- will also check UA and urine cx to eval source of infxn given mod
   bacteria on UA, no prior cx
   .
   # Factor VIII inhibitor - s/p rituximab and steroids
   -- avoid sQ heparin, monitor for bleeding
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-25**] DKA, but other possible etiologies include
   diabetic gastroparesis. Given temporal association with DKA, most
   likely etiology.
   - prn Reglan, Zofran
   # Hypertension: Now normotensive but was hypertensive overnight.  Was
   likely [**2-25**] agitation, N/V. Will follow. No know prior h/o HTN and was
   not previously on any antihypertensives. She is young with no known h/o
   cardiovascular disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
- She has a history of poor blood sugar control, as indicated by an elevated HbA1c level.
- The patient was previously followed by a physician but had not been seen recently.
- She was admitted with DKA and required treatment.
- The patient experienced nausea and vomiting, making it difficult to tolerate oral intake.
- Despite adherence to insulin, the patient's blood sugar levels remained elevated.
- Other possible causes of her symptoms include infection, but she denies any focal symptoms and has a stable and afebrile condition.
- The patient's labs show a widened gap and decreased bicarbonate, indicating worsening acidosis.
- She has a history of insulin non-adherence.
- The plan is to restart an insulin drip, continue a trial of oral intake as tolerated, discontinue subcutaneous insulin while on the insulin drip, and monitor her blood sugar levels frequently.
- The patient will also be evaluated for possible sources of infection, including a urine culture.
- She should be monitored for any signs of bleeding due to a history of Factor VIII inhibitor, which has been treated with rituximab and steroids.
- The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to DKA or diabetic gastroparesis.
- Her blood pressure was previously elevated but is now within normal range.
- The patient is expected to follow a diabetic diet,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus who presented with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). She was admitted to the ICU for management and stabilization. The patient's condition improved, with closure of the gap and normalization of bicarbonate levels. Her most recent fingerstick glucose level was 84 mg/dL. The etiology of DKA appears to be a nonspecific illness causing nausea and vomiting, and the patient reports adherence to her insulin regimen without any other obvious source of infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient presented with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. It requires prompt medical attention and ICU admission for stabilization.
2. Factor VIII inhibitor - The patient has a history of Factor VIII inhibitor, which is an immune disorder affecting blood clotting. She has undergone treatment with rituximab and steroids. This condition requires careful monitoring and avoidance of specific medications that may cause bleeding complications.
3. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis - The patient is at an increased risk for blood clots due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium infusion are being used to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
4. Stress ulcer prophylaxis - PPI (pro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has a history of poor blood sugar control and was previously followed by Dr. [Last Name], but has not been seen recently. The patient was admitted with DKA and had an elevated HgbA1c indicating poor control of blood sugars. Her labs showed a widened gap and decreased bicarb, indicating worsening acidosis. She was unable to tolerate oral medications due to nausea and vomiting. The etiology of the nausea and vomiting is unclear, but it could be related to DKA or other possible causes such as infection. The patient has a history of insulin non-adherence, which may have contributed to the development of DKA. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient presented with DKA, a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. It requires immediate medical attention and can lead to complications such as cerebral edema, kidney damage, and heart problems if not treated promptly.
2. Hypoglycemia - Since the patient is on insulin, there is a risk of low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) due to over-treatment or mismatch in insulin administration and food intake.
3. Infection - Although the patient denies having any focal symptoms, her elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible underlying infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has an elevated HgbA1c indicating poor baseline control of blood sugars. The gap has closed and bicarbonate levels have normalized. The patient tolerated some oral intake with nausea and vomiting. The etiology appears to be nonspecific illness versus urinary tract infection (UTI) given the dirty urine analysis. The patient reports adherence to her insulin regimen, but there is no other obvious source of infection. She also has a history of insulin non-adherence.

   # DKA
 Patient admitted with DKA. Elevated HgbA1c indicates poor
   baseline control of blood sugars. Gap now closed and bicarb has
   normalized. She has tolerated some PO intake with some nausea and
   vomiting. Etiology appears to have been nonspecific illness vs. UTI
   given dirty UA . Pt reports adherence to her insulin and there is no
   other obvious source of infection. Per report pt also has h/o insulin
   non-adherence.

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was admitted to the ICU and received insulin gtt, which was overlapped with 14 units of lantus. Her blood glucose levels have been managed, and the gap has closed with normalized bicarbonate. She tolerated some oral intake but experienced nausea and vomiting. The etiology of DKA appears to be nonspecific illness versus urinary tract infection (UTI) due to dirty urinalysis. The patient reports adherence to her insulin regimen, and there is no other obvious source of infection. She has a history of insulin non-adherence.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Due to the administration of insulin and sliding scale, there is a risk of hypoglycemia.
2. Infection: Although the patient is being treated for an uncomplicated UTI, other potential infections should be monitored and evaluated.
3. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting may persist or recur, requiring further management.
4. Hypertension: The patient was mildly hypertensive overnight, which could be related to agitation and nausea. It will be monitored and managed accordingly.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,688 mL since 12 AM. This may indicate ongoing fluid loss or inadequate fluid intake.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: Close monitoring of"
