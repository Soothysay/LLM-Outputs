   Assessment and Plan
   49F with prescribed desipramine at home found with altered mental
   status at home with likely TCA overdose.
   .
   #. TCA overdose: Likely cause of her altered mental status on
   presentation given positive serum tox screen, and empty bottles in
   apartment. Serum tox negative for benzos, but unclear if patient also
   overdosed on other substances. Patient with evidence of both
   cardiotoxicity with widened QRS, and neurotoxicity with myoclonus,
   hyper-reflexia.
   - Toxicology recs obtained in ED which were as follows:
   -Continuing HCO3- drip at 150-200 cc/hr with goal ph 7.5-> 7.53 but
   would not hyperventilate to reach these goals.
   -If arrythmia occurs pls call tox fellow and consider using lidocaine
   -sx will likely resolve in 24 hrs. start to wean HCO3 in AM as QRS
   morphology returns to normal.
   .
   Plan:
   - Toxocology following, appreciate recs
   - Q4hr lytes and repletion- watching for AG, bicarb, and lytes such as
   calcium (at risk for hypocalcemia), Mg Phos, replete as needed
   - continue bicarb gtt overnight with goal pH 7.5-7.53
   - switch propofol to midazolam and fentanyl  as benzos would be
   treatment of choice for neurotoxicity
   - repeat Q2hr ABGs including lactate and free calcium
   - repeat Q2hr EKGs - watch closely for QT interval, QRS complex - when
   QRS intervals longer than 100ms pts are at risk for seizures, with
   intervals >160ms are at risk for arrhythmias. - if arrythmia, chose
   lidocaine. QRS interval is evaluated best using the limb leads
   - Q4hr neuro checks, monitoring closely for hyperreflexia or signs of
   seizures. Do thorough neuro exam once patient less sedated.
   - send urine tox - including salicylate and acetaminophen to rule out
   co-ingestion
   - CT head to r/o bleed
   - continue intubated for now, but when more stable, can start weaning
   down sedation and off vent
   - no therapeutic or prognostic utility to checking serum or urine TCA
   levels per literature
   - monitor on telemetry
   - try to obtain outside PCP records in AM about other medications or
   medical history
   .
   # Hypotension/shock: Likely [**3-17**] effects from TCA overdose. Started on
   neosynephrine in ED.
   - continue fluids and neosynephrine to keep MAP>65. If second [**Doctor Last Name **]
   needed, will try levophed
   .
   #. Anemia - guiac positive brown stool in ED, NG lavage negative. Hct
   27. Unknown baseline Hct.
   - monitor for bleeding
   - trend Hct Q6hr
   - send iron studies
   - maintain active T/C
   - 3 large PIVs, and femoral line
   - continue to guiac stools
   .
   #. Depression/psych history
   - hold other psych meds
   - social work consult when awake
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's - 16, 18, 18, femoral line. Will need to replace femoral
   line with IJ or subclavian CVL in AM.
   .
   CODE STATUS: Presumed full, will try to contact friends/family in AM.
   Unable to obtain ICU consent overnight.
   .
   EMERGENCY CONTACT: Unknown family or friend contacts
   .
   DISPOSITION: ICU care for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old female who was found with altered mental status at home. She has a history of prescribed desipramine use and is suspected to have overdosed on tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

24-hour events include unsuccessful attempts to place an arterial line, phenylephrine being weaned down, and levophed being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 116/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.5%, platelet count of 245 K/uL, total CO2 of 24-28 mmol/L, sodium of 135-145 meq/L, potassium of 3.5-5.0 meq/L, chloride of 98-106 meq/L, bicarbonate of 22-28 meq/L, magnesium of 1.7-2.2 mg/dL, phosphate of 2.5-4.5 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.5-10."

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with prescribed desipramine at home found with altered mental
   status at home with likely TCA overdose.
   .
   #. TCA overdose: Likely cause of her altered mental status on
   presentation given positive serum tox screen, and empty bottles in
   apartment. Serum tox negative for benzos, but unclear if patient also
   overdosed on other substances. Patient with evidence of both
   cardiotoxicity with widened QRS, and neurotoxicity with myoclonus,
   hyper-reflexia.
   - Toxicology recs obtained in ED which were as follows:
   -Continuing HCO3- drip at 150-200 cc/hr with goal ph 7.5-> 7.53 but
   would not hyperventilate to reach these goals, call give [**2-14**] amps push
   prn.
   -If arrythmia occurs pls call tox fellow and consider using lidocaine
   -sx will likely resolve in 24 hrs of admission
   -once qrs narrow can wean bicarb and check serial ekgs
   .
   Plan:
   - Toxocology following, appreciate recs
   - follow lytes, HCT, serial ABGs, lactate, free calcium
   - continue bicarb gtt  with goal pH 7.5-7.53
   -CT of the head as unsure if had trauma to look for bleed
   - rfollow EKGs - watch closely for QT interval, QRS complex - when QRS
   intervals longer than 100ms pts are at risk for seizures, with
   intervals >160ms are at risk for arrhythmias. - if arrythmia, chose
   lidocaine. QRS interval is evaluated best using the limb leads
   - Q4hr neuro checks, monitoring closely for hyperreflexia or signs of
   seizures.
   - Do thorough neuro exam once patient less sedated.
   - continue intubated for now, but when more stable, can start weaning
   down sedation and off vent
   - no therapeutic or prognostic utility to checking serum or urine TCA
   levels per literature
   - monitor on telemetry
   - try to obtain outside PCP records in AM about other medications or
   medical history
   -EEG if become concerned about ? seizure
   .
   # Hypotension/shock: Likely [**3-17**] effects from TCA overdose.
   -wean levophed as tolerated and neosynephrine
   -to keep MAP>65.
   ..
   #. Anemia - guiac positive brown stool in ED, NG lavage negative. Hct
   27. Unknown baseline Hct.
   - monitor for bleeding
   - trend Hct
   - maintain active T/C
   - 3 large PIVs, and femoral line, may need central line
   - continue to guiac stools
   .
   #. Depression/psych history
   - hold other psych meds, try to contact psychiatrist
   -psych c/s
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's - 16, 18, 18, femoral line. Will need to replace femoral
   line with IJ or subclavian CVL in AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with suicide attempt/TCA overdose.
   TCA OVERDOSE --  has neuro and cardiac toxicity, with EKG changes and
   myoclonus.  Overall myoclonus gradually resolving.  Continue Bicarb gtt
   to maintain pH 7.5-7.55.  Check serial EKG's to track QRS morphology
   changes- QRS duration normalizing.  Monitor serial electrolytes.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --   Evidence for interval devlopment of LLL
   infiltrate.  Oxygenation and ventilation adequate on PEEP 5, FiO2 50%.
   Continue ventilator support.
   LLL INFILTRATE -- concern for aspiration or evolving aspiration
   pneumonia.  Close monitoring, low threshold for antimicrobials.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to TCA overdose.  Benzodiazepine
   infusion.  Monitor.  Consider EEG (continuous) to exclude status.
   SHOCK- suspect from TCA overdose - on neo infusion for MAP>65. If
   required, add levophed.
    ANEMIA -- unknown chronicity. Was guiac positive, though no overt
   bleeding and NG was negative.  Monitor serial Hct's.
   SUICIDE ATTEMPT -- will need 1:1 24-hr sitter and Psychiatry evaluation
   once awakens.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female who attempted suicide and overdosed on tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of interval development of left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate, which may indicate aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring and low threshold for antimicrobials are recommended.

2. Shock: The patient is suspected to be in shock due to TCA overdose and is being treated with vasopressor infusions, specifically neosinephrine, to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. If required, levophed may be added.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is attributed to TCA overdose. Benzodiazepine infusion is being used for sedation, and continuous EEG monitoring is considered to exclude status epilepticus.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of unknown chronicity. Guaiac positive results suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, although overt bleeding is not observed. Serial Hct monitoring is advised.

5. Suicide attempt: The patient's suicide attempt requires a 1:1 24-hour sitter and psychiatric evaluation once she awakens.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction and requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications."

   49 yo female with suicide attempt/TCA overdose.
   TCA OVERDOSE --  has neuro and cardiac toxicity, with EKG changes and
   myoclonus.  Overall myoclonus gradually resolving.  Continue Bicarb gtt
   to maintain pH 7.5-7.55.  Check serial EKG's to track QRS morphology
   changes- QRS duration normalizing.  Monitor serial electrolytes.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --   Evidence for interval devlopment of LLL
   infiltrate.  Oxygenation and ventilation adequate on PEEP 5, FiO2 50%.
   Continue ventilator support.
   LLL INFILTRATE -- concern for aspiration or evolving aspiration
   pneumonia.  Close monitoring, low threshold for antimicrobials.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to TCA overdose.  Benzodiazepine
   infusion.  Monitor.  Consider EEG (continuous) to exclude status.
   SHOCK- suspect from TCA overdose - on neo infusion for MAP>65. If
   required, add levophed.
    ANEMIA -- unknown chronicity. Was guiac positive, though no overt
   bleeding and NG was negative.  Monitor serial Hct's.
   SUICIDE ATTEMPT -- will need 1:1 24-hr sitter and Psychiatry evaluation
   once awakens.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female who is critically ill in the ICU. She remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient is on neosinephrine vasopressor and HCO3 infusion. She has a history of suicide attempt and TCA overdose, which has caused neuro and cardiac toxicity with EKG changes and myoclonus. The myoclonus is gradually resolving, and she is being monitored for serial EKG's and electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already being managed with mechanical ventilation. Monitoring oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. LLL Infiltrate/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has developed a left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate, which raises concerns for aspiration or evolving aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring and a low threshold for antimicrobials will be necessary to prevent or treat this complication.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is attributed to TCA overdose. Benzodiazepine infusion is being administered, and continuous EEG monitoring should be considered to exclude status epilepticus.
4. Shock: The patient is suspected to be in shock due to TCA overdose. She is on neo infusion for maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. If required, levophed can be added to manage this complication.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female who was found down after a suspected desipramine overdose. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/58 mmHg to 125/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus with occasional myoclonic jerking, which is being treated with midazolam.

The patient has a prolonged QRS interval on EKG, but it has plateaued at around 130 ms and is not improving. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, hemoglobin levels are slightly low, and platelet count is normal. Renal function tests show a slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been relatively stable, ranging from 99 to 161 mg/dL. Liver function tests are within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are also within normal ranges.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. QRS prolongation: The patient has a prolonged QRS interval, which may be due to the overdose of desipramine. It is important to monitor the patient's EKG and consider adjusting the bicarbonate drip if necessary. If"

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with prescribed desipramine at home found with altered mental
   status at home with likely TCA overdose.
   .
   #. TCA overdose: Likely cause of her altered mental status on
   presentation given positive serum tox screen, and empty bottles in
   apartment. Serum tox negative for benzos, but unclear if patient also
   overdosed on other substances. Patient with evidence of both
   cardiotoxicity with widened QRS, and neurotoxicity with myoclonus,
   hyper-reflexia.
   - Toxicology recs obtained in ED which were as follows:
   -Continuing HCO3- drip at 150-200 cc/hr with goal ph 7.5-> 7.53 but
   would not hyperventilate to reach these goals, call give [**2-14**] amps push
   prn.
   -If arrythmia occurs pls call tox fellow and consider using lidocaine
   -sx will likely resolve in 24 hrs of admission
   -once qrs narrow can wean bicarb and check serial ekgs
   .
   Plan:
   - Toxocology following, appreciate recs
   - follow lytes, HCT, serial ABGs, lactate, free calcium
   - continue bicarb gtt  with goal pH 7.5-7.53
   -CT of the head as unsure if had trauma to look for bleed
   - rfollow EKGs - watch closely for QT interval, QRS complex - when QRS
   intervals longer than 100ms pts are at risk for seizures, with
   intervals >160ms are at risk for arrhythmias. - if arrythmia, chose
   lidocaine. QRS interval is evaluated best using the limb leads
   - Q4hr neuro checks, monitoring closely for hyperreflexia or signs of
   seizures.
   - Do thorough neuro exam once patient less sedated.
   - continue intubated for now, but when more stable, can start weaning
   down sedation and off vent
   - no therapeutic or prognostic utility to checking serum or urine TCA
   levels per literature
   - monitor on telemetry
   - try to obtain outside PCP records in AM about other medications or
   medical history
   -EEG if become concerned about ? seizure
   .
   # Hypotension/shock: Likely [**3-17**] effects from TCA overdose.
   -wean levophed as tolerated and neosynephrine
   -to keep MAP>65.
   ..
   #. Anemia - guiac positive brown stool in ED, NG lavage negative. Hct
   27. Unknown baseline Hct.
   - monitor for bleeding
   - trend Hct
   - maintain active T/C
   - 3 large PIVs, and femoral line, may need central line
   - continue to guiac stools
   .
   #. Depression/psych history
   - hold other psych meds, try to contact psychiatrist
   -psych c/s
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's - 16, 18, 18, femoral line. Will need to replace femoral
   line with IJ or subclavian CVL in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of depression who was found with altered mental status at home. She had been prescribed desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which is believed to be the cause of her altered mental status. The patient tested positive for TCA overdose and had empty bottles of desipramine in her apartment. She also showed signs of cardiotoxicity with a widened QRS complex and neurotoxicity with myoclonus and hyper-reflexia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, blood pressure ranging from 100/58 mmHg to 125/92 mmHg, heart rate between 70 and 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O. Her blood gases show a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 234. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), creatinine (Cr), troponin T, and lactate. Her electrolyte levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with suicide attempt/TCA overdose.
   TCA OVERDOSE --  evidence for neuro and cardiac toxicity, with EKG
   changes and myoclonus.  Overall myoclonus gradually resolving.
   Continue Bicarb gtt to maintain pH 7.5-7.55.  Check serial EKG's to
   track QRS morphology changes- QRS duration variable.  Monitor serial
   electrolytes.  Toxicology Consultant following.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --   Evidence for interval devlopment of LLL
   infiltrate, now progressed to bilateral lower lung field densities --
   suspect bilateral pleural effusions.  Oxygenation and ventilation
   adequate on PEEP 5, FiO2 50%. Continue ventilator support.
   LLL INFILTRATE -- concern for aspiration or evolving aspiration
   pneumonia.  Close monitoring, low threshold for antimicrobials as at
   risk for pneumonia.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to TCA overdose.  Benzodiazepine
   infusion.  Monitor.  Consider EEG (continuous) to exclude status
   epilepticus.
   SHOCK- suspect from TCA overdose --> now off vasopressors.  Resolved.
   Monitor BP.
   ANEMIA -- unknown chronicity. Was guiac positive, though no overt
   bleeding and NG was negative.  Monitor serial Hct's.
   FLUIDS -- dramatic net positive.  Desire continued HCO3 drip, but hope
   to see net diuresis.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor creat, BUN, UO.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete
   ILEUS -- likely related to TCA overdose.  Monitor exam.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- hope to initiate TF, but may be limited by
   ileus.
   SUICIDE ATTEMPT -- will need 1:1 24-hr sitter and Psychiatry evaluation
   once awakens.

   49F found down s/p desipramine OD, currently
   .
   #s/p TCA overdose:  Patient now 48-72 hours s/p ingestion.  On
   levophed.  QRS duration has been stable and is approx 130ms.  Patient
   was weaned on bicarb gtt yesterday.  Patient is still having myoclonic
   jerks while on Midazolam (unclear if patient is having seizure);
   patient being weaned from Midazolam.  No need for further VBGs.
   Patient persistently hypotensive, on low dose of levophed.  Patient had
   EEG yesterday, unread.
   - Per [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] d/c Bicarb gtt and recheck EKG 30mins post
   - [**Hospital1 7**] EKGs
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - f/u EEG, consider Neuro consult.

   # Aspiration Pneumonia, suspected:  TMax 101.4 this AM.  Patient has no
   definite source for infection, but had a LLL questionable infiltrate
   that may have been related to aspiration pneumonia on presentation.
   Patient
s CXR last night was c/w fluid overload.  Mindful that if
   having trouble weaning patient from levophed, sepsis should be
   considered if persistently febrile.
   - Start Vancomycin/CTX
   - f/u BCx, sputum if available
   # Respiratory:  Patient s/p elective intubation with increasing oxygen
   requirement, currently on 100%.  Patient
s CXR c/w overload, as patient
   is 19L positive for LOS and is volume overloaded on exam.  Patient has
   had good urine output and it is likely that her increasing oxygen
   requirement is from the large volume of fluid she received +/- presumed
   LLL Aspiration PNA.
   - Hold fluids, allow patient to autodiurese
   #Bipolar disorder/Depression:  Patient has no history of prior sucide
   attempts.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] covering psychiatrist; will contact [**Name (NI) 1**] team once
   chart reviewed.
   - psyc to follow when able to speak
   #Ileus: likely [**3-17**] anticholinergic effect of TCA.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female who was found down after an overdose of desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated. 

The patient's QRS duration is approximately 130 ms, indicating TCA-induced cardiotoxicity. The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and she is currently on 50% FiO2. Her chest X-ray is consistent with pulmonary congestion, which may be due to fluid overload. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature (Tmax: 38.1°C or 100.6°F) and a heart rate within normal limits (HR: 78 bpm). Her blood pressure is on the lower side (BP: 115/63 mmHg). Her respiratory rate is normal (RR: 21 insp/min), and her oxygen saturation is 95%. 

The patient is sedated and nonresponsive, with twitching of extremities and head randomly and in association with stimuli. Her pupils are equal and reactive to light, but she exhibits vertical and horizontal nystagmus. 

The patient has mild crackles in her lungs, soft and mildly distended abdomen with no bowel sounds, and edema in both upper and lower extremities. Neurological examination reveals 2+ knee reflexes bilaterally and 2 beats of clonus in feet bilaterally.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with suicide attempt/TCA overdose.
   TCA OVERDOSE --  Continues to exhibit evidence for neuro and cardiac
   toxicity, with EKG changes and myoclonus.  Overall myoclonus gradually
   improving.  Continue Bicarb gtt to maintain pH 7.5-7.55.  Check serial
   EKG's to track QRS morphology changes- QRS duration variable.  Monitor
   serial electrolytes.  Toxicology Consultant following.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Evidence for interval devlopment of LLL
   infiltrate, now progressed to bilateral lower lung field densities --
   suspect bilateral pleural effusions.  Oxygenation and ventilation
   adequate on PEEP 5, FiO2 60%. Continue ventilator support.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to volume overload (resussitation), but also
   consider progression of LLL infiltrate (probable aspiration pneumonia).
   LLL INFILTRATE -- concern for aspiration or evolving aspiration
   pneumonia.  Close monitoring, low threshold for antimicrobials as at
   risk for pneumonia.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to TCA overdose.  Benzodiazepine
   infusion.  Monitor.  Consider EEG (continuous) to exclude status
   epilepticus.
   SHOCK- suspect from TCA overdose.  Now back on vasopressors.  Concern
   for medicatoin effect, or evolving sepsis.
   ANEMIA -- unknown chronicity. Was guiac positive, though no overt
   bleeding and NG was negative.  Monitor serial Hct's.
   FLUIDS -- dramatic net positive.  Desire to discontinued HCO3 drip -->
   now desire net diuresis.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor creat, BUN, UO.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   ILEUS -- likely related to TCA overdose.  Should resolve.  Bowel
   regimen.  Monitor exam.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- hope to initiate TF, but may be limited by
   ileus.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 49-year-old female admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. She continues to exhibit myoclonus, indicating ongoing neurotoxicity from the TCA overdose. The EKG changes and myoclonus suggest cardiac toxicity as well. Serial electrolytes and EKG's are being monitored, and a toxicology consultant has been called in.

The patient's respiratory status has worsened with the development of bilateral lower lung field densities, suggesting bilateral pleural effusions. Ventilator support is ongoing with PEEP at 5 and FiO2 at 60%. The hypoxemia is attributed to volume overload from resuscitation efforts, but there is also concern for progression of LLL infiltrate, likely due to aspiration pneumonia.

The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, which is attributed to the TCA overdose. Benzodiazepine infusion has been initiated, and an EEG is being considered to exclude status epilepticus.

There is suspicion of shock, possibly due to the TCA overdose or evolving sepsis. Vasopressors have been restarted. The patient has anemia of unknown chronicity, and the guaiac positive result was likely a false positive. Serial Hct's are being monitored, and there is a desire to discontinue the HCO3 drip and initiate a net diuresis.

Renal function is preserved, and creatinine, BUN, and UO"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with suicide attempt/TCA overdose.
   TCA OVERDOSE --  Continues to exhibit evidence for neuro and cardiac
   toxicity, with EKG changes and myoclonus.  Overall myoclonus gradually
   improving.  Continue Bicarb gtt to maintain pH 7.5-7.55.  Check serial
   EKG's to track QRS morphology changes- QRS duration variable.  Monitor
   serial electrolytes.  Toxicology Consultant following.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Evidence for interval devlopment of LLL
   infiltrate, now progressed to bilateral lower lung field densities --
   suspect bilateral pleural effusions.  Oxygenation and ventilation
   adequate on PEEP 5, FiO2 60%. Continue ventilator support.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to volume overload (resussitation), but also
   consider progression of LLL infiltrate (probable aspiration pneumonia).
   LLL INFILTRATE -- concern for aspiration or evolving aspiration
   pneumonia.  Close monitoring, low threshold for antimicrobials as at
   risk for pneumonia.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to TCA overdose.  Benzodiazepine
   infusion.  Monitor.  Consider EEG (continuous) to exclude status
   epilepticus.
   SHOCK- suspect from TCA overdose.  Now back on vasopressors.  Concern
   for medicatoin effect, or evolving sepsis.
   ANEMIA -- unknown chronicity. Was guiac positive, though no overt
   bleeding and NG was negative.  Monitor serial Hct's.
   FLUIDS -- dramatic net positive.  Desire to discontinued HCO3 drip -->
   now desire net diuresis.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor creat, BUN, UO.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   ILEUS -- likely related to TCA overdose.  Should resolve.  Bowel
   regimen.  Monitor exam.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- hope to initiate TF, but may be limited by
   ileus.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She remains intubated and mechanically ventilated with higher FiO2. The patient continues to exhibit myoclonus, indicating neurotoxicity. An EEG has been performed, and a toxicology consultant is following the case. The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with EKG changes indicating potential cardiac toxicity.

The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, with evidence of bilateral lower lung field densities, suggesting bilateral pleural effusions. Oxygenation and ventilation are being managed with PEEP 5 and FiO2 60%. There is concern for aspiration pneumonia due to the progression of the LLL infiltrate.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to TCA overdose. A benzodiazepine infusion has been started, and continuous EEG monitoring is being considered to exclude status epilepticus.

The patient was in shock, which may be attributed to TCA overdose or evolving sepsis. Vasopressors have been resumed, and fluid management is a concern due to the dramatic net positive fluid balance. The desire is to discontinue the HCO3 drip and achieve net diuresis.

The patient has anemia, likely of unknown chronicity, as evidenced by a positive guiac test. Serial Hct's will be monitored.

Renal function is preserved, but close monitoring of creatinine, BUN, and UO is"

   49F found down s/p desipramine OD, currently
   .
   #s/p TCA overdose:  Patient now 48-72 hours s/p ingestion.  On
   levophed.  QRS duration has been stable and is approx 130ms.  Patient
   was weaned on bicarb gtt yesterday.  Patient is still having myoclonic
   jerks while on Midazolam (unclear if patient is having seizure);
   patient being weaned from Midazolam.  No need for further VBGs.
   Patient persistently hypotensive, on low dose of levophed.  Patient had
   EEG yesterday, unread.
   - Per [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] d/c Bicarb gtt and recheck EKG 30mins post
   - [**Hospital1 7**] EKGs
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - f/u EEG, consider Neuro consult.

   # Aspiration Pneumonia, suspected:  TMax 101.4 this AM.  Patient has no
   definite source for infection, but had a LLL questionable infiltrate
   that may have been related to aspiration pneumonia on presentation.
   Patient
s CXR last night was c/w fluid overload.  Mindful that if
   having trouble weaning patient from levophed, sepsis should be
   considered if persistently febrile.
   - Start Vancomycin/CTX
   - f/u BCx, sputum if available
   # Respiratory:  Patient s/p elective intubation with increasing oxygen
   requirement, currently on 100%.  Patient
s CXR c/w overload, as patient
   is 19L positive for LOS and is volume overloaded on exam.  Patient has
   had good urine output and it is likely that her increasing oxygen
   requirement is from the large volume of fluid she received +/- presumed
   LLL Aspiration PNA.
   - Hold fluids, allow patient to autodiurese
   #Bipolar disorder/Depression:  Patient has no history of prior sucide
   attempts.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] covering psychiatrist; will contact [**Name (NI) 1**] team once
   chart reviewed.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old female who was found down after an overdose of desipramine, a type of tricyclic antidepressant. She has been in the ICU for several days and has developed multiple medical complications.

1. Respiratory Complication: The patient has shown increasing oxygen requirements and has been placed on a ventilator. Her chest X-ray indicates fluid overload, suggesting potential acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She also has a large volume of fluid received, which may contribute to her respiratory distress.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a suspected aspiration pneumonia due to a questionable infiltrate in the left lower lobe of her lungs. This could be related to aspiration of gastric contents during her altered mental status.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been persistently hypotensive and is on low-dose levophed (norepinephrine), indicating possible sepsis or poor cardiac output.

4. Myoclonic Jerks: The patient is experiencing myoclonic jerks while on midazolam, suggesting possible seizures or status epilepticus. However, the exact nature of her seizures is unclear.

5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an abnormal electrolyte panel, with low potassium levels (3.2 mEq/L) and low magnesium levels (1.8 mg/dL). These imbalances need to be corrected to avoid complications.

6. Anemia: The patient has a positive"
