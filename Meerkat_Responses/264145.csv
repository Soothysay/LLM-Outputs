","The patient is a 34-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has undergone surgery. Currently, the patient is intubated and unresponsive to any stimulus, with fixed and dilated pupils. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 92/63 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR: 150 bpm). The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 298 mmHg, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 2.2, suggesting ventilator dependence.

The patient's physical examination reveals no posturing, distended abdomen, and cool extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), troponin T, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate levels, along with low platelet count (Plt) and albumin levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for low potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels.

   with high FIO2 requirements (80%).  Lactate trending down.
   At [**2168**] hrs, pt brady'ed and went into PEA arrest --> CPR started,
   given atropine x 1, epi x 1, came out of arrest into sinus tach, BP
   220s after 3-4 mins of PEA arrest.
   Called by neuro fellow, stating that pt may be in non-convulsive
   status.  Explained that pt was just PEA arrested, and was given CPR.
   Told that pt
s EEG is flat lining.
   Head CT and CTA ordered to look for worsening cerebreal edema, ?PE.
   Head CT shows ventricles are slightly smaller in size compared with the
   morning head ct suggesting progression of cerebral edema, although lot
   of artifact on study from MRI leads.  Chest CT shows bilateral
   infiltrates could be c/w aspiration pneumonia, no pulmonary embolus
   although one small area in the LLL subsegmental branch that could be
   c/w PE.  He was started on vanc/zosyn to cover for aspiration
   pneumonia.  In addition, one set of blood cultures returned with both
   bottles with GPC's in pairs, second set with no growth thus far.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a past medical history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. He was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation. The patient is currently intubated, unresponsive, and on an Arctic sun cooling protocol due to diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT scan.

The patient experienced Wenckebach rhythm, with blood pressures correlating with cuff pressures. He also had a head CT showing diffuse anoxic brain injury. An EEG was done, but the results are not mentioned. The patient required high FIO2 requirements (80%) and lactate is trending down.

At [**2168**] hours, the patient bradied and went into PEA arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started, and medications such as atropine and epinephrine were given. The patient came out of arrest into sinus tachycardia with blood pressures in the 220s after a few minutes of PEA arrest.

A neuro fellow called, suggesting that the patient may be in non-convulsive status. The physician explained that the patient had just experienced PEA arrest and was given CPR. The fellow mentioned that the patient's EEG is flat lining.

Head CT and CTA were ordered to look for worsening cerebral edema and possible pulmonary embolus. The head CT showed ventricles that are slightly smaller"

   of artifact on study from MRI leads.  Chest CT shows bilateral
   infiltrates could be c/w aspiration pneumonia, no pulmonary embolus
   although one small area in the LLL subsegmental branch that could be
   c/w PE.  He was started on vanc/zosyn to cover for aspiration
   pneumonia.  In addition, one set of blood cultures returned with both
   bottles with GPC's in pairs, second set with no growth thus far.

   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.

   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. He was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT scan.

The patient has experienced several medical complications, including hypotension (not shock), hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage (anoxic encephalopathy, hypoxic ischemic), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cerebral edema, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. 

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 92/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and unresponsive to any stimulus. His pupils are fixed and dilated at 6mm bilaterally. The right pupil appears to be post-surgical, while the left eye has a large cataract visible. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of lactic acid, troponin-T, CK, CKMB, ALT, AST, and Alk Phos. His blood glucose level is within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension (not shock), hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. He was admitted to the CCU following a prolonged cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) and resuscitation. The patient is currently on an Arctic sun cooling protocol with diffuse anoxic brain injury observed on a CT scan.

The patient experienced Wenckebach rhythm, with blood pressures correlating with cuff pressures. He also had a head CT showing diffuse anoxic brain injury. An EEG was performed, and the patient required high FIO2 requirements (80%). Lactate levels are trending down.

The patient bradycarded and went into PEA arrest again, prompting CPR. Atropine and epinephrine were administered, and the patient emerged from the arrest with sinus tachycardia. Blood pressures were in the 220s after the event.

Head CT and CTA were ordered to assess for worsening cerebral edema and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). The head CT showed slightly smaller ventricular sizes compared to the morning scan, suggesting progression of cerebral edema. A chest CT revealed bilateral infiltrates, which could indicate aspiration pneumonia. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus, although a small area in the left lower lobe showed a possible PE. The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn to cover for aspiration pneumonia.

Blood cultures were obtained, with one set showing growth"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. He was admitted to the CCU following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and resuscitation. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage, and ventricular fibrillation (VF). The hypotension is attributed to autonomic instability and labile blood pressures, which the patient has a history of. 

The hypoxemia is likely due to a possible aspiration event, as evidenced by a new left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. Other potential causes such as pulmonary embolism have been considered but not confirmed.

The impaired skin integrity may be a result of prolonged immobility and pressure sores from being intubated and unresponsive.

Anoxic brain damage is evident from a global anoxic injury on head CT, likely caused by the prolonged PEA arrest. The cooling protocol has been initiated to prevent further brain damage.

Ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred during the arrest but was successfully managed.

Other lab abnormalities include elevated lactate levels, likely due to the prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion, as well as transaminitis, which may be an ischemic insult.

The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, and he is being monitored closely for any changes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. He was admitted to the CCU after experiencing a PEA arrest and resuscitation. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage, ventricular fibrillation, and urinary retention. He has been treated with dopamine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 150 bpm, blood pressure of 107/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on 100% FiO2, and temperature of 34 degrees Celsius. His physical examination reveals fixed and dilated pupils, cool extremities, distended abdomen, positive bowel sounds, and no jugular venous distension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed bilateral infiltrates on chest CT, which could indicate aspiration pneumonia. This is further supported by the presence of large cataracts and impaired swallowing reflexes.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although there is no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram, a subsegmental branch opacity seen on CT suggests the possibility of PE. Further evaluation with a CT angiography (CTA) may be necessary"

   Went into wenckebach rhythm. A-lined and BP correlating with cuff
   pressures.  Head CT showing diffuse anoxic brain injury.  EEG done. Pt
   with high FIO2 requirements (80%).  Lactate trending down.
   At [**2168**] hrs, pt brady'ed and went into PEA arrest --> CPR started,
   given atropine x 1, epi x 1, came out of arrest into sinus tach, BP
   220s after 3-4 mins of PEA arrest.
   Called by neuro fellow, stating that pt may be in non-convulsive
   status.  Explained that pt was just PEA arrested, and was given CPR.
   Told that pt
s EEG is flat lining.
   Head CT and CTA ordered to look for worsening cerebreal edema, ?PE.
   Head CT shows ventricles are slightly smaller in size compared with the
   morning head ct suggesting progression of cerebral edema, although lot
   of artifact on study from MRI leads.  Chest CT shows bilateral
   infiltrates could be c/w aspiration pneumonia, no pulmonary embolus
   although one small area in the LLL subsegmental branch that could be
   c/w PE.  He was started on vanc/zosyn to cover for aspiration
   pneumonia.  In addition, one set of blood cultures returned with both

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including Piperacillin and Vancomycin. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is experiencing hypotension and hypoxemia. He also has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for anoxic brain damage due to hypoxic ischemic injury. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 42, PaO2 of 179, and HCO3- of 26. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is slightly elevated at 8.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) is 38.2%, platelet count (Plt) is 148 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) is 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T is 0.29 ng/mL, and blood glucose is 132 mg/dL. The patient has elevated levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and abnormal kidney function (elevated BUN and creatinine). The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low magnesium (Mg++) levels. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 66 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 92/63 mmH"

   24 Hour Events:
   There is indecisiveness among family members about his code status, but
   the decision was made yesterday to make the patient DNR/DNI.  The
   family would like another family meeting today to update them on any
   progress in order to make any further decisions about proceeding with
   de-escalation of care.  Neuro says to continue 72 hours of EEG
   monitoring, but have little hope for any functional recovery.  Blood

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   -d/c amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   -on artic sun cooling protocol x18 hours, monitor coagulation profile
   -PEA arrested overnight again, with unclear precipitant, but suspected
   to be related to progressive cerebral edema.
   -Head CT concerning for smaller ventricular size, ?worsening cerebral
   edema, no obvious herniation
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -trend CE's to peak
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol
   -low dose fentanyl/versed advised by cardiac arrest consult in case he
   is in a locked in state (can likely stop when warmed)
   - neurology consult in the am
   -48 hour EEG (showing flat line as per neuro)
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down, currently 2.2
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   -monitor trend
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output
   .
   #Urinary retention - chronic indwelling foley catheter, await urine cx.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, NGT in place, change to OGT if prolonged intubation,
   replete lytes prn, consider starting tube feeds in the AM

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. He was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT scan. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia from possible aspiration event, lactic acidosis likely due to prolonged PEA arrest in the field, and transaminitis likely due to ischemic insult. He is also experiencing urinary retention and autonomic instability with labile blood pressures. The patient's DNR/DNI status is being discussed with the family for possible terminal extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is due to a possible aspiration event. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has diffuse anoxic brain injury, which can result in permanent neurological damage and loss of brainstem reflexes.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis is likely due to prolonged PEA arrest in the field. If not treated promptly, it can progress to severe metabolic acidosis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is likely due to an ischemic insult. It should be closely monitored for any signs of liver dysfunction.
5. Autonomic Instability: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures.
- He was admitted to the CCU following a prolonged cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) and resuscitation.
- The patient is currently intubated and unresponsive to any stimulus.
- Neurological examination shows fixed and dilated pupils bilaterally, with no appreciable murmur on cardiovascular examination.
- Chest X-ray reveals left-sided effusion, bilateral atelectasis with superimposed infiltrates, likely due to aspiration.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient has been cooled using the Arctic sun cooling protocol but has been rewarmed now.
- He is currently on dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure above 60, and his blood pressure remains labile.
- The patient has a Foley catheter in place for urinary retention, and a nasogastric tube is also present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of left-sided effusion, bilateral atelectasis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. The patient is already receiving vancomycin and zosyn for this.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and"

   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head

   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. He was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation. 

The patient has undergone an Arctic sun cooling protocol due to diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT scan. His current condition includes ineffective coping, hypotension (not shock), hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage (anoxic encephalopathy, hypoxic ischemic), and ventricular fibrillation (VF).

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, Troponin-T, TCO2, Glucose, and other labs including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Lactic Acid, Albumin, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4.

The patient's assessment and plan include ineffective coping, hypotension (not shock), hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage (anoxic encephalopathy, hypoxic ischemic), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include further deterioration of brain function leading to irreversible brain damage, worsening of hypoxemia and subsequent respiratory failure, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential infections due to prolonged use"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU after experiencing a PEA (pulsus paradoxus and electrical alternans) arrest and resuscitation. He is currently intubated and unresponsive to any stimulus, with fixed and dilated pupils bilaterally. The patient has undergone Arctic sun cooling protocol for diffuse anoxic brain injury and has been rewarmed. He is now DNR/DNI, with the family meeting with neurology today to discuss possible terminal extubation.

1. Hypoxia: The patient's most likely etiology of PEA arrest was hypoxia, possibly due to an aspiration event given the left lower lobe opacity and air bronchograms on chest X-ray. There is also a consideration of pulmonary embolus, but no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA. The patient's PaO2 is improving with FiO2 of 60, but further monitoring and weaning of FiO2 as tolerated are recommended.

2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has evidence of global anoxic injury likely due to prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration. The head CT on admission showed diffuse cerebral edema, and the physical exam lacks brainstem reflexes. The 48-hour EEG showed flat lines as per neurology. The prognosis is poor, with low likelihood"

   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family meeting with neuro this AM regarding possible
   terminal extubation
   -off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry

   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE

   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now rewarmed
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 48 hour EEG (showing flat line as per neuro)

   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward

   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. He was admitted to the CCU following a prolonged cardiac arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT scan.

The patient's condition is summarized as follows:
- Ineffective coping: The patient is intubated and unresponsive to any stimulus.
- Hypotension (not shock): The patient has labile blood pressure fluctuations.
- Hypoxemia: The patient has significant AA gradient but PaO2 improving with FiO2 of 60.
- Impaired skin integrity: The patient has cool extremities and palpable distal pulses.
- Anoxic brain damage (anoxic encephalopathy, hypoxic ischemic): The patient has a flat EEG and worsening cerebral edema on CT head.
- Ventricular fibrillation (VF): The patient experienced VF during resuscitation but is currently on amiodarone gtt.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Pneumonia vs. pneumonitis: The patient has a left lower lobe opacity and air bronchograms on CXR, indicating possible aspiration event. He is being started on vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): PE is a consideration, but no evidence of right"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of Parkinsonism and autonomic instability who was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration. He has undergone Arctic sun cooling protocol, re-warmed, and is off sedation with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no spontaneous breathing. The patient's condition is described as ineffective coping, hypotension, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage, and ventricular fibrillation (VF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Death: The patient's flat lining EEG, lack of brainstem reflexes, and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan indicate a high likelihood of brain death.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of a new left-sided infiltrate suggests a possible aspiration event leading to pneumonia.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion may have caused lactic acidosis, which is now trending down.
4. Anoxic Brain Injury: The global anoxic injury seen on the head CT scan likely occurred during the prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
5. Hypotension/Autonomic Instability: The patient has a history of labile blood pressure and severe orthostasis. Anoxic injury may be contributing to labile blood pressure.
6. Urinary Retention: The chronic indwelling Foley catheter"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism and autonomic instability. He was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient underwent Arctic sun cooling protocol and is now re-warmed. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT scan showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem reflexes).

The patient's condition is summarized as ineffective coping, hypotension (not shock), hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage (anoxic encephalopathy, hypoxic ischemic), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventricular fibrillation (VF): The patient has a history of VF, which is a life-threatening heart rhythm that can lead to cardiac arrest.

2. Anoxic brain damage: The patient's brain has been deprived of oxygen for an extended period, resulting in anoxic brain injury. This condition has a poor prognosis and may lead to permanent neurological damage or brain death.

3. Pneumonia or pneumonitis: The patient has a left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, indicating a possible aspiration event. This increases the risk of developing pneumonia or pneumonitis.

4. Pulmonary embolism: Although no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CT angi"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 y/o male with parkinsonism,
   autonomic instability, who was admitted to CCU following PEA arrest,
   likely secondary to aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed
   and off sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral
   edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
   spontaneous breathing.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE

   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis but will
   d/c as we are moving to CMO
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read

   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now re-warmed, with unchanged exam
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism and autonomic instability. He was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient underwent Arctic sun cooling protocol and is now re-warmed. He has anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis, as indicated by flat EEG and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan. The patient does not have brainstem reflexes and is unresponsive to any stimulus. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The family is waiting for other members before making a final decision regarding CMO/terminal extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Death: The patient has anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis, flat EEG, and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan. This suggests the possibility of brain death.
2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of labile blood pressure and severe orthostasis. He is currently on dopamine to maintain MAP >60.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's most likely etiology of PEA arrest was hypoxia, possibly due to an aspiration event. He has an AA gradient but PaO2 is improving with FiO2 of 60.
4. Pneumonia vs. Pneumonitis: The patient has a left lower lobe opacity and air bronchograms on CXR, suggesting a possible pneumonia or pneumonitis.
5. Pulmonary Embolus: Although less likely"

   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head

   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test

   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of Parkinsonism and autonomic instability, who was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has undergone the Arctic sun cooling protocol, rewarming, and is now off sedation. He has anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis, as evidenced by a flat EEG and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan. The patient lacks brainstem reflexes and has no spontaneous breathing. 

The patient's family is waiting for other members before making a final decision regarding CMO or terminal extubation. The patient's medical history includes parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He has been on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline, as well as salt tabs. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, ranging from the 80's-90's systolic to the 160's in the evening. Anoxic injury is likely contributing to labile BP.

The patient has been treated for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis with vancomycin and zosyn, but these medications will be discontinued as we are moving to comfort measures only (CMO). The patient's lactic acidosis is likely due to the prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion, but is now trending down. His transaminitis is likely due to ischemic insult and is also trending downward.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 y/o male with parkinsonism,
   autonomic instability, who was admitted to CCU following PEA arrest,
   likely secondary to aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed
   and off sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral
   edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
   spontaneous breathing.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.

   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now re-warmed, with unchanged exam
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 72 hour EEG completed (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal

   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of Parkinsonism and autonomic instability who was admitted to the CCU following a PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient underwent an Arctic sun cooling protocol and is now re-warmed. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's neurological condition is critical, with a flatlining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no spontaneous breathing. A CT scan showed worsening cerebral edema. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with no evidence of acute ischemia on EKG or wall motion abnormality on echo.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with hypoxemia and a significant AA gradient. There is an opacity in the left lower lobe of the lungs, suggesting possible aspiration pneumonia. Pulmonary embolism is another consideration, but there is no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.

The patient has lactic acidosis, likely due to the prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion. Transaminitis is also present, likely due to an ischemic insult. The patient's blood pressure is labile, with a history of severe orthostasis and chronic use of midodrine. He is currently on dopamine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

The patient has urinary retention, possibly due to a chronic indwelling Foley catheter. His electrolyte levels are"

   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output
