","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after undergoing a polypectomy following a screening colonoscopy. He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the emergency department. In the ICU, he experienced transient hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient is currently preparing for a colonoscopy this afternoon and has a history of hematochezia. He also had a syncopal episode while on the commode, accompanied by tachycardia and nausea. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/90 to 104/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, discomfort, and nausea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Post-polypectomy bleed: The patient's presentation of GIB following a polypectomy raises suspicion for a post-polypectomy bleed. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and coagulation parameters is essential to guide further management.
2. Massive transfusion: Due to the patient's active bleeding, there is a risk of massive transfusion, which can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presents with hematochezia, which is blood in the stool, one day after undergoing a polypectomy during a routine colonoscopy. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the emergency department and is currently being prepared for a colonoscopy this afternoon. The patient experienced a transient hypotensive episode in the emergency department that responded to intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient also had a syncopal episode in the morning, which was likely a vagal response due to the preparation for the colonoscopy and use of the commode, but considering the patient's history of diabetes and hypertension, further evaluation is needed.

Potential medical complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient's primary concern is the suspected post-polypectomy bleed, which is causing the hematochezia.
2. Hypotension - The patient had a transient hypotensive episode in the emergency department, indicating a potential risk of low blood pressure.
3. Tachycardia - The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be a compensatory response to the bleeding and hypotension.
4. Fluid imbalance - The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, including IVF and blood transfusions, which may lead to fluid overload.
5. Infection - The patient is at risk of developing infections due"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male who presented with BRBPR (bloody rectal bleeding with a positive guaiac test) following a cecal polypectomy one day prior. The patient underwent an emergency GI scope, which revealed active arterial bleeding at the polypectomy site. Three hemoclips were placed, and the patient received 3 units of blood and 1 liter of saline. The patient's HCT (hematocrit) dropped from 29 to 24 between 9 AM and noon. Subsequently, the patient was given 2 additional units of RBC (red blood cells).

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/73 to 80/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 7,210 mL of fluids since admission, including 5,710 mL of IV fluids and 1,500 mL of blood products. The patient has had a urine output of 950 mL, with a baseline of 400 mL. The patient has also had 125 mL of NG (nasogastric) drainage and 1,900 mL of stool output.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who presented with BRBPR (blood rationing by packing red blood cells) after undergoing a polypectomy one day ago. The patient had active arterial bleeding at the cecal polypectomy site, for which three hemoclips were placed. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped from 29% to 24% since 9 am, and he received 3 units of blood and 1 liter of saline. His current HCT is 30, with a minimum of 27 recorded at 6 pm, and 25 at 5 am. The patient is asymptomatic with stable vital signs, but has not had any bowel movements since the cscope. Negative cardiac enzymes were noted twice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient initially presented with BRBPR and had active arterial bleeding at the cecal polypectomy site. Although the bleeding seems to have been controlled with the placement of hemoclips, there is still a risk of further bleeding or re-bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, ranging from 80/32 mmHg to 128/73 mmHg. This could indicate hypotension and may require further investigation and management.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, and the current value is 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) one day after undergoing a polypectomy following a screening colonoscopy. The patient required emergent colonoscopy, during which active bleeding was identified at the polypectomy site, and clips were placed. The patient received three units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday and is currently stable with no further bleeding. The patient has a background of hypertension, diabetes, and has not reported any known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and he is hemodynamically stable. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent GIB. The patient's physical examination reveals pale conjunctivae, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds with scant crackles at the bases, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and oriented to three. Laboratory results show a decreased hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, increased leukocyte count of 141 K/uL, normal blood glucose level of 127 mg/dL, normal creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and normal potassium levels. The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with values ranging from 189 to 141 K/uL. Imaging and microbiology data are un"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after undergoing a polypectomy following a screening colonoscopy. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday and an additional 2 units this morning due to a declining hematocrit level. He is currently hemodynamically stable with stable vital signs and no further bleeding.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent episode of GIB. His past medical history, social history, and family history remain unchanged except for the noted events above and below.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His eyes and conjunctiva are pale, indicating possible anemia. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds with no murmurs. His extremities are warm and well-perfused. His abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender bowel sounds. Neurologically, he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to three aspects. 

Laboratory results show a slightly low white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, slightly elevated platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are below the detection limit, indicating no cardiac injury. Imaging and microbiology data are unremarkable.

The patient has been diagnosed with post-polypectomy lower gastrointestinal bleed,"
