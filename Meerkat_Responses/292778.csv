","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of seizure-like activity. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is experiencing symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens and seizures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 122/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and moves all four extremities. Physical examination reveals a small abrasion on the left forehead, mild erythema of the conjunctiva, tachycardia, and clear lungs. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving propofol and lorazepam infusions, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's fluid balance is positive at 1,680 mL, and urine output is 320 mL. The patient is expected to remain in the ICU for further monitoring and management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Potential complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and previous treatment for seizures. He presented to the emergency department after being found slumped over in his wheelchair, drunk and drenched in urine. The patient had a seizure in the ED and was admitted for ethanol withdrawal seizure. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

The patient's recent events include being weaned off Ativan, loaded with dilantin, and having a dilantin level of 14. The neurologist decided to overlap Keppra with dilantin due to the risk of cerebellar atrophy with chronic dilantin and alcohol use. The patient's fever spiked to 101 degrees at 0400, and blood and urine cultures were ordered. The patient has a history of chronic EtOH abuse and is currently receiving banana bag daily, NPO/IVF, and scheduled for a complete blood count when he wakes up.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3Â°C (101Â°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 114/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of +3,296 mL in and -1,610 mL out over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.1 K/uL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He was brought to the emergency department after being found slumped over in his wheelchair, intoxicated and drenched in urine. The patient had a seizure in the ED and was admitted for ethanol withdrawal seizure. On admission, he had a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit and was started on IV Ativan for alcohol withdrawal. Blood cultures were obtained, and he was given a loading dose of dilantin due to a suspected seizure disorder. However, his dilantin level was found to be 14, which is higher than expected. Keppra was overlapped with dilantin and eventually discontinued. The patient's vital signs have been fluctuating, with a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius and a heart rate of 81 beats per minute. He is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%. His blood pressure is within normal range at 114/73 mmHg. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, along with low hemoglobin levels. His creatinine and potassium levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate possible liver dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and seizure disorder. He presented with a seizure in the setting of a high ethanol level and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has been treated for suspected alcohol withdrawal, but further evaluation is needed to determine if there is an underlying seizure disorder. The patient's fever has been addressed, and cultures have been ordered. He has a history of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, which may be related to chronic alcohol abuse. Other medical issues include abnormal liver function tests, likely due to alcohol and Hepatitis C, and malnutrition. The plan is to wean sedation and aim for extubation, while closely monitoring the patient's condition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Seizure recurrence due to underlying seizure disorder or alcohol withdrawal.
2. Infection due to intubation and compromised immune system.
3. Pneumonia from aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobility.
5. Continued liver damage and complications from chronic alcohol abuse and Hepatitis C.
6. Malnutrition and refeeding syndrome when introducing nutrition.
7. Bone marrow suppression leading to further pancytopenia.
8. Complications related to weaning off mechanical ventilation and extubation."

   transitioned to Kepra but felt to be noncompliant. Found slumped over,
   alcohol level in 568, started CIWA scale, IV fluids, then seized in ED.
   Transferred to MICU where he seized again with pink, mucus phlegm
   emanating from mouth, unresponsive, intubated for airway protection.
   Overnight, Tm 101, off propofol this AM, started Keppra.
   Put on PSV 5/5 this AM, tolerating well, somnolent but easily
   arousable. Vitals stable, BP 120/80, HR 93, ecchymosis over left eye,
   lungs CTA, HS reg, no stigmata of cirrhosis, moving 4 extremities.
   Labs sifgnificant for wbc 2.8, plt 64, hct 31.2.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse and previous seizures. He presented with a seizure in the setting of an alcohol level of 100 and is suspected to have an underlying seizure disorder. The patient was found slumped over, with an alcohol level of 568, and started on CIWA scale, IV fluids, and then seized again in the emergency department. He was transferred to the MICU where he continued to seize with pink, mucus phlegm emanating from his mouth, and was intubated for airway protection. Overnight, his temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and he was taken off propofol this morning. He was started on Keppra and put on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 5 cmH2O, which he tolerated well. His vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 120/80, heart rate of 93, and ecchymosis over his left eye. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. He moved all four extremities. His lab results showed a white blood cell count of 2.8, platelet count of 64, and hematocrit of 31.2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently suspected to be experiencing alcohol withdrawal seizures. He will need to be monitored closely for signs of withdrawal and put back on the CIWA"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and previous treatment for seizure disorder. He was admitted for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal seizure and experienced a seizure in the emergency department. The patient was loaded on Dilantin but will be transitioning to Keppra due to the risk of cerebellar atrophy with chronic Dilantin and alcohol use. 

The patient was successfully extubated yesterday with minimal symptoms of withdrawal. He is currently receiving lorazepam for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. 

The patient has been diagnosed with fever, seizure, and alcohol withdrawal. His blood work shows pancytopenia, which is likely due to bone marrow suppression caused by chronic EtOH abuse. The patient's platelet count is still trending down, and he is at risk for bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, and his respiratory support has been discontinued. He is on minimal IV fluids and receiving nutrition through ADAT. His blood sugar levels are well controlled, and he is being monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers. 

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be improving, but he requires continued close monitoring and management of his withdrawal symptoms, fever, and pancytopenia."

   41-yo man w/ EtOH abuse and h/o withdrawal seizures, as well as ?
   underlying seizure d/o, who was brought in to the ED when he was found
   slumped over in his wheelchair, drunk and drenched in urine. He
   proceeded to have a seizure in the ED, and is admitted for EtOH
   withdrawal seizure.
   #. Seizure - Likely [**2-22**] EtOH withdrawal given story and presentation,
   but the pt does have a ? underlying seizure d/o and previously treated
   w/ Dilantin, so this may not simply be just an EtOH withdrawal seizure.
   NCHCT is reassuring. Was loaded on Dilantin. Will need to transition to
   Keppra given risk of cerebellar atrophy with chronic dilantin and
   alcohol. Extubated successfully yesterday, minimal si/sx of withdrawal.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and previous withdrawal seizures. He was admitted to the ICU for ethanol withdrawal seizure. The patient had a successful extubation yesterday and is currently on lorazepam for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He is also being treated with dilantin for seizure control, but there is a plan to transition to keppra due to the risk of cerebellar atrophy with chronic dilantin and alcohol use.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 148/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. His general appearance is described as disheveled, and he appears to be in no acute distress. Physical examination findings include mild bruising on the forehead, supple neck, clear lung sounds bilaterally, regular heart rhythm, soft abdomen, and weak extremities with 2+ pedal pulses.

Laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, suggesting pancytopenia. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for hyponatremia. Other lab values are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal.

The assessment and plan include fever, seizure, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient is being monitored for potential complications such as bone marrow"

He presents with a seizure in the setting of an EtOH level of 100. The patient has underlying seizure disorder and was previously treated with Dilantin, transitioning to keppra. 

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Seizure: The patient likely has an EtOH withdrawal seizure, but he also has an underlying seizure disorder. He will continue with the transition of Dilantin to keppra, continue seizure precautions, and have a head CT that is negative.

2. EtOH abuse - chronic: The patient requires daily banana bag treatment, including thiamine 100mg IV x 3 days, MVI, folate, and will undergo screening for alcohol use. He is currently unable to discuss his drinking. He will receive PRN Ativan for CIWA scale, with the last dose at 8:30 AM.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of leukopenic, thrombocytopenic, and anemic findings on repeat bloodwork. Given that all cell lines are down, it is likely bone marrow suppression due to chronic EtOH abuse. HIT and other medication effects (such as Dilantin vs keppra) should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He presents with a seizure in the setting of an ethanol level of 100 mg/dL. The patient has an underlying seizure disorder and has been previously treated with Dilantin, transitioning to Keppra. He is currently delirious and experiencing hallucinations/delusions. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Seizure - The patient has a history of withdrawal seizures and an underlying seizure disorder. He is currently on Dilantin and transitioning to Keppra for seizure management.
2. EtOH abuse - The patient has a chronic history of ethanol abuse, which may contribute to his current condition and increase the risk of further complications.
3. Pancytopenia - The patient has leukopenic, thrombocytopenic, and anemic findings on repeat bloodwork, suggesting possible bone marrow suppression, which could be related to chronic ethanol abuse. The cause of pancytopenia needs further evaluation, including checking for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and other potential medication effects.
4. Abnormal LFTs - The patient has a history of hepatitis C, and his liver function tests are abnormal, likely due to a combination of ethanol abuse and hepatitis C infection.
5. Mild hyponatremia - The patient has mild hyponatremia, which needs further evaluation and management.

Overall, the patient requires close"
