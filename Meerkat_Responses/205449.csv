","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) and is now experiencing complications from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient has been intubated due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 93/65 mmHg to 82/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse transmitted upper airway sounds bilaterally, no appreciable wheezes or rales, and soft abdomen with no tenderness or distention.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 218 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, glucose level of 79 mg/dL, and sodium/potassium levels within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient has been intubated due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure and is now on mechanical ventilation. The patient presents with fever and hypoxia, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest a diagnosis of VAP. Treatment for VAP includes broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC), such as vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Sputum culture and sensitivity testing should be monitored to guide further antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains dependent on mechanical ventilation due to bronchiolitis obliterans. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and the patient may require long-term tracheostomy support.
3. Hypotension: The patient has low-normal blood pressure, which could be attributed to his previous medical history. Holding aldactone and beta-blockers may be considered to manage blood pressure.
4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR of 1.4, likely due to malnutrition and malabsorption. Vitamin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) and is now experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient presented with fever and hypoxia, which are likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The chest CT showed improvement of left basilar consolidation but worsening of right basilar consolidation. The sputum culture grew Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and the blood culture was positive for GNRs as well. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin, and there is a consideration for double coverage of Pseudomonas with ciprofloxacin. 

The patient also has hypotension, likely due to low blood pressure seen during prior admissions. The blood pressure is being monitored along with urine output (UOP). 

The patient's elevated INR is likely due to malnutrition and malabsorption. Vitamin K is being administered, and the INR will be continued to be trended. 

Acute renal failure (ARF) is present with an increase in creatinine from 0.2 to 0.4. This improvement is seen with IV fluids. The patient's urine output ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently in the ICU due to multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received IVIG due to low IgG levels and a nutrition consult for elemental tube feeds, as the patient may have impaired absorption. The patient also received a unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and was found to have positive blood cultures and sputum cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNRs).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/65 mmHg to 82/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and received vancomycin and meropenem for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 23.5%, platelet count (Plt) at 218 K/uL,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient presents with fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The chest CT shows improvement of left basilar consolidation but worsening of right basilar consolidation. Cultures are positive for gram-negative rods (GNRs), both in blood cultures and sputum cultures. The patient has received IVIG for low IgG levels and is being treated with meropenem and voriconazole.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/72 mmHg to 80/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood work reveals anemia with a hematocrit drop from 28.4% to 23.5%, likely due to dilutional component from intravenous fluids. The patient has also received one unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for VAP, continued ventilatory support"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently in the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans, and is dependent on the ventilator due to profound muscle weakness. He has low IgG levels and has been given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patient also has anemia, elevated INR, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypothyroidism. He is being treated with various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and immunosuppressants. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,124 mL and output of 1,330 mL, with a positive balance of 1,794 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient's condition remains stable on the ventilator, and further monitoring and treatment are needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently being treated for VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is now intubated and on mechanical ventilation for repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. VAP: The patient's chest CT showed improvement of left basilar consolidation but worsening of right basilar consolidation. His respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator. Positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods (GNRs) and positive sputum culture for GNRs/GPCs indicate an infection. The patient is currently on meropenem 500 mg IV every 6 hours and voriconazole 200 mg PO twice daily. Further follow-up cultures and sensitivity testing are needed.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has bronchiolitis obliterans, profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure, and tracheostomy. He is still ventilator-dependent and likely has VAP. Treatment for VAP includes the current antibiotics, and he will continue to receive ventilator support as needed, with the ultimate plan to wean to a tracheostomy collar as tolerated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's medical history includes a previous episode of pneumonia caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella, which is a significant concern in this case. The patient's current treatment includes antibiotics, specifically tobra (IV or nebulized), Bactrim, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a temperature of 101.4°F (Tmax), heart rate within normal limits, slightly low blood pressure, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 99% on ventilator support.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and band count, low hemoglobin (Hct) levels, decreased platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), low glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). Other lab values such as sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. He presented with fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has several medical complications, including anemia, elevated INR, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has signs of VAP, which is a type of lung infection that can occur in patients on mechanical ventilation. This infection is characterized by fever, hypoxia, and consolidation on chest imaging. Treatment involves appropriate antibiotics, source control measures, and supportive care.

2. Bronchiolitis Obliterans: This is a chronic lung condition that can occur after lung injury or infection, such as GVHD. It leads to progressive airflow obstruction and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator, but he still requires chronic respiratory support.

3. GVHD: The patient has a history of multi-organ GVHD, which can affect various organs including the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. GVHD is an immune response where donor immune cells attack the recipient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications. The current admission is for fever and hypoxia, which are likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans, for which he requires ventilatory support. 

The patient's recent blood cultures grew out Klebsiella, and he has been started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Tobramycin. The plan is to continue treatment for VAP as above and consider weaning from the ventilator if tolerated. 

The patient's other medical issues include anemia, elevated INR, acute kidney injury (AKI), history of NHL s/p allo BMT with GVHD, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and feeding intolerance. 

The patient is currently on various prophylactic medications including DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and VAP prophylaxis with mouth care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms of fever and hypoxia suggest a possible infection related"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is now intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has signs and symptoms consistent with VAP, including fever, hypoxia, and worsening right basilar consolidation seen on chest CT. Positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture for Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and sputum culture for GNRs/Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) further support this diagnosis. Treatment for VAP includes appropriate antibiotics, and the patient's tobramycin level will be monitored. Additionally, the patient's glucan and galactomannan levels are negative.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bronchiolitis obliterans, a condition causing profound muscle weakness and chronic respiratory failure. He is still dependent on mechanical ventilation and may require long-term tracheostomy support.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of low-normal blood pressure during this admission, which is consistent with his blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently in the ICU due to complications from GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to repeated episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient presented with fever and hypoxia, which were likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A chest CT scan showed improvement in left basilar consolidation but worsening of right basilar consolidation. The sputum culture was positive for Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and bronchoscopy culture confirmed the presence of GNRs.

The patient received one day of Bactrim for possible non-fermenter bacterium infection. Tobramycin therapy was initiated, and a trough level will be monitored tomorrow morning. The patient also received IVIG due to low IgG levels.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/65 mmHg to 81/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38.3°C.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 275 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose level of 79 mg/dL. Other labs, including PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and albumin, are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has signs of infection and positive cultures for GNRs, indicating a possible VAP. Appropriate antibiotics have been initiated, but close monitoring and further treatment may be necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced low-normal blood pressure during this admission, which could be related to his underlying condition or medication effects. Monitoring and adjusting medications may be needed to maintain stable blood pressure.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 28.4 to 23.5, possibly due to dilutional effects from IV fluids. Blood transfusion has been given, and further monitoring of hemoglobin levels is required.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR was elevated at 1.5 on admission but has improved to 1.0 after receiving vitamin K. Continued monitoring of INR levels is necessary.
5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level increased from 0.2 to 0."

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old individual with a history of NHL (Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma) post stem cell transplant, experiencing complications such as GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease) with BO (Bronchiolitis Obliterate), ventilator dependence, and ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia from a pulmonary source. The patient has been admitted for persistent fevers and persistent ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is ventilator-dependent, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of mechanical ventilation.
2. Nosocomial Infections: Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is an increased risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and catheter-related infections.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's use of immunosuppressive medications and prolonged ICU stay may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as Clostridium difficile infection.
4. Line-related Infections: The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, which increases the risk of line-related infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections.
5. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's underlying condition and complications may lead to organ dysfunction, such as renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, or cardiac dysfunction.
6. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with hepar"

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].
    - [**Last Name (un) 430**]/vori D7, Tobra D3 (Klebsiella PNA, sputum and BCx speciation
   and sensitivities confirmed); same bacteria at [**Hospital1 **] OSH
   - f/u repeat glucan
   - f/u ID recs
   - placement of picc line after becoming afebrile for > 24hrs
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - tolerating PSV well, plan to lower to [**7-29**] today
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated
   .
   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.
   - holding aldactone, BB
   - monitor BP, UOP
   .
   # anemia
 Patient with Hct drop 28.4 to 23.5, Could have dilutional
   component as patient was given IVF upon admission because of fever,
   bandemia, hypotension. Given one unit and now at 32.7.
   - continue to trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # elevated INR
 1.5 on admission.  Likely [**1-26**] malnutrition +/-
   malabsorption. Now 1.0-1.1 after vitamin K
   - continue to trend INR
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft versus host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient presented with fever and hypoxia, which are likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed improvement of left basilar consolidation but worsening of right basilar consolidation. The sputum culture confirmed the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the antibiogram indicates that this is not an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producer. The patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotics for the VAP.

The patient has a history of NHL and is in remission. GVHD is the underlying cause of the patient's liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient also has low immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and has been receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, anemia, elevated international normalized ratio (INR), acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypothyroidism. The anemia may have a dilutional component due to intravenous fluid administration"

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx for
   GNRs, positive sputum cx for GNR/GPCs.  Respiratory status remains
   stable on ventilator. Low IgG, given IVIG on [**3-23**]. Received one day of
   bactrim for possible non-fermenterbactrim D1= [**3-24**]
   - [**Last Name (un) 430**]/vori D6, Tobra D2 (ESBL Klebsiella PNA, sputum and BCx
   speciation and sensitivities confirmed); same bacteria at [**Hospital1 **] OSH
   - F/u Tobra level
   - f/u  glucan, galactomannan (negative)
   - placement of picc line after becoming afebrile for > 24hrs
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events? Repositioned
   Nasointestinal tube
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated
   .
   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.
   - holding aldactone, BB
   - monitor BP, UOP
   .
   # anemia
 Patient with Hct drop 28.4 to 23.5, Could have dilutional
   component as patient was given IVF upon admission because of fever,
   bandemia, hypotension. Given one unit and now at 30.5 -> 28 --> 27.6
   - continue to trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # elevated INR
 1.5 on admission.  Likely [**1-26**] malnutrition +/-
   malabsorption. Now 1.0 after vitamin K
   - continue to trend INR
   .
   # ARF
 Cr 0.5 on admission, up from baseline of 0.2.  Improved to 0.3
   (BUN dropped from 12
 9) with IV fluids as of [**3-26**].
   - continue to monitor UOP

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and subsequent allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently in the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a tracheostomy in place. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated respiratory rate. He has a positive blood culture for Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and a positive sputum culture for GNRs and Gram-positive cocci (GPCs). Laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient has received various antibiotics, including meropenem, which is sensitive against the identified bacteria. He has also received IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and is being monitored for potential complications such as anemia, elevated INR, acute renal failure (ARF), and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's current presentation of fever and hypoxia suggests a possible VAP. Appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated based on the sensitivity pattern of the identified bacteria.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute/chronic respiratory failure who is currently ventilator-dependent. They have been diagnosed with possible C. difficile infection and are showing signs of lymphoma. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/50 mmHg to 154/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 49.5 kg, and their height is 67 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,923 mL, including 740 mL via IV fluids, and an output of 2,765 mL. The patient's lab results indicate a WBC count of 7.1, Hct level of 23.5, and platelet count of 45,000/mm³. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's ventilator dependency, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection that can occur in people who are on mechanical ventilation.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient's symptoms of liquid stool and the possibility of C. diff infection indicate that there is a risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis ("

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old individual with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who underwent a Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and is currently experiencing complications. The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to persistent fevers and klebsiella bacteremia, which is an infection caused by the klebsiella bacteria.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/74 to 82/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and other ICU medications. They are also receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and insulin for glycemic control.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 45 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and low albumin levels.

The patient's respiratory status is critical as they are still ventilator dependent, but there has been a decrease in the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 10 cmH2O to 5 cmH2O. The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of non-ESBL klebsiella.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). These complications are common in critically ill patients with prolonged ICU stays and multiple comorbidities.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory parameters to promptly identify any signs of deterioration and take appropriate measures to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute/Chronic respiratory failure
 need to wean vent gradually and
   work with Mr [**Known lastname 11922**]. I explained yesterday the need to work on building
   up resp muscle strength. He remains ventilator dependent but decreasing
   PS, now [**9-28**]. Neuromuscular weakness will make weaning slow but
   hopefully will be independent of vent soon.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].
    - [**Last Name (un) 430**] D8, Tobra D4 (Klebsiella PNA, sputum and BCx speciation and
   sensitivities confirmed); same bacteria at [**Hospital1 **] OSH
   - f/u repeat glucan
   - f/u ID recs
   - placement of picc line after becoming afebrile for > 24hrs
   -check tobra level with am labs tomorrow
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - tolerating PSV well
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube,
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated
   .
   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.
   - holding aldactone, BB
   - monitor BP, UOP
   .
   # anemia
 Patient with Hct drop 28.4 to 23.5, Could have dilutional
   component as patient was given IVF upon admission because of fever,
   bandemia, hypotension. Given one unit and now at 32.7.
   - continue to trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # elevated INR
 1.5 on admission.  Likely [**1-26**] malnutrition +/-
   malabsorption. Now 1.0-1.1 after vitamin K
   - continue to trend INR
   .
   # ARF
 Cr 0.5 on admission, up from baseline of 0.2.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor UOP
   - IVF as needed
   .
   # h/o NHL s/p allo BMT c/b GVHD
 Most recent PET scan with no evidence
   of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.   GVHD is underlying
   cause for patient
s liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   IgG levels low during this admission (197).
   - continue prednisone, mycophenolate
   - Bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole ppx
   - IVIG given, trend LFTs
   - f/u BMT recs
   - add Creon for digestion aid
   .
   # HLP
 Continue simvastatin.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
 Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN
 tube feeds (Peptamen 1.5), repeat as needed.  As patient
   Vitamin A was low, patient
s Vitamin K level was likely low (given
   elevated INR on admission),and patient
s Vitamin D level borderline
   insufficient, this may indicate malabsorption.  Discuss with Nutrition
   / BMT whether tube feeds and/or supplements should be adjusted, as well
   as whether restarting Creon or other enzyme supplementation is
   warranted.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans.
- The patient is currently tracheostomized for repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure and is in the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's chest CT shows improvement of left basilar consolidation but worsening of right basilar consolidation. Klebsiella pneumoniae has been identified in the sputum culture, which is not extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing. The patient is being treated with Tobramycin.
- The patient has bronchiolitis obliterans and profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure. He is still vent-dependent and now with likely VAP.
- The patient's blood pressure has been low-normal during this admission and consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission. It is now resolved.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has dropped from 28.4 to 23.5, which could have a dilutional component due to IV fluids given upon admission. The patient has received one unit of blood and the Hct"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and post-allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans.
- The patient is currently tracheostomized for repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure and admitted for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has been treated for VAP with Tobramycin and will continue with the same antibiotic regimen as per the antibiogram results.
- The patient's respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator, and there are plans to wean to a tracheostomy collar as tolerated.
- The patient has low IgG levels and has received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
- The patient has anemia with a recent Hct drop from 28.4 to 23.5, which could be due to dilutional fluid administration. One unit of blood has been given, and the patient's Hct is now at 32.7.
- The patient's elevated INR on admission is likely due to malnutrition and malabsorption, but it has since normalized after vitamin K administration.
- The patient had acute renal"

   39 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].  Had been on IV meropenem for 7 days, then switched
   to CTX.  Tobramycin was initiated and then stopped per ID recs.
   - CTX D8/14

   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - tolerating PSV well; trach collar if pt willing
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube,
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated, attempt today

   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.

   Critical care addendum
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 38M NHL s/p allo BMT c/b multi-organ GVHD,
   severe restrictive lung ds from BO with chronic resp failure/trached
   here with kelbsiella VAP / bacteremia. Temp curve trending down and
   secretions minimal.  Ctx dosing adjusted and tobra dcd.  Had episode of
   hematuria overnight with UA checked.
   PE:

   LABS:  wbc 11.7, ptt 52, cr 0.3, ua >1000 RBCs, 3 wbc,
   A/ P: Though fever curve is decreasing, he continues to have low grade
   fevers.  Also w/ slowly rising leukocytosis.  Concerning, though no
   obvious additional infection yet identified.  Will continue to assess
   and send differential, repeat stool for C diff, fungal markers, send bl
   cx in setting of temp spike. ID inpt appreciated. He is completing
   course (day [**8-7**]) of ctx for kleb pna/bacteremia.  Tobra dcd.  He has
   minimal resp secretions and is tolerating PS.  Will move to TC weans as
   able.
   Would pursue picc line placement given improvement in temp curve.
   PTT has been intermittently elevated, unclear etiology.  His episode of
   hematuria may be from foley trauma in setting of sq heparin, though
   this is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] dc foley if able to use urinal and repeat us.
   Will dw BMT and pharmacy cell cept dosing, will need to adjust TF rate
   to optimize nutrition.  Creon added for digestive aid.
   We continue his immunosuppressive prophylactic regimen. Additional
   input per BMT team.
   ICU prophylaxis with Boots, PPI, bowel regimen.  Full code. Would
   consult PT.
   Remainder as per resident note. Pt and family updated at bedside.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently in the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. VAP: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of VAP caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The treatment plan includes continuing with the current antibiotic therapy, monitoring respiratory status, and considering weaning from the ventilator as tolerated.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to bronchiolitis obliterans and profound muscle weakness. The goal is to continue supportive care, tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) well, and attempt tracheostomy collar placement if the patient is willing.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced low-normal blood pressure during this admission, which is consistent with previous admissions. The plan involves holding aldactone and beta-blockers, monitoring blood pressure and urine output, and adjusting the treatment accordingly.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 28.4 to 23.5, possibly due to dilutional effects from intravenous fluids."

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo BMT). He is currently in the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a complicated medical history, including multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is tracheostomy-dependent due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure.

1. VAP: The patient's respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator, and he has been diagnosed with VAP. Treatment for VAP includes identifying the causative organism, which in this case is Klebsiella pneumoniae, and initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy. Monitoring renal function is important due to the risk of nephrotoxicity from aminoglycoside antibiotics like tobramycin.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and bronchiolitis obliterans, which are contributing factors for his ventilator dependence. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and the use of a tracheostomy collar should be attempted as tolerated.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped from 28.4 to 23.5. This could be due to a dilutional component as the patient received intravenous fluids (IVF) upon admission. One unit of packed red blood cells has already been given, and the trend in hemoglobin levels should be monitored. Guaiac stools should also be checked to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Elevated INR: The patient's initial INR was elevated at 1.5, likely due to malnutrition and malabsorption. Vitamin K supplementation has helped normalize the INR levels. Continued monitoring of the INR is necessary.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.2 to 0.5, indicating ARF. The cause of ARF could be related to dehydration or nephrotoxicity from medications. Continued monitoring of urine output (UOP) and appropriate management of IVF administration is important.

6. GVHD and Bronchiolitis Obliterans: The patient's history of allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans requires ongoing immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone and mycophenolate. Regular follow-up with BMT recommendations is essential.

7. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction is likely due to GVHD. Monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and administering appropriate medications like Creon for digestion aid and Bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole prophylaxis are necessary.

8. Hypothyroidism and Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].
    - CTX D2, Tobra D5 (Klebsiella PNA, sputum and BCx speciation and
   sensitivities confirmed); same bacteria at [**Hospital1 **] OSH
   - per ID, monitor renal function, check audiogram after tobra D7 and
   discontinue if suggestive of ototoxicity
   - f/u repeat glucan
   - f/u ID recs
   - placement of picc line after becoming afebrile for > 24hrs
   -check tobra level with am labs tomorrow
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - tolerating PSV well
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube,
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated
   .
   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.
   - holding aldactone, BB
   - monitor BP, UOP
   .
   # anemia
 Patient with Hct drop 28.4 to 23.5, Could have dilutional
   component as patient was given IVF upon admission because of fever,
   bandemia, hypotension. Given one unit and now at 32.7.
   - continue to trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # elevated INR
 1.5 on admission.  Likely [**1-26**] malnutrition +/-
   malabsorption. Now 1.0-1.1 after vitamin K
   - continue to trend INR
   .
   # ARF
 Cr 0.5 on admission, up from baseline of 0.2.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor UOP
   - IVF as needed
   .
   # h/o NHL s/p allo BMT c/b GVHD
 Most recent PET scan with no evidence
   of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.   GVHD is underlying
   cause for patient
s liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   IgG levels low during this admission (197).
   - continue prednisone, mycophenolate
   - Bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole ppx
   - IVIG given, trend LFTs
   - f/u BMT recs
   - add Creon for digestion aid
   .
   # HLP
 Continue simvastatin.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
 Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN
 tube feeds (Peptamen 1.5), repeat as needed.  As patient
   Vitamin A was low, patient
s Vitamin K level was likely low (given
   elevated INR on admission),and patient
s Vitamin D level borderline
   insufficient, this may indicate malabsorption.  Discuss with Nutrition
   / BMT whether tube feeds and/or supplements should be adjusted, as well
   as whether restarting Creon or other enzyme supplementation is
   warranted.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].  Had been on IV meropenem for 7 days, then switched
   to CTX.  Tobramycin was initiated and then stopped per ID recs.
   - CTX D8/14
   - f/u repeat glucan
   - f/u ID recs
   - placement of picc line today
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - tolerating PSV well; trach collar if pt willing
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube,
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated, attempt today
   .
   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.
   - holding aldactone, BB
   - monitor BP, UOP
   .
   # anemia
 Patient with Hct drop 28.4 to 23.5, Could have dilutional
   component as patient was given IVF upon admission because of fever,
   bandemia, hypotension. Given one unit; Hct now stable.
   - continue to trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # elevated INR
 1.5 on admission.  Likely [**1-26**] malnutrition +/-
   malabsorption. Now 1.0-1.1 after vitamin K
   .
   # ARF
 Cr 0.5 on admission, up from baseline of 0.2.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor UOP
   - IVF as needed
   - repeat U/A
   .
   # h/o NHL s/p allo BMT c/b GVHD
 Most recent PET scan with no evidence
   of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.   GVHD is underlying
   cause for patient
s liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   IgG levels low during this admission (197).
   - continue prednisone, mycophenolate
   - Bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole ppx
   - IVIG given, trend LFTs
   - f/u BMT recs
   - add Creon for digestion aid
   .

 tube feeds (Peptamen 1.5), repeat as needed.  As patient
   Vitamin A was low, patient
s Vitamin K level was likely low (given
   elevated INR on admission),and patient
s Vitamin D level borderline
   insufficient, this may indicate malabsorption.  Creon was started.

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), status post allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently in the ICU for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient has a tracheostomy and is dependent on the ventilator. He is being treated for VAP with appropriate antibiotics. The respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) well and the tracheostomy collar may be placed if the patient is willing. 

The patient's blood pressure is low-normal and has been consistent with previous admissions. This issue has now resolved. 

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 28.4% to 23.5%, which could be due to a dilutional component as the patient received intravenous fluids upon admission. 

The patient's elevated INR on admission is likely due to malnutrition and/or malabsorption, but it has now resolved after vitamin K administration. 

The patient's serum creatinine level was elevated from 0.2 to 0.5 on admission but has now resolved. 

The patient remains in remission with no evidence of recurrent disease on the most recent PET scan. However, GVHD"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].  Had been on IV meropenem for 7 days, then switched
   to CTX.  Tobramycin was initiated and then stopped per ID recs.
   - CTX D9/14
   - B-glucan elevated, but this could be spurious; per ID, recheck in
   approx. 1 wk ([**4-7**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - re-attempt PICC placement today if patient willing
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - tolerating PSV well; trach collar if pt willing
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube,
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated, attempt today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and subsequent allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is currently tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated for repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is admitted with fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Medical Complications:

1. VAP: The patient has worsening right basilar consolidation on chest CT, positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sputum cultures for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The antibiogram indicates that this is not extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella. The patient has been on IV meropenem for 7 days, then switched to ceftriaxone (CTX). Tobramycin was initiated but stopped per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. The patient's respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator.

2. Bronchiolitis Obliterans: The patient has a history of bronchiolitis obliterans and profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and tracheostomy. The patient is still ventilator-dependent and now with likely VAP.

3. Hypotension: The patient had low-normal blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].  Had been on IV meropenem for 7 days, then switched
   to CTX.  Tobramycin was initiated and then stopped per ID recs.  PICC
   was placed.
   - CTX D10/14
   - B-glucan elevated, but this could be spurious; per ID, recheck in
   approx. 1 wk ([**4-7**])
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - tolerating PSV well; trach collar if pt willing
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube,
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated, attempt again today
   .
   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.
   - holding aldactone, BB
   - monitor BP, UOP
   .
   # anemia
 Patient with Hct drop 28.4 to 23.5, Could have dilutional
   component as patient was given IVF upon admission because of fever,
   bandemia, hypotension. Given one unit; Hct now stable.
   - continue to trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # elevated INR
 1.5 on admission.  Likely [**1-26**] malnutrition +/-
   malabsorption. Now 1.0-1.1 after vitamin K
   .
   # ARF
 Cr 0.5 on admission, up from baseline of 0.2.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor UOP
   - IVF as needed
   - repeat U/A
   .
   # h/o NHL s/p allo BMT c/b GVHD
 Most recent PET scan with no evidence
   of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.   GVHD is underlying
   cause for patient
s liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   IgG levels low during this admission (197).
   - continue prednisone, mycophenolate

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient presents with fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The chest CT shows improvement of left basilar consolidation but worsening of right basilar consolidation. The patient has a positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture for Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is not extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing. The patient has been on intravenous meropenem for 7 days and then switched to ceftriaxone. Tobramycin was initiated but stopped per ID recommendations.

The patient's respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator. The patient has low immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on 3/23. The patient's current medications include prednisone, mycophenolate, Bactrim, acyclovir, and voriconazole prophylaxis. The patient's creatinine levels were elevated from 0.2 to 0.5 on"

   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].  Had been on IV meropenem for 7 days, then switched
   to CTX.  Tobramycin was initiated and then stopped per ID recs.  PICC
   was placed.
   - CTX D11/14, touch base with ID regarding any changes to duration of
   antibiotic course
   - B-glucan elevated, but this could be spurious; per ID, recheck in

   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - consider starting azithromycni for bronchiolitis obliterans
   - tolerating PSV well; trach collar if pt willing

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is not extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing. The patient also has bronchiolitis obliterans, anemia, hypotension, elevated INR, acute renal failure (ARF), a history of NHL s/p allo BMT complicated by GVHD, and other medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and familial emphysema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status remains stable on ventilator, but there is a risk of further deterioration due to bronchiolitis obliterans and VAP.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to immunosuppression from GVHD and prolonged intubation.
3. Bleeding: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a risk of bleeding, especially considering the use of anticoagulants for thrombosis proph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to repeated hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was admitted with fever and hypoxia, which are likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been diagnosed with VAP caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and appropriate antibiotics have been initiated.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/83 to 132/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's recent chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed improvement of left basilar consolidation but worsening of right basilar consolidation. 

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 6.5 to 11.7 thousand cells per microliter (K/uL), hemoglobin (Hct) level dropping from 28.4% to 23.5%, and platelet count ranging from 240 to 280 K/uL. Other lab results include elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) at 359 units per liter (U/L), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 228 IU/L, low albumin at 3.2 g/dL, and elevated beta-glucan.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including bronchiolitis obliterans, profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well and may be a candidate for tracheostomy collar if willing. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and there is no evidence of anemia or acute kidney injury (ARF) at present. The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR) has improved after receiving vitamin K supplementation.

The patient's underlying conditions include a history of NHL post-allogeneic BMT with complications of multi-organ GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient remains in remission with no evidence of recurrent disease on most recent PET scan. GVHD is the underlying cause of the patient's liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient's immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels are low, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been administered. The patient is currently on prednisone, mycophenolate, Bactrim, ac"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**3-23**].  Had been on IV meropenem for 7 days, then switched
   to CTX.  Tobramycin was initiated and then stopped per ID recs.  PICC
   was placed.
   - CTX D11/14, touch base with ID regarding any changes to duration of
   antibiotic course
   - B-glucan elevated, but this could be spurious; per ID, recheck in
   approx. 1 wk ([**4-7**])
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - consider starting azithromycni for bronchiolitis obliterans
   - tolerating PSV well; trach collar if pt willing
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube,
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated, attempt again today
   .
   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.
   - holding aldactone, BB
   - monitor BP, UOP
   .
   # anemia
 Patient with Hct drop 28.4 to 23.5, Could have dilutional
   component as patient was given IVF upon admission because of fever,
   bandemia, hypotension. Given one unit; Hct now stable.
   - continue to trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # elevated INR
 1.5 on admission.  Likely [**1-26**] malnutrition +/-
   malabsorption. Now 1.0-1.1 after vitamin K
   .
   # ARF
 Cr 0.5 on admission, up from baseline of 0.2.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor UOP
   - IVF as needed
   - repeat U/A

   # h/o NHL s/p allo BMT c/b GVHD
 Most recent PET scan with no evidence
   of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.   GVHD is underlying
   cause for patient
s liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans.

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), meropenem, ceftriaxone, and tobramycin. The patient's respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator, and he is being treated for VAP with the mentioned antibiotics.

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has made substantial progress in the ICU and is tolerating tube feeds well. The sputum has diminished, indicating improvement. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but is gradually increasing trache collar trials, suggesting the possibility of weaning off the ventilator soon.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.2 degrees Celsius.

The patient has a history of lymphoma and is currently receiving a 14-day course of antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. The blood glucose levels are within normal range, except for one value which is elevated. The creatinine level is 0.3 mg/dL, indicating some degree of renal impairment.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of edema or cyanosis. The respiratory system examination shows clear breath sounds with scattered crackles, suggesting possible pulmonary involvement.

The patient's neurological examination is normal, with attentive behavior, orientation to time and place, purposeful movements, and normal muscle tone. The patient is able to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.
