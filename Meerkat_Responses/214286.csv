   Developing MOSF
   Main issues include:
   # shock- likely septic with multiple infectious risk including
   Pancytopenia, neutropenia chronic steroids, TPN--?  pna, line infection
   (picc now out) fungal infection, GI source
        Hypovolemia/blood loss also contributing with
   Pancytopenia/thrombocytopenia/anemia, abnl coags ? DIC
   -continue broad antibx coverage cefepime, vanco, flagyl, caspo, ( d/c
   fluconazole)
   - trend lactate, SVO2
   -stress does steroids
   -pressor support, IVF/Colloid for CVP > 10, SVO2 > 70%, correction of
   coagulopathy and for plts >50,
   -check DIC labs
   -TTE
   # Respiratory failure-likely from sepsis and altered ms
   [**Name13 (STitle) 616**] neg for central PE Has increased A-a gradient but with stable
   PIPs/PLT pressures,
   can decrease FIO2 to maintain sats > 90, pao2 > 60
   empiric antbx

   Head CT with diffuse edema and possible watershed infarcts (appears
   most c/w hypoxia/hypotensive picture with ? thrombotic component.
   Neuro consulted.  Loading dilantin, giving mannitol (following osms),
   increasing rate on vent to induce alkalosis, HOB elevated to decrease
   ICP.  EEG ordered.
   Met with patient
s family for 25 minutes after am rounds.  Updated them
   regarding patient
 condition, MOSF.  Family understands that pt is
   critically ill requiring aggressive life support with ventilator,
   pressors for BP support, now in ARF, and with altered MS with ? of
   hypoxic/hypotnesive CNS injury as well as sz activity.  All questions
   were answered.  Will continue to update family of any changes in
   status.  Neuro team consulted and await additional input.  Patient
   remains a full code.
   650pm
   Exam progressively worse over course of day, without corneal reflexes
   and no longer responds to sternal rub.  Had extensive discussion with
   family, GI Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and neurology  DR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 619**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 620**].  Family
   updated and they are aware of poor prognosis.  However, it is still
   unclear  is to the  etiology of CNS findings as pt was not hypotensive
   or hypoxic for prolonged time and initial head CT last night was
   negative for such findings.  Neuro feels that MRI will be helpful in
   further assessing potential reversibility, though prognosis is poor.
   MRI ordered and await EEG results.  Will keep family updated as to any
   change in condition.  Code status readdressed and pt remain full code
   pending further assessment of neuro status with additional studies as
   noted.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, chronic steroid dependence, and recent significant gastrointestinal bleeding treated with methotrexate. She presented with respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status/unresponsiveness. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She required escalating pressor support for hypotension and had seizures. Imaging showed bilateral effusions, rotated position, and scattered nodules in the upper zones bilaterally.

The patient's condition is critical with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) including respiratory failure, hypovolemia/blood loss contributing to shock (likely septic), anemia, pancytopenia/neutropenia, acute kidney injury (anuric), and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's main issues include septic shock, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and multiple organ dysfunction. The main concerns are the potential for further deterioration in vital organ functions, including the central nervous system, kidneys, and coagulation system.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure leading to further hypoxia and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's altered mental status and dilated pupils raise concerns for worsening/acute CNS process, which may indicate a central nervous system infection or embolic event.

The patient's pancytopenia/neutropenia increases the risk of bleeding, particularly with the"

The patient presents to the ICU with hypoxia and hypotension and now has new neurologic changes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 128/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals dilated and fixed pupils, endotracheal and orogastric tubes, normal heart sounds, diminished peripheral pulses, coarse ventilated breath sounds, distended and firm abdomen with bowel sounds, and warm skin. Neurologic examination shows unresponsiveness with no movement or assessed tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia (white blood cell count of 1.4 K/uL), anemia (hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 10), elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, and hyponatremia (sodium of 112 mEq/L).

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 612**] is a 61F with a PMH s/f Crohn's disease on chronic steroids,
   RUE DVT, and pancytopenia secondary to MTX toxicity who presents to the
   ICU septic shock, respiratory failure, and global cortical ischemia
   # Hypotension/Shock: Given neutropenic status, bandemia and RLL
   infiltrate, this is likely septic shock from PNA.  Other possible
   sources are her PICC line and fungemia given her risk factors.  PICC
   ine removed and broadly covered for neutropenic fever/ fungemia.  CTPA
   negative for PE, showing bilateral pulmonary nodules ddx on report
   includes crohn's nodules, septic emboli, and infectious.  Pan cultured,
   results pending.  Currently CVP and MAP are at goal, weaned off
   levophed and neosynephrine.
   -Continue IVF to keep CVP >12, add back pressors for MAP <65
    -follow up micro
   -continue broad abx coverage with vanc/cefepime/caspofungin
   - stress dose steroids
   -Echo when more stable
   # Respiratory distress: CTA negative for PE, likely secondary to PNA.
   7.4/16/121 on 500x20 with PEEP 8 and FIO2 of 40%.  This is at our goal
   of pCO2 for cerebral edema.
   -Broad spectrum abx for HAP in a  neutropenic host, as indicated above
   -Daily CXRs
   -Continue ventilator settings to keep pCO2 <23 in the setting of
   cerebral edema
   # Diffuse cerebral edema:  MRI showing diffuse cortical edema and
   ischemia.  DDX includes anoxic brain injury vs. metabolic insult.
   Patient was hypotensive in the setting of shock, making anoxic brain
   injury highly likely.  Prognosis is grim for a meaningful recover per
   discussion with neurology
   -Neuro consulting
   -hyperventilation with goal pCO2 of 23, and mannitol with goal serum
   osm of >320.  Mannitol currently held for elevated osm
   # Seizure activity: Likely a result of toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   -EEG pending
   # Diffuse pulmonary nodules: DDX includes septic emboli vs. crohn's
   nodules, vs. infection
   -TTE to evaluate for embolic source
   -Continue broad spectrum abx as above
   # Neutropenia: ANC 80, secondary to MTX toxicity
   -Neutropenic precautions
   -Continue broad coverage for PNA
   # Thrombocytopenia: secondary to MTX toxicity, with mucosal bleeding.
   s/p 5 units of platelets with count rising from 10-->50
   -Transfuse platelets for active bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: elevated PT/INR, DIC labs negative.  Likely a result of
   liver injury in the setting of ischemia, s/p 5 units of platelets and 4
   units of FFP
   -Monitor q4H DIC labs
   -Transfuse FFP for active bleeding, cryo for fibrinogen <100

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, chronic steroids use, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pancytopenia secondary to methotrexate (MTX) toxicity. She presents to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and global cortical ischemia.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension/shock, respiratory distress, diffuse cerebral edema, seizure activity, diffuse pulmonary nodules, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, mucositis, Crohn's disease, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to pneumonia (PNA) or possible fungemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover for both bacterial and fungal infections.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to PNA. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential. Adjustments in ventilator settings may be required to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further injury to the brain.

3. Diffuse cerebral edema: The patient has diffuse cortical edema consistent with global ischemia. This could be due to anoxic brain injury or metabolic insult. Hyperventilation with a goal pCO2 of 23 and mannitol therapy are being used to manage cerebral ed"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 612**] is a 61F with a PMH s/f Crohn's disease on chronic steroids,
   RUE DVT, and pancytopenia secondary to MTX toxicity who presents to the
   ICU septic shock, respiratory failure, and global cortical ischemia
   # Hypotension/Shock: Given neutropenic status, bandemia and RLL
   infiltrate, this is likely septic shock from PNA.  Other possible
   sources are her PICC line and fungemia given her risk factors.  PICC
   ine removed and broadly covered for neutropenic fever/ fungemia.  CTPA
   negative for PE, showing bilateral pulmonary nodules ddx on report
   includes crohn's nodules, septic emboli, and infectious.  Pan cultured,
   results pending.  Currently CVP and MAP are at goal, weaned off
   levophed and neosynephrine.
   -Continue IVF to keep CVP >12, add back pressors for MAP <65

   # Respiratory distress: CTA negative for PE, likely secondary to PNA.
   7.4/16/121 on 500x20 with PEEP 8 and FIO2 of 40%.  This is at our goal
   of pCO2 for cerebral edema.
   -Broad spectrum abx for HAP in a  neutropenic host, as indicated above

   # Diffuse cerebral edema:  MRI showing diffuse cortical edema and
   ischemia.  DDX includes anoxic brain injury vs. metabolic insult.
   Patient was hypotensive in the setting of shock, making anoxic brain
   injury highly likely.  Prognosis is grim for a meaningful recover per
   discussion with neurology
   -Neuro consulting
   -hyperventilation with goal pCO2 of 23, and mannitol with goal serum
   osm of >320.  Mannitol currently held for elevated osm

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 612**], a 61-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, chronic steroids use, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pancytopenia secondary to methotrexate (MTX) toxicity, presented to the ICU in septic shock, respiratory failure, and global cortical ischemia. She is unresponsive and has fixed dilated pupils bilaterally, indicating severe brain injury. The patient's condition is extremely grim, and she is unlikely to recover.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock from pneumonia (PNA). Other possible sources include the PICC line and fungemia given her risk factors. Broad coverage for neutropenic fever/fungemia has been initiated, and the PICC line has been removed. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) are at goal, and she has been weaned off vasopressors.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to PNA. A CT angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), showing bilateral pulmonary nodules. Broad spectrum antibiotics have been started for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in a neutropenic host.

3. Diffuse Cerebral Edema: An MRI showed diffuse cortical edema and ischemia"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, chronic steroid dependence, and on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypotension, and unresponsiveness. The patient had a significant gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) treated with methotrexate (MTX) and developed pancytopenia/neutropenia. 

The patient's current condition includes diffuse cerebral edema, new seizure activity, dilated pupils, and altered mental status. She is also experiencing anemia, renal failure (anuric), neutropenia, transaminitis, and suspected hemolysis. 

The main issues identified include septic shock, hypovolemia, pancytopenia/thrombocytopenia, and potential disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient requires continued broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, stress dose steroids, pressor support, and correction of coagulopathy.

Additionally, the patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation for respiratory support due to respiratory failure. Efforts are being made to wean her off the ventilator. The patient's brain death is suspected based on unresponsiveness, seizure activity, and findings on imaging.

Further assessments and plans include monitoring fluid balance, electrolytes, and daily lab results. The patient's family has been informed of her grim prognosis,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, chronic steroid dependence, and currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient was transferred from the floor with altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, and new seizure activity. 

The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, with diffuse cerebral edema observed on brain imaging. There are concerns about potential medical complications including hypoxia, hypotension, septic shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, anemia/pancytopenia, and transaminitis. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/68 to 152/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, deranged coagulation profile, elevated lactate levels, and electrolyte abnormalities. Imaging studies reveal diffuse cerebral edema on MRI, and the patient has bilateral effusions on chest X-ray. 

The patient's family has been informed of the grave prognosis, with impending brain death, and they wish to withdraw ventilatory support in the morning. In the event of"
