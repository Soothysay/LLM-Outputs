","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%), ventricular tachycardia (VT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, and anemia. He presented with weakness and was found to have sepsis, as evidenced by elevated lactate levels, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures growing gram-positive cocci. He is currently receiving vancomycin for suspected left foot ulcerations. The patient also has acute-on-chronic heart failure, hyponatremia, transaminitis, acute renal failure (ARF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB with RVR), ICD firing, and a history of depression and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for sepsis with antibiotics, but close monitoring for signs of deterioration or new infection is necessary.
2. Acute-on-Chronic CHF: The patient's worsening hyponatremia and crackles in the lungs indicate fluid overload. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure and adjusting fluid administration accordingly is essential.
3. Transaminitis: The cause of the elevated liver enzymes is unclear, but it may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in 2144. He also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) after implantable pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, and depression. The patient presented with weakness for 10 days and was found to have sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, indicated by elevated lactate levels, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis. Blood cultures are growing gram-positive cocci, suggesting a bacterial infection. The source of infection is possibly a left foot ulceration.

2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to sepsis and mild shock liver. Hepatology consultation has been sought, and further evaluation of liver function and coagulation parameters is necessary.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential acute renal failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) five times, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) post pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, and presents from home with weakness for 10 days.

The patient was found to have sepsis with a lactate level of 11.9, Afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the 140s, and leukocytosis of 14.3, all consistent with sepsis. Blood cultures are growing out gram-positive cocci in 4/4 bottles. The source of infection is possibly a left foot ulceration, and X-ray showed no signs of osteomyelitis. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and will continue with the same antibiotic. A vascular consult is recommended.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic CHF, as indicated by worsening hyponatremia and crackles in the lungs. Lasix 40mg IV PRN is prescribed to manage fluid overload, and the goal is to achieve a urine output of -1L today. Mid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cardiac artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%), history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), atrial fibrillation (AFib) on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, and previous MRSA pneumonia requiring intubation. He presents with weakness for 10 days and is found to have sepsis. He has a cough over the past week, CXR with possible left lower lobe infiltrate, and elevated lactate of 11.9. Blood cultures and urinalysis are pending. He also has impaired skin integrity, cardiac dysrhythmia, and transaminitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level, leukocytosis, and clinical presentation are consistent with sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and blood cultures are pending.
2. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has a history of VT and AFib. His current rhythm is ventricular paced, and he is not on Coumadin due to elevated INR. Hold amiodarone given hepatitis, consider giving beta-blockers or diltiazem IV PRN if the patient goes into RVR, and hold anticoagulation as IN"

 CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA OTHER
   62 yom with history of CAD s/p CABG x 5 in [**2144**], UGIB, Chronic Systolic
   CHF (EF 20%), hx of VT s/p PPM/ICD in [**2144**], Afib on Coumadin,
   Hyperlipidemia who presents from home with weakness x 10 days found to
   have sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Mr. [**Known lastname 10380**] presents with lactate of 11.9, Afib with RVR to
   140s and leukocytosis of 14.3 all consistent with sepsis.  He is also
   c/o of cough over the past week.  Patient has history of MRSA PNA
   requiring intubation in the past, CXR with ?LLL infiltrate.  will treat
   broadly at this time as there is no clear source.  Urinalysis
   negative.  Blood Cx, Urine Cx drawn and pending.  LFT elevated, U/S
   done in ED shows no cholecystitis or biliary ductal dilatation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   related to sepsis as lactate 11.9.  Other possibility is CHF as patient
   had similar presentation in [**Month (only) 1918**] which resonded to diuresis,
   however, CXR with minimal congestion and HR responded to fluids in the
   ED.
   -- Vanco/Cipro IV for ?PNA/?skin soft tissue infection of left foot
   -- gentle IVF fluid resuscitation given low EF
   -- Place CVL
   -- Intubate if needed if becomes hypoxic
   -- f/u Blood Cx
   -- Podiatry/wound consult, send wound cultures
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Unclear etiology at this time but may be related to
   sepsis and mild shock liver as lactate 11.9.  CT done and shows no
   biliary cause.  Serum tox negative for acetaminohen, patient denies
   EtOH use.  Patient had similar presentation in [**7-/2159**] which was thought
   [**1-1**] shock liver/hypotension.  ?Amiodarone related.  Will cont to
   monitor.  INR also elevated so LFT abnormality could be more chronic
   than acute.
   -- trend LFTs/coags [**Hospital1 **] for now
   -- hold Amiodarone for now
   -- IVF as above
   .
   # ARF:  Likely related to sepsis, BUN/Cr less than 20, so more likely
   related to ATN. will treat with IVF and trend.
   -- [**Hospital1 **] Cr and Lytes today
   -- send Urine Lytes
   -- send Digoxin Level, dose PRN level
   -- IVF as above
   -- hold Lasix, Aldactone
   -- renally dose meds
   -- avoid nephrotoxic medication
   .
   # Afib with RVR: Currently, patient is in Afib with normal rate s/p
   fluids.  Currently not on Coumadin, but INR elevated, likely [**1-1**] liver
   dysfunction.
   - hold amiodarone given hepatitis
   - if patient goes into RVR can give BB or dilt IV PRN
   - hold anticoagulation as INR elevated
   - send digoxin level, dose upon level
   .
   # ICD firing:  per patient, ICD fired x 2.  EP consulted in ED and
   pacer interrogated, no Vtach noted, patient has been in afib with RVR
   over the weekend.
   - f/u EP consult
   - hold amiodarone as above
   .
   # Chronic CHF:  Patient with history of chronic CHF.
   - hold lasix, spironolactone for now given ARF, if patient becomes
   overloaded with fluid resucitation can restart
   - follow UOP
   - cont midodrine
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:  No signs of MI at this time, CK flat and Trop 0.[**4-6**]
   be related to ARF.  Not on BB, ACE-I as outpatient.
   - trend CE
   - not on ASA at home, ruling out for MI but will hold ASA given INR
   elevation
   - hold Statin give elevated LFTs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of weakness. The patient has been receiving IV fluids overnight and has shown improvement in lactate levels, which were initially elevated. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac dysrhythmia. Vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/69 mmHg to 105/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications in the ICU and has allergies to penicillins and amiodarone. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total input of 2,418 mL and output of 725 mL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with low potassium and magnesium levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If left untreated or inadequately managed, sepsis can progress to organ dysfunction and potentially lead to septic shock.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. These can become infected and complicate the patient's overall condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a permanent pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (PPM/ICD), and atrial fibrillation on warfarin. The patient presented with 10 days of weakness and dry cough.

Upon examination, the patient was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive with elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate levels. Blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci (GPC) clusters in all four bottles, indicating bacteremia. The source of bacteremia is suspected to be cellulitis or osteomyelitis in the left foot. The patient appears well but has significant elevation of lactate, raising concerns for a mitochondrial defect or glycogen storage disease that should be evaluated as an outpatient.

The patient has been adequately volume-resuscitated and is now experiencing mild CHF. The plan includes following up with cultures, discontinuing ciprofloxacin, continuing vancomycin for 10 days, and monitoring serial lactate levels. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered.

Other assessments and plans include treating CHF"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation (afib) on coumadin. The patient presented with 10 days of weakness and dry cough. Upon examination, he was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive with elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/tachycardia/elevated lactate: The patient may be experiencing sepsis, although decompensated CHF is also a possibility. Possible sources include viral syndrome or pneumonia given the cough, cellulitis/osteomyelitis of the left foot. The significant elevation of lactate raises concern for a mitochondrial defect that should be evaluated as an outpatient.

2. Transaminitis: The etiology of transaminitis is unclear, but it may be related to sepsis and mild shock liver as lactate is elevated. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) was unremarkable. Serum toxicology was negative for acetaminophen, and the patient denies alcohol use. The patient had a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, atrial fibrillation (Afib) on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, presenting with weakness for 10 days and found to have sepsis. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has several medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, cardiac dysrhythmia, acute on chronic CHF, hyponatremia, transaminitis, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury (ARF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and ICD firing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has an ongoing infection indicated by blood cultures growing gram-positive cocci and signs of sepsis such as leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. This condition needs to be treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a left foot ulceration that may be a source of infection, leading to impaired skin integrity. This requires regular assessment and management to prevent further complications"

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins and amiodarone, as well as hypothyroidism. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent a transesophageal echo (TEE) at 02:00 PM on [**2159-10-23**]. The TEE showed no valvular vegetations, intracardiac or significant transpulmonary shunting. However, it revealed a dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction, a dilated right ventricle with moderate global systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient was started on Lasix yesterday morning due to concern for fluid overload and worsening hyponatremia. However, the patient did not respond well to Lasix 40mg and then 80mg IV x 1, so additional fluid boluses were given at midnight with good response.
- Blood pressures were in the high 80s in the afternoon and trended down to the high 70s overnight. The patient was given two 250cc IVF boluses with good response, resulting in a blood pressure of 102/"

   lactate/hypoglycemia:  Possible source is cellulitis/osteo of L foot.
   Patient quite well appearing given significant elevation of lactate
   raises concern for mitochondrial defect or glycogen storage disease
   that should be evaluated as an outpatient.  Adequately volume
   resuscitated and now in mild CHF.
   - F/U cultures

   - Diuresis
   - q4-6h Na+
   - Free water restrict; change carriers of all meds possible
   - Consider hypertonic saline if continues to fall

   # ARF:  Likely related to sepsis, but BUN/Cr less than 20 also
   indicates possible ATN. Slowly improving.
   - q12 creatinine and lytes
   # LE ulcer:
   - Vascular consult
 may need amputation
   - Abx as above
   # Afib with RVR:  ICD fired 2x over weekend in this setting.
   - Improved rate control with BB and amio

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x5, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) post pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presents with 10 days of weakness and dry cough. He is found to be tachycardic and hypotensive with elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate. The patient is suspected to have bacteremia, likely caused by cellulitis or osteomyelitis in his left foot. He appears well but has significant elevation in lactate levels, raising concerns for a mitochondrial defect or glycogen storage disease that should be evaluated as an outpatient. The patient is adequately volume-resuscitated and now in mild CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient is likely suffering from bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. CHF: The patient's condition has resulted in mild congestive heart failure, possibly due to volume overload.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely related to the volume overload caused by CHF.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) after pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. The patient presents with 10 days of weakness and dry cough, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and lactate levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Bacteremia: Likely caused by cellulitis/osteomyelitis in the left foot. The patient appears well but has elevated lactate levels, which raises concern for mitochondrial defect or glycogen storage disease to be evaluated as an outpatient. The patient is adequately volume-resuscitated and now shows signs of mild CHF.
- Follow-up cultures
- Continue vancomycin for 10 days and discontinue ciprofloxacin
- Monitor serial lactates
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)

2. CHF: Mild pulmonary edema due to volume resuscitation for sepsis.
- Diurese
- Rate control

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery five times in 2144. He also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) for which he received a permanent pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (PPM/ICD) in 2144, atrial fibrillation (Afib) on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, weakness for 10 days, and sepsis.

The patient presented with lactate levels of 11.9, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the 140s, and leukocytosis of 14.3, all consistent with sepsis. Blood cultures showed growth of gram-positive cocci in 4/4 bottles, indicating bacteremia. The source of infection is suspected to be a left foot ulceration. MSSA is also growing.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoglycemia, acute on chronic CHF, acute renal failure (ARF), liver function abnormalities, sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, cardiac dysrhythmia, and depression.

Treatment plans include continuing vancomycin, checking its level, and following up with"

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and amiodarone, and is currently on multiple medications including dopamine, furosemide (Lasix), dextrose, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/72 mmHg to 113/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,557 mL and output of 1,636 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 921 mL. The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate, and liver enzymes, while their white blood cell count is within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating throughout the day. The patient's cardiac rhythm is currently ventricular-paced. The patient's neurological status remains unchanged. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and there is a growing multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus wound"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone five coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries. He presents with weakness and is found to have sepsis. The patient has several medical conditions including chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%), atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are low, indicating hypoglycemia.
2. Acute on chronic heart failure (CHF): The patient's worsening hyponatremia and crackles in the lungs suggest fluid overload, consistent with acute on chronic CHF.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely related to sepsis, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level.
4. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has transaminitis, possibly related to sepsis and mild shock liver.
5. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has sepsis with positive blood cultures growing gram-positive cocci, possibly from a left foot ulceration.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has wound infections with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic systolic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. He presents to the hospital with weakness and is found to have sepsis, bacteremia, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes and is receiving insulin therapy, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure has worsened, leading to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and dehydration.
4. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has transaminitis, possibly due to sepsis, mild shock liver, or medications.
5. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient initially presented with sepsis and bacteremia, which is now being treated with antibiotics.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has wounds that are infected with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction of 20%), history of ventricular tachycardia treated with pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, atrial fibrillation, presenting from home with weakness for 10 days. The patient was found to be hypotensive, tachycardic, with elevated lactate levels, low glucose, and transaminitis. The patient was deemed to be septic with a possibility of congestive heart failure.

24-hour events include the insertion of a multi-lumen central line on 10/24/2159 at 07:02 PM. Allergies include penicillins causing anaphylaxis and amiodarone causing hypothyroidism. The patient received ciprofloxacin and vancomycin on 10/24/2159.

Current vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, current temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 105 bpm (normal range: 70-113 bpm), blood pressure of 108/63 mmHg (with readings ranging from 75/49 mmHg to 113/93 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (normal range: 8-22 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 93%, and heart rhythm of ventricular paced beats.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,557 mL with 210 mL output through the NG tube, 1,636 mL output through IV fluids, 871 mL output through blood products, and 913 mL output through urine. The total output is 1,644 mL with a negative balance of 505 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via none and an oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's ABG results are not available.

Physical examination reveals altered mental status, with the patient stating ""Bismish"" and not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other areas.

Lab results include hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 196 K/uL, glucose level of 20 mg/dL, sodium level of 130 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride level of 98 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.5 mg/dL, and calcium level of 8.5 mg/dL. Other lab values include a white blood cell count ranging from 12.3 to 13.3 K/uL, hematocrit ranging from 31.8% to 32.1%, platelet count of 96 K/uL, creatinine levels ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 mg/dL, troponin-T levels ranging from 0.04 to"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Shock
 likely secondary to resolving sepsis, and CHF (EF 20%, 2+MR,
   4+TR), as below.  Sepsis has generally improved, however primary issues
   seems secondary to pulmp failure.
   2. Sepsis-  [**1-1**] MSSA, high grade bacteremia.  Likely source is from
   foot wound.  Now improved.  Continued on vancomycin.
   3. CHF
 LVEF20%.  Now hemodynamically improved on dopamine.  Sodium
   trending up, lactate trending down.  Will plan to continue dopamine and
   lasix drip to attempt to restore appropriate starling relationsip.
   Will shoot for 1.5L neg o/n (on stable dopamine dose).
   4. Hyponatremia
 cont to f/u sodium closely
   5. Transaminitis
 LFTs stable.  r/o portal vv thrombosis.
   6. Lactate- partially related to production.  ? metabolism
   7. Altered mental status- TSH ok on [**10-22**], likely ICU delirium  and
   resolving hyponatremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia treated with a pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, atrial fibrillation, weakness for 10 days, hypotension, tachycardia, lactate level of 11, and hyperglycemia. The patient presented from home with weakness for 10 days and was found to be hypotensive, tachycardic, with elevated lactate and glucose levels. The patient was initially felt to be septic with possible congestive heart failure (CHF).

24-hour events include the placement of a multi-lumen catheter on October 24th at 7:02 PM. The patient has allergies to penicillins and amiodarone. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ciprofloxacin on October 24th at midnight and vancomycin on October 24th at 8:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving dopamine at a rate of 3.5 mcg/kg/min and furosemide (Lasix) at 5 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include dextrose 50% started on October 25th at 6:00 AM.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing multiple health complications. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient developed respiratory distress and required invasive ventilation. They were intubated last night.
2. The patient has allergies to penicillins and amiodarone, which can cause anaphylaxis.
3. The patient received antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Vancomycin) within the past 24 hours.
4. The patient is receiving various infusions, including Norepinephrine, Fentanyl, and Midazolam.
5. The patient also received Furosemide (Lasix) and Dextrose 50% in the past 24 hours.
6. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted changes.
7. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/76 to 122/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
8. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
9. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.28, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 248, and respiratory rate (RR) of 9.2 L/min.
10. The patient's lab results show low glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high creatinine levels, low bicarbonate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
11. The patient's assessment and plan include hypoglycemia, heart failure, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, sepsis, impaired skin integrity, cardiac dysrhythmia, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and risk factors.
3. Nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or urinary tract infections (UTIs).
4. Further deterioration of renal function.
5. Progression of heart failure.
6. Worsening liver function.
7. Development of new cardiac dysrhythmias.
8. Skin breakdown and pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.

These are potential complications based on the information provided, but further evaluation and monitoring by healthcare professionals are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   62 y/o m with history of CAD s/p CABG x 5 in [**2144**], UGIB, Chronic
   Systolic CHF (EF 20%), hx of VT s/p PPM/ICD in [**2144**], Afib, a/w likely
   septic shock c/b CHF.  Unclear etiology of decompensation last night.
   HR increased in the setting of hypothermia, possibly over the threshold
   for BiV pacing and reduced filling.
   1. Shock
 cannot r/o recrudescent sepsis given that wound has not been
   definitively treated.  CXR also shows inc density and question whether
   there may be LLL consolidation/collapse.  With those caveats, his CHF
   and severe valvular disease are clearly complicating and likely
   represent a primary etiology for shock.
   -d/w cardiology re: placement of PA line vs other therapies.
   -expand empiric antibiotic coverage, aztreonam vs. meropenem
   2. Respiratory failure
 likely [**1-1**] worsening CHF in the setting of
   cardiogenic failure.  Maintained on 50% FiO2, P/F ratio is 248 so no
   indication for low tidal vol vent.
   3. Sepsis-  [**1-1**] MSSA, high grade bacteremia.  Likely source is from

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 10380**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10949**], whose note above
   reflects my input.  Underwent trial of neosynephrine today, without
   good UOP response
 back to dopa.  Multiple discussions with
   cardiology.  Other events and data as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10949**].
   Shock
 likely mixed cardiogenic.  Given CXR, will d/w ID about
   potentially broadening coverage.  Will place arterial line and assess
   pulse contour for possible CO measurement, then consider dobutamine
   trial.  PA line might be reasonable, but likely best placed under
   fluoro and not completely clear that TD or Fick CO would be reliable in
   this patient.  Can also consider increasing PEEP and assessing
   hemodynamic response.
   Respiratory failure
 leave on support during shock state
   MRSA bacteremia
 source is likely foot; continue vanco; ID following.
   Met with patient
s wife, along with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10949**].  She notes that
   although he wanted
extraordinary measures
 that she also feels he is
   getting them presently and wonders how long this can go on.  She is
   also clear that in the event of arrest she would not want him to
   undergo chest compressions, which seems entirely reasonable.
   Therefore, no CPR in the event of pulseless arrest (ICD already in
   place).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent CABG x 5 in 2144. He also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia after pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation in 2144, atrial fibrillation, weakness for 10 days, hypotension, tachycardia, lactate of 11, glucose of 20, and transaminitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

The patient presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels, indicating possible septic shock. The patient's condition deteriorated overnight, with a significant drop in blood pressure and heart rate. The patient was started on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including septic shock likely secondary to a foot wound infection with high-grade bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), acute on chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring multiple interventions such as norepinephrine infusion, dopamine infusion, and intubation. The patient's heart rhythm is irregularly irregular, indicating atrial fibrillation.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), as well as other medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), hyperlipidemia, and depression. 

The patient presented to the hospital with weakness and was found to have sepsis. Blood cultures grew out gram-positive cocci, most likely Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), which is a common cause of skin infections. The source of infection is possibly a left foot ulceration. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute on chronic CHF, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypoglycemia, altered mental status, and cardiac dysrhythmia. These conditions require immediate attention and treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and oxygenation. However, the patient is on multiple pressors (norepinephrine and dopamine) to maintain blood pressure, and intubated for respiratory support. 

Laboratory results show elevated lactate levels indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion, abnormal liver function tests, impaired coagulation profile, and acute kidney injury. 

The patient's current medications include various antibiotics, inotropic agents, diuretics, anticoagulants, and medications for chronic conditions such as CHF and hyperlipidemia."

   CHF (EF 20%), hx of VT s/p PPM/ICD in [**2144**], Afib on Coumadin,
   Hyperlipidemia who presents from home with weakness x 10 days found to
   have sepsis.
   # Acute on Chronic CHF:  Patient with history of chronic CHF, could not
   be easily diuresed yesterday and was on dopamine and lasix gtt but
   could not tolerate.  Then was intubated and placed on second pressor
   (levophed).
   - switch levophed to neo
   - consider swan catheter
   - consider dobutamine
   - stop midodrine
   - d/c metoprolol
   - consult cards with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10946**]
   - EP increased BiV PPM rate to 120 to try and increase CO; VT set at
   146
   - patient has severe heart failure and likely decompenstated from
   worsening R heart failure, possibly in the setting of extra fluids.  Is
   now hemodynamically stable on above pressors, but will try to wean as
   tolerated
   # Sepsis/bacterimia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 10380**] presented with lactate of 11.9, Afib
   with RVR to 140s and leukocytosis of 14.3 all consistent with sepsis.
   Blood cultures now growing out gram + cocci, 4/4 bottles but have since
   cleared.  Will cont with Vanco, source is possibly left foot
   ulcerations.  Xray showed no signs of osteo.  Growing MSSA.
   - cont Vanco, check level; has pcn allergy and would just like to
   continue vanco despite MSSA growing out
   - consider other sources of sepsis as patient was hypothermic when he
   became hypoxic; xray may show retrocardiac opacity vs. collapsed lung;
   could broaden abx to HAP if worsens respiratory status
   -- f/u Podiatry consult
 ABIs pending
   -- f/u Vascular consult
   # Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic. Improving from 122 to 129, stable over
   last day since diuresis has leveled off
   - q6h Na
   - consider tolvaptan
   - renal cosult
   # Transaminitis:  Unclear etiology at this time but may be related to
   sepsis and mild shock liver as lactate 11.9.  CT done and shows no
   biliary cause.   Hepatology consulted, appreciate recs
   -- trend LFTs/coags daily
   -- restart Amiodarone
   -- hold statin for now
   -- plan for liver US tomorrow to rule out portal thrombosis
   - start lactulose
   # Coagluopathy: Likely a consequence of abx, poor po and liver injury;
   was not on anticoagulation at home
   - vit K 3mg
   - probably not hypoxic/hypotensive from clot due to his high INR
   # ARF:  Likely related to sepsis, Cr stable
   -- inoptropes as above; stable despite worsening heart failure
   -- renal c/s
   -- avoid nephrotoxic medication
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology; likely related to metabolic
   encephalopathy, vs. hepatic encephalopathy, vs. poor perfusion, vs.
   hypoglycemia vs. ICU delirium.
   - monitor for focal neurological deficits; none now
   - treat medical problems as above
   - lactulose
   - now sedated and intubated so hard to address
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: likely from poor PO intake and liver failure
   - now OG tube so tube feeds
   # Afib with RVR: Currently, patient is in Afib with normal rate s/p
   fluids.  Currently not on Coumadin, but INR elevated, likely [**1-1**] liver
   dysfunction.
   - resume amiodarone
   - hold anticoagulation as INR elevated
   # ICD firing:  per patient, ICD fired x 2.  EP consulted in ED and
   pacer interrogated, no Vtach noted, patient has been in afib with RVR
   over the weekend.
   - f/u EP consult; will talk with EP about if pacer is catching HRs
   above 100; looks like they are
   - amiodarone as above
   # CAD s/p CABG:  No signs of MI at this time, CK flat with negative
   troponin.  Not on BB, ACE-I as outpatient.
   - not on ASA at home, hold ASA given INR elevation
   - hold Statin give elevated LFTs
   # Depression: cont buproprion, citalopram

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, who presented with weakness for 10 days and was found to have sepsis. He has a background of chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%) and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) due to ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient's current condition includes acute-on-chronic heart failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, liver function abnormalities, and hyponatremia. 

The plan includes continuing vancomycin for sepsis, broadening antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia if respiratory status worsens, and consulting with cardiology regarding the ICD settings and potential dobutamine use. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, septic shock, liver failure, renal failure, and hypoglycemia."

   CHF (EF 20%), hx of VT s/p PPM/ICD in [**2144**], Afib on Coumadin,
   Hyperlipidemia who presents from home with weakness x 10 days found to
   have sepsis.
   # Sepsis/bacterimia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 10380**] presented with lactate of 11.9, Afib
   with RVR to 140s and leukocytosis of 14.3 all consistent with sepsis.
   Blood cultures now growing out gram + cocci, 4/4 bottles but have since
   cleared.  Will cont with Vanco, source is possibly left foot
   ulcerations.  Xray showed no signs of osteo.  Growing MSSA.
   -- cont Vanco, check level; has pcn allergy and would just like to
   continue vanco despite MSSA growing out
   -- f/u Blood Cx
   -- f/u Podiatry consult
 ABIs pending
   -- f/u Vascular consult
   # Acute on Chronic CHF:  Patient with history of chronic CHF, s/p IVF
   and crackles in lungs which are consistent with fluid overload.
   - had CVL placed and dopamine and lasix gtt started overnight; UOP has
   increased with this change
   - follow UOP
 goal -1L output today
   - cont midodrine
   # Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic. Improving from 122 to 128 with diuresis.
   - q6h Na
   - consider tolvaptan
   - renal cosult
   # Transaminitis:  Unclear etiology at this time but may be related to
   sepsis and mild shock liver as lactate 11.9.  CT done and shows no
   biliary cause.   Hepatology consulted, appreciate recs
   -- trend LFTs/coags daily
   -- restart Amiodarone
   -- hold statin for now
   -- plan for liver US tomorrow to rule out portal thrombosis
   # Coagluopathy: Likely a consequence of abx, poor po and liver injury;
   was not on anticoagulation at home
   - vit K 1 mg again today
   # ARF:  Likely related to sepsis, Cr stable
   -- q6h Cr and Lytes today
   -- inoptropes as above
   -- renal c/s
   -- avoid nephrotoxic medication
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology; likely related to metabolic
   encephalopathy, vs. hepatic encephalopathy, vs. poor perfusion, vs.
   hypoglycemia vs. ICU delirium.
   - monitor for focal neurological deficits; none now
   - treat medical problems as above
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: likely from poor PO intake and liver failure
   - D50 boluses PRN; trying to avoid too much fluid so no gtt
   # Afib with RVR: Currently, patient is in Afib with normal rate s/p
   fluids.  Currently not on Coumadin, but INR elevated, likely [**1-1**] liver
   dysfunction.
   - resume amiodarone
   - metoprolol if tolerated
   - hold anticoagulation as INR elevated
   # ICD firing:  per patient, ICD fired x 2.  EP consulted in ED and
   pacer interrogated, no Vtach noted, patient has been in afib with RVR
   over the weekend.
   - f/u EP consult; will talk with EP about if pacer is catching HRs
   above 100; looks like they are
   - amiodarone as above
   # CAD s/p CABG:  No signs of MI at this time, CK flat with negative
   troponin.  Not on BB, ACE-I as outpatient.
   - not on ASA at home, hold ASA given INR elevation
   - hold Statin give elevated LFTs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with weakness and was found to have sepsis. The patient has multiple medical conditions including heart failure, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and a cardiac dysrhythmia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/76 mmHg to 122/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin. The patient has an impaired skin integrity, likely due to pressure ulcers.

The patient's recent history includes a myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), upper gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic systolic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has multiple medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, warfarin, levothyroxine, and others.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and depression. He presented to the hospital with weakness and was found to have sepsis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoglycemia, diastolic heart failure, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and impaired skin integrity. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of organ dysfunction.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and may now be experiencing acute decompensation. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other parts of the body. Monitoring his fluid status and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed is essential.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and is at risk for acute renal failure. It is important to monitor renal function and avoid nephrotoxic medications. Consultation with a nephrologist may be necessary.
4. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating potential liver injury. Further evaluation is needed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), previous ventricular tachycardia, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, and depression. He presents with weakness for 10 days and was found to have sepsis. He is currently in cardiogenic shock and has multiple medical complications including hypoglycemia, liver function abnormalities, renal failure, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is dependent on inotropes and requires continued neosynepherin and dopamine. Attempt transition to dobutamine and consider a Swan-Ganz catheter for further monitoring.
2. Sepsis/bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and worsening hypotension. Continue vancomycin and add meropenem for broader coverage. Consult podiatry and vascular services for foot wound management.
3. Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic hyponatremia is related to heart failure. Diurese if stable.
4. Transaminitis: Unclear etiology but may be related to sepsis and mild shock liver. Trend LFTs/coags daily and consult hepatology.
5. Coagulopathy: Likely a consequence of antibiotics, poor PO intake, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, chronic systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the hospital with weakness and was found to have sepsis. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and requires isotropic support. He also has liver function abnormalities, renal failure, hypoglycemia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities including CAD, chronic CHF, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's heart failure has progressed to cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition where the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
2. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has presented with MSSA bacteremia, and despite antibiotic treatment, his hypotension is worsening, indicating a potential septic shock.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hypervolemic hyponatremia related to heart failure. This condition can lead to neurological complications if not corrected properly.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to sepsis and mild shock liver. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder, likely due to antibiotic therapy, poor oral intake, and liver injury. This"

   septic shock c/b CHF.  .
   1. Shock
 cannot r/o recrudescent sepsis given that wound has not been
   definitively treated.  Prior hypothermia could be c/w ongiong sepsis.
   CXR also shows inc density and question whether there may be LLL
   consolidation/collapse.  With those caveats, his CHF and severe
   valvular disease continue to be the most clearly complicating and
   likely represent a primary etiology for shock.  Yesterday failed trial
   of neosynephrine alone and HR dropped to 72 bpm.  No improvement in
   hemodynamics with this intervention.   Although we have discussed a PA
   line will attempt trial of dobutamine/neosynephrine.
   -Dobutamine/neo as above, follow Uo, CvO2, CVP, and possibly CO via
   Vigi.
   -Vancomycin x 14days, meropenem x2.  If improves may need TEE for
   further to exonerate cardiac valves.
   2. Respiratory failure
 likely [**1-1**] worsening CHF in the setting of
   cardiogenic failure.  Maintained on 50% FiO2, P/F ratio is 368 so no
   indication for low tidal vol vent, particularly in the setting likely
   inc PCWP.
   -inc PEEP
   3. Sepsis-  [**1-1**] MSSA, high grade bacteremia.  Likely source is from
   foot wound.  Continued on vancomycin/meropenem.
   4. CHF
 LVEF20%.
   5. Thrombocytopenia

 now stable.
   6. Transaminitis

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), ventricular tachycardia with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, atrial fibrillation, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and chronic systolic congestive heart failure. The patient presents with weakness for 10 days, hypotension, tachycardia, elevated lactate levels, low glucose, and transaminitis. He is currently sedated and unable to provide history.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to worsening congestive heart failure in the setting of cardiogenic shock. He is maintained on 50% FiO2, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 368. There is no indication for low tidal volume ventilation, particularly in the setting of likely increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).

The patient also has sepsis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), high-grade bacteremia, likely originating from a foot wound. He is continued on vancomycin and meropenem.

Additionally, the patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%. He also has thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis (AG acidosis), hyponatremia, transaminitis (liver"

   definitively treated.  Prior hypothermia could be c/w ongiong sepsis.
   CXR also shows inc density and question whether there may be LLL
   consolidation/collapse.  With those caveats, his CHF and severe
   valvular disease continue to be the most clearly complicating and
   likely represent a primary etiology for shock.  Yesterday failed trial
   of neosynephrine alone and HR dropped to 72 bpm.  No improvement in
   hemodynamics with this intervention.   Although we have discussed a PA
   line will attempt trial of dobutamine/neosynephrine.
   -Dobutamine/neo as above, follow Uo, CvO2, CVP, and possibly CO via
   Vigi.
   -Vancomycin x 14days, meropenem x2.  If improves may need TEE for
   further to exonerate cardiac valves.
   2. Respiratory failure
 likely [**1-1**] worsening CHF in the setting of
   cardiogenic failure.  Maintained on 50% FiO2, P/F ratio is 368 so no
   indication for low tidal vol vent, particularly in the setting likely
   inc PCWP.
   -inc PEEP
   3. Sepsis-  [**1-1**] MSSA, high grade bacteremia.  Likely source is from
   foot wound.  Continued on vancomycin/meropenem.
   4. CHF
 LVEF20%.
   5. Thrombocytopenia
   6. AG acidosis-
   5. Hyponatremia
 now stable.
   6. Transaminitis
 LFTs stable.  Portal vv thrombosis ruled out, c/w
   hepatic congestion/hepatopathy.
   7. Lactate- partially related to production. Type I and Type II?

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Critical Care Attending:
   Patient admitted to MICU with hypotension and respiratory failure, gram
   positive bacteremia (MSSA), acute renal failure,
   Patient remains pressor dependent (phenylephrine and dopamine); didn
   tolerate dobutamine. Urine output a bit better on dopamine.
   On exam, patient intubated and sedated. Chest clear with good air
   movement anteriorally and laterally. Heart sounds soft. No gallop or
   murmur. Abdomen distended. No tenderness or guarding. Capillary refill
   slightly delayed. Extremties warm; 2+ edema of thighs.
   Hypotension probably due to a combination of low SVR from infection and
   inadequate cardiac output due to cardiac disease. On dopamine and
   phenylephrine now. Would add vasopressin. Oyxgenation remains good.
   Urine output marginal. Creat up slightl. CVP remains high.
   Critical Care 30 mins.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%), and ventricular tachycardia (VT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presents with respiratory failure and shock.

The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has had multiple episodes of hypotension, tachycardia, high lactate levels, and altered mental status. He was found to have sepsis and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). He is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50% and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 368.

His vital signs show hypotension (BP 84/58 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 92 bpm), normal respiratory rate (RR 16 breaths/min), and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on multiple pressors including dopamine and phenylephrine, and his urine output is improving.

The patient's blood work shows leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.2 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 32.1%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt of 196,000/mm3, elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, and liver"

   62 yom with history of CAD s/p CABG x 5 in [**2144**], UGIB, Chronic Systolic
   CHF (EF 20%), hx of VT s/p PPM/ICD in [**2144**], Afib on Coumadin,
   Hyperlipidemia who presents from home with weakness x 10 days found to
   have sepsis.
   # Cardiogenic shock: Did not improve with decreased rate suggesting
   that he is very dependent on ionotrophy.
   - continue neosynepherin and dopamine; attempt transition to dobutamine
   - attempt diuresis if stable
   - appreciate cardiology input
   - check lactate/SvO2 prior to changing pressors.
   - consider vigelleo (but Afib and bad tracing) or swan
   .
   # Sepsis/bacterimia:  Presented with MSSA bacteremia.  With 4/4 blood
   culture bottles positive and same organism growing from foot wound.
   Given worsening hypotension, added meropenem for broader coverage.
   - cont Vanco, check level; has pcn allergy and would just like to
   continue vanco despite MSSA growing out
   - meropenem for other foot/pulmonary sources, will attempt 8 day
   coursefrom [**10-26**]
   -- f/u Podiatry consult
   -- f/u Vascular consult
   -- TTE/TEE to determine course
   # Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic, related to heart failure Improving from
   122 to 129, stable over last day since diuresis has leveled off
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Transaminitis:  Unclear etiology at this time but may be related to
   sepsis and mild shock liver as lactate 11.9.  CT done and shows no
   biliary cause.   Hepatology consulted, appreciate recs.  No portal
   thrombosis.  LFTs stable
   - trend LFTs/coags daily
   - restart Amiodarone
   - hold statin for now
   - start lactulose
   # Coagluopathy: Likely a consequence of abx, poor po and liver injury;
   was not on anticoagulation at home
   - repeat dose vit K 3mg
   # ARF:  Likely related to sepsis, Cr stable
   -- inoptropes as above; stable despite worsening heart failure
   -- renal c/s
   -- avoid nephrotoxic medication
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: likely from poor PO intake and liver failure
   - tube feeds and D50 prn
   # Afib with RVR: Currently, patient is in Afib with normal rate s/p
   fluids.  Currently not on Coumadin, but INR elevated, likely [**1-1**] liver
   dysfunction.
   - amiodarone
   - hold anticoagulation as INR elevated
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:  No signs of MI at this time, CK flat with negative
   troponin.  Not on BB, ACE-I as outpatient.
   - not on ASA at home, hold ASA given INR elevation
   - hold Statin give elevated LFTs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on Coumadin, hyperlipidemia, and weakness for the past 10 days diagnosed with sepsis. The patient presented with weakness and was found to have sepsis.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient did not improve with decreased rate, suggesting that he is very dependent on inotropic support. The plan is to continue with neo-synepherin and dopamine, attempt transition to dobutamine, attempt diuresis if stable, appreciate cardiology input, check lactate/SvO2 prior to changing pressors, and consider a Swan-Ganz catheter.

2. Sepsis/bacteremia: The patient presented with MSSA bacteremia. With worsening hypotension, meropenem was added for broader coverage. The plan is to continue vancomycin, check its level, and attempt an 8-day course of meropenem for other foot/pulmonary sources. A podiatry consult, vascular consult, and transt"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of severe congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), depression, hypothyroidism, and amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism. The patient presented with cardiogenic/septic shock and was found to have MSSA bacteremia. He has been in the ICU since 10/26 and is currently sedated and ventilated.

24-hour events:
- Attempted to transition dopamine to dobutamine in the AM yesterday, which failed due to falling blood pressure.
- Kept on dopamine/NEO combination as it was producing urine without lasix. Added vasopressin in the evening in an effort to wean other pressors.
- PEEP increased to 8 for preload and afterload reduction.
- ECHO showed worsening of mitral regurgitation (MR) and mild interval improvement of wall motion abnormalities likely secondary to sepsis/pressors.
- High residuals, reglan started.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill.
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), upper gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), ventricular tachycardia with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, atrial fibrillation. He presents with weakness for 10 days and is now experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, elevated lactate levels, and transaminitis. The patient is septic with a likely source being his foot wound. He has acute respiratory failure, severe congestive heart failure, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and lactate elevation. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's condition is complicated by septic shock, which may be due to an untreated wound infection. There is also evidence of worsening heart failure, making it difficult to rule out recurrent sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory failure, likely secondary to cardiogenic shock and new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.
3. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), likely originating from the foot wound. Antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) have been initiated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) post pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), presenting from home with weakness for 10 days. The patient was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic, with elevated lactate levels, low glucose levels, and transaminitis.

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been sedated. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. He has been diagnosed with septic shock likely secondary to chronic heart failure and severe valvular disease. There is a new right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a possible worsening of CHF. The patient has been started on dobutamine, neosynephrine, and vasopressin infusions. He is also receiving vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics for suspected methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia from his non-healing left foot wound.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure likely due to worsening CHF"

   # Cardiogenic shock: Appears to be the primary driver of his shock
   given hepatic congestion/bounding JVP. Unable to switch to dobutamine
   from dopamine yesterday.  New TTE did not show blown valve or
   significant worsening. Falling Cr may indicate improved forward flow.
   - continue neosynepherin and dopamine, vasopressin; attempt to wean
   neosynephrine

   122 to 129, stable over last day since diuresis has leveled off
   - appreciate renal recs
   - Recheck lytes tonight
   # Transaminitis:  Shock liver likely contributing with hepatic venous
   congestion given 4+ TR and bounding JVP. Appears to be having worsening
   synthetic function with rising bilirubin. Will also check U/s for
   possible obstruction.
   - RUQ U/S
   - trend LFTs/coags daily
   - restart Amiodarone
   - hold statin for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), biventricular pacer, and septic shock. He has persistent fever, increased tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased urine output overnight. The patient has allergies to penicillins and amiodarone. He received various antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient is currently sedated and intubated with a RASS score of -4. His vital signs show a high temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, normal respiratory rate, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced. 

His hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 18 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 57%, total input of 3,050 mL, and total output of 2,270 mL. The patient's urine output is 720 mL, and his blood products' total out is 2,270 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and autoflow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, and plateau pressure (Pplat) of 21 cmH2O. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.8 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 32.8%, normal platelet count (Plt) of 123 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 2.4 mg/dL, low TCO2 of 19, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated ALT/AST and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos). 

Assessment and plan:
1. Severe septic shock: The patient likely has a source of infection, possibly in the foot or lungs. He is on maximum doses of dopamine, neomycin, and vasopressin. The family desires no escalation of care.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a low scavenged oxygen saturation (ScvO2) of 50-55% and an underlying poor ejection fraction (EF).
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is increasing, and he remains oliguric. This may be due to decreased cardiac output in the setting of CHF.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is on amiodarone.

ICU care:
- Nutrition: Holding tube feeds due to high residuals.
- Glycemic control: 
- Lines: Multi-lumen and arterial line.
- Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Communication: Discussing goals of care with the family due to the patient's refractory shock, underlying cardiac comorbidities, and no escalation of care/DNR status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, particularly in the heart, kidneys, and liver.
2. Respiratory complications due to mechanical ventilation.
3. Further deterioration of cardiac function leading to cardiac arrest.
4. Development of renal failure.
5. Infection at the site of IV lines or catheters.
6. Stress ulceration due to prolonged immobilization and critical illness.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), biventricular pacemaker, and currently admitted with septic shock. The patient's fever, increased tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased urine output overnight indicate persistent septic shock. The patient's family has decided against escalating care.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. His vital signs show persistent fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and low respiratory rate. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 304, indicating severe hypoxemia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated levels of AST and ALT. The patient's serum creatinine is increasing, indicating renal failure. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals sedation, intubation, and reduced breath sounds at the right base with clear anterior fields. The patient's extremities are cold, and he has anasarca (generalized swelling).

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), who has been admitted to the ICU for septic shock. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with persistent fever, increased tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased urine output. Despite being on maximum dopamine and vasopressin, the patient's ScvO2 levels remain low, indicating ongoing shock. The patient's renal function is also compromised, as evidenced by increasing creatinine levels and oliguria. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is still dependent on mechanical ventilation. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with amiodarone. The patient's wife has expressed a desire to move towards comfort measures only (CMO) status, and discussions have been held regarding deactivating the ICD, extubation, and removal of vasopressors.

Potential medical complications:
1. Severe septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to a foot or pulmonary infection. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient remains pressor-dependent, indicating a severe and potentially life-threatening condition.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's underlying poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the overdilation of the left ventricle contribute to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO), leading to cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: Although the patient"
