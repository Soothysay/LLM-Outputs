   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including chronic aspiration,
   afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who presents with hypoxia, consistent
   with PNA and possible septic shock and well as potential CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to CHF, although
   probably has component of infection.  Patient is a chronic aspirator
   per report and could have aspiration pneumonia.  Intubated in the
   emergency room.  Is tolerating the vent well on AC 50%, Vt 500, and
   PEEP of 5.
   - pneumonia treatment as below for HAP
   - continue mechanical ventilation; wean as possible, RISB in AM
   - hold on diuresis for now in setting of hypotension
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: unclear etiology, could be either secondary to
   septic shock from PNA infection vs. cardiogenic shock from CHF.  Most
   likely component of sepsis or hypovolemia based on high Na and high Cr
   from baseline.
   - fluid resuccitate with free water
   - wean of levofed as tolerated for MAP >60
   - follow lactates
   .
   # Pneumonia: continue mechanical ventilation.  Treat as HAP as he is
   coming from an institution.
   - vanco/zosyn for broad coverage
   - sputum, blood cultures
   - consider flagyl if decompensating for aspiration
   - Will place PICC for likely prolonged antibiotic course and limited IV
   access
   .
   # NSTEMI: troponin leak, likely demand ischemia, had EKG changes with
   ST depression in precordial leads.
   - asa 325 mg daily, no heparin necessary
   - high dose statin
   - holding BB and ACEI in setting of hypotension
   - trend CEs
   - echo in AM
   .
   # CHF: echo last [**Month (only) **] showed mild hypokinesis and CXR consistent with
   fluid overload.  Rales on exam.  Likely component of his respiratory
   failure.  Hypotension resolved with 3 L NS and PRBCs.
   - hold on diuresis given hypotension
   - levofed as needed for now
   - echo in AM
   .
   # Afib: has hx of afib on coumadin, now is in NSR.
   - restart coumadin tomorrow if hct stable
   .
   # Anemia: has hct of 21 from baseline of high 20s to 30.  Unclear
   etiology of bleed. Has had transient lows like this in the past.
   - s/p 2 units of PRBCs
   - trend hcts q12hrs

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents, and coronary artery disease.
- He presented with hypoxia, consistent with possible pneumonia and septic shock, as well as potential congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient was intubated in the emergency room and is tolerating mechanical ventilation well with an FiO2 of 50%, Vt of 500 mL, and PEEP of 5.
- The assessment and plan include treating pneumonia as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), continuing mechanical ventilation with weaning as possible, holding on diuretics for now due to hypotension, repeating a chest X-ray in the morning, fluid resuscitation with free water, weaning off levofed as tolerated for mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, following lactates, and considering Flagyl if decompensating for aspiration.
- The patient also has hypotension/shock, likely secondary to septic shock from pneumonia infection or cardiogenic shock from CHF. Fluid resuscitation with free water, weaning off levofed as tolerated for MAP >60, and following lactates are part of the plan.
- Other issues include NSTEMI, CHF, atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypernatremia, urinary tract infection, sacral decubitus ulcer"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with hypoxia, consistent with pneumonia and possible septic shock, as well as potential congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient has been intubated and is currently tolerating mechanical ventilation well on an airway pressure control mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The respiratory system assessment reveals clear breath sounds with crackles at the bases and transmitted vent sounds.

Vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 92 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 147/62 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mL and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 92 mmHg.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including chronic aspiration,
   afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who presents with hypoxia, consistent
   with PNA and possible septic shock and well as potential CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to CHF, although
   probably has component of infection.  Patient is a chronic aspirator
   per report and could have aspiration pneumonia.  Intubated in the
   emergency room.  Is tolerating the vent well on AC 50%, Vt 500, and
   PEEP of 5.
   - pneumonia treatment as below for HAP
   - continue mechanical ventilation; wean as possible, RISB in AM
   - hold on diuresis for now in setting of hypotension
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: unclear etiology, could be either secondary to
   septic shock from PNA infection vs. cardiogenic shock from CHF.  Most
   likely component of sepsis or hypovolemia based on high Na and high Cr
   from baseline.
   - fluid resuccitate with free water
   - wean of levofed as tolerated for MAP >60
   - follow lactates
   .
   # Pneumonia: continue mechanical ventilation.  Treat as HAP as he is
   coming from an institution.
   - vanco/zosyn for broad coverage
   - sputum, blood cultures
   - consider flagyl if decompensating for aspiration
   .
   # NSTEMI: troponin leak, likely demand ischemia, had EKG changes with
   ST depression in precordial leads.
   - asa 325 mg daily, no heparin necessary
   - high dose statin
   - holding BB and ACEI in setting of hypotension
   - trend CEs
   - echo in AM
   .
   # CHF: echo last [**Month (only) **] showed mild hypokinesis and CXR consistent with
   fluid overload.  Rales on exam.  Likely component of his respiratory
   failure.  Hypotension resolved with 3 L NS and PRBCs.
   - hold on diuresis given hypotension
   - levofed as needed for now
   - echo in AM
   .
   # Afib: has hx of afib on coumadin, now is in NSR.
   - restart coumadin tomorrow if hct stable
   .
   # Anemia: has hct of 21 from baseline of high 20s to 30.  Unclear
   etiology of bleed. Has had transient lows like this in the past.
   - s/p 2 units of PRBCs
   - trend hcts q6hrs
   - guiac all stools
   .
   # DM: stable
   - ISS
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from poor PO intake and free water deficit.
   - D5W overnight, trend Na
   .
   # UTI: has dirty UA, will follow culture.  Above abx should cover
   urinary pathogens.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: wound consult today
   .
   # Dementia: unclear baseline, hold mirtazapine while sedated.
   .
   # FEN: IVFs, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: on coumadin, famotidine
   # Access: fem line, art line
   # Communication: has two daughters and son; [**Doctor Last Name **] is HCP and could not
   get a hold of HCP.  [**Name (NI) 792**], daughter was reached and had verbal consent
   for blood.  [**Doctor First Name 792**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12035**], will call in AM.  Should also consider
   talking to PCP about code and mental status.
   # Code:  Full per discussion in ED
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presents with hypoxia, consistent with pneumonia and possible septic shock as well as potential congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was intubated in the emergency room and is tolerating the ventilator well on assist control (AC) 50%, tidal volume (Vt) 500 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to CHF, although there is a component of infection. Chronic aspiration could also contribute to aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which will be continued. Weaning will be done as possible, with a respiratory intensity index (RSBI) to be evaluated in the morning.
2. Hypotension/Shock: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear, but it could be due to septic shock from pneumonia infection or cardiogenic shock from CHF. Another possibility is hypovolemia based on high sodium (Na+) and creatinine (Cr) levels from baseline. Fluid resuscitation with free water and weaning of levofed as tolerated for mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 are recommended"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including chronic aspiration,
   afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who presents with hypoxia, consistent
   with PNA and possible septic shock and well as potential CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to CHF, although
   probably has component of infection.  Patient is a chronic aspirator
   per report and could have aspiration pneumonia.  Intubated in the
   emergency room.  Is tolerating the vent well on AC 50%, Vt 500, and
   PEEP of 5.
   - pneumonia treatment as below for HAP
   - continue mechanical ventilation; wean as possible, RISB in AM
   - hold on diuresis for now in setting of hypotension
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: unclear etiology, could be either secondary to
   septic shock from PNA infection vs. cardiogenic shock from CHF.  Most
   likely component of sepsis or hypovolemia based on high Na and high Cr
   from baseline.
   - fluid resuccitate with free water
   - wean of levofed as tolerated for MAP >60
   - follow lactates
   .
   # Pneumonia: continue mechanical ventilation.  Treat as HAP as he is
   coming from an institution.
   - vanco/zosyn for broad coverage
   - sputum, blood cultures
   - consider flagyl if decompensating for aspiration
   .
   # NSTEMI: troponin leak, likely demand ischemia, had EKG changes with
   ST depression in precordial leads.
   - asa 325 mg daily, no heparin necessary
   - high dose statin
   - holding BB and ACEI in setting of hypotension
   - trend CEs
   - echo in AM
   .
   # CHF: echo last [**Month (only) **] showed mild hypokinesis and CXR consistent with
   fluid overload.  Rales on exam.  Likely component of his respiratory
   failure.  Hypotension resolved with 3 L NS and PRBCs.
   - hold on diuresis given hypotension
   - levofed as needed for now
   - echo in AM
   .
   # Afib: has hx of afib on coumadin, now is in NSR.
   - restart coumadin tomorrow if hct stable
   .
   # Anemia: has hct of 21 from baseline of high 20s to 30.  Unclear
   etiology of bleed. Has had transient lows like this in the past.
   - s/p 2 units of PRBCs
   - trend hcts q6hrs
   - guiac all stools
   .
   # DM: stable
   - ISS
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from poor PO intake and free water deficit.
   - D5W overnight, trend Na
   .
   # UTI: has dirty UA, will follow culture.  Above abx should cover
   urinary pathogens.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: wound consult today
   .
   # Dementia: unclear baseline, hold mirtazapine while sedated.
   .
   # FEN: IVFs, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: on coumadin, famotidine
   # Access: fem line, art line
   # Communication: has two daughters and son; [**Doctor Last Name **] is HCP and could not
   get a hold of HCP.  [**Name (NI) 792**], daughter was reached and had verbal consent
   for blood.  [**Doctor First Name 792**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12035**], will call in AM.  Should also consider
   talking to PCP about code and mental status.
   # Code:  Full per discussion in ED

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with hypoxia consistent with possible pneumonia and septic shock, as well as potential congestive heart failure (CHF).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to CHF, although there is a component of infection. The patient is tolerating the ventilator well on assist-control (AC) 50%, tidal volume (Vt) 500 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, wean as possible, and monitor respiratory rate, inspiratory time, and spontaneous breathing effort (RSBI) in the morning. Pneumonia treatment will be provided as for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for broad coverage, and consideration of Flagyl if the patient is decompensating for aspiration. Repeat chest X-ray will be done in the morning.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear, and could be secondary to septic shock from pneumonia infection or cardiogenic shock from CHF. The most likely"

   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including chronic aspiration,
   afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who presents with hypoxia, consistent
   with PNA and possible septic shock and well as potential CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to CHF, although
   probably has component of infection.  Patient is a chronic aspirator
   per report and could have aspiration pneumonia.  Intubated in the
   emergency room.  Extubated 2 days ago, and CXR with possible worsening
   fluid overload.
   - pneumonia treatment as below for HAP
   - lasix 20 mg IV x1 with goal net negative 1 L
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: unclear etiology, could be either secondary to
   septic shock from PNA infection vs. cardiogenic shock from CHF.  Now
   improved. Most likely component of sepsis or hypovolemia based on high
   Na and high Cr from baseline.
   - fluid resuccitate with free water
   - wean of levofed as tolerated for MAP >60
   - follow lactates
   .
   # Pneumonia: Extubated successfully  Treat as HAP as he is coming from
   an institution.
   - vanco/zosyn for broad coverage
   - sputum, blood cultures
   - consider flagyl if decompensating for aspiration
   - picc placed for IV abx
   .
   # NSTEMI: troponin leak, likely demand ischemia now downtrending, had
   EKG changes with ST depression in precordial leads. Peak 1.82,
   - asa 325 mg daily, no heparin necessary
   - high dose statin
   - restart BB
   - restart ACEI
   .
   # CHF: echo last [**Month (only) **] showed mild hypokinesis and CXR consistent with
   fluid overload.  Rales on exam.  Likely component of his respiratory
   failure.  Hypotension resolved with 3 L NS and PRBCs. Echo with stable
   EF.
   - hold on diuresis given hypotension
   - levofed as needed for now
   - lasix as above
   - restart Ace-I
   .
   # Afib: has hx of afib on coumadin, now is in NSR.
   - hold Coumadin for supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # Anemia: has hct of 21 from baseline of high 20s to 30.  Unclear
   etiology of bleed. Has had transient lows like this in the past.
   - s/p 4 units of PRBCs
   - trend hcts q12hrs
   - guiac all stools
   .
   # DM: stable
   - ISS
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from poor PO intake and 4L free water deficit.
   Na improved.
   - trend lytes
   .
   # UTI: has dirty UA, will follow culture.  Above abx should cover
   urinary pathogens.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with hypoxia consistent with pneumonia and possible septic shock, as well as potential congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient was intubated in the emergency room due to respiratory failure and extubated two days ago. The chest X-ray showed possible worsening fluid overload. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 149/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 3,119 mL input and 915 mL output, with a net positive fluid balance of 2,204 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes a face tent, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set at a tidal volume (Vt) of 483 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.38, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 254.

The patient's physical examination reveals no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and metoprolol. 

Laboratory results show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 98 mg/dL, slightly low potassium levels at 3.8 mEq/L, low magnesium at 1.1 mg/dL, and low hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has a history of chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, CVAs, and CAD.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to CHF, although there is also a component of infection. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and extubated two days ago. The chest X-ray shows possible worsening fluid overload.
   - Treatment for pneumonia will be provided as HAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia) since the patient is coming from an institution.
   - Lasix 20 mg IV will be given to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1 L.
2. Hypotension/Shock: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He was extubated and did well initially, with improving hyponatremia. A PICC line was placed, and the fem line was discontinued. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) initially trended upwards. Metoprolol was restarted due to a blood pressure of 160-170 mmHg. The patient received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for antibiotic coverage. Pantoprazole was also administered. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.

Flowsheet Data:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate is 84 bpm (82-95 bpm), blood pressure is 149/61 mmHg (93/43-164/66 mmHg), respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute (10-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Total input is 3,119 mL and total output is 915 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,204 mL. Urine output is 915 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including chronic aspiration,
   afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who presents with hypoxia, consistent
   with PNA and possible septic shock and well as potential CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to CHF, although
   probably has component of infection.  Patient is a chronic aspirator
   per report and could have aspiration pneumonia.  Intubated in the
   emergency room.  Extubated yesterday, tolerating well.
   - pneumonia treatment as below for HAP
   - continue mechanical ventilation; wean as possible, RISB in AM
   - hold on diuresis for now in setting of hypotension
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: unclear etiology, could be either secondary to
   septic shock from PNA infection vs. cardiogenic shock from CHF.  Most
   likely component of sepsis or hypovolemia based on high Na and high Cr
   from baseline.
   - fluid resuccitate with free water
   - wean of levofed as tolerated for MAP >60
   - follow lactates
   .
   # Pneumonia: continue mechanical ventilation.  Treat as HAP as he is
   coming from an institution.
   - vanco/zosyn for broad coverage
   - sputum, blood cultures
   - consider flagyl if decompensating for aspiration
   - Will place PICC for likely prolonged antibiotic course and limited IV
   access
   .
   # NSTEMI: troponin leak, likely demand ischemia, had EKG changes with
   ST depression in precordial leads. Peak 1.82, trending down.
   - asa 325 mg daily, no heparin necessary
   - high dose statin
   - holding BB and ACEI in setting of hypotension
   - trend CEs
   - echo in AM
   .
   # CHF: echo last [**Month (only) **] showed mild hypokinesis and CXR consistent with
   fluid overload.  Rales on exam.  Likely component of his respiratory
   failure.  Hypotension resolved with 3 L NS and PRBCs.
   - hold on diuresis given hypotension
   - levofed as needed for now
   - echo in AM
   .
   # Afib: has hx of afib on coumadin, now is in NSR.
   - restart coumadin tomorrow if hct stable
   .
   # Anemia: has hct of 21 from baseline of high 20s to 30.  Unclear
   etiology of bleed. Has had transient lows like this in the past.
   - s/p 2 units of PRBCs
   - trend hcts q12hrs
   - guiac all stools
   .
   # DM: stable
   - ISS
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from poor PO intake and 4L free water deficit
   - D5W overnight, trend Na
   - Will check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI: has dirty UA, will follow culture.  Above abx should cover
   urinary pathogens.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with hypoxia consistent with pneumonia and possible septic shock, as well as potential congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to CHF, although there is also a component of infection. The patient has chronic aspiration, which could have led to aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated in the emergency room and extubated yesterday, tolerating well.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension could be due to septic shock from pneumonia infection or cardiogenic shock from CHF. It is unclear which component is more likely. The patient has been fluid resuscitated with free water and will have weaning of levofed as tolerated for mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, likely healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) given his institutional background. He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Sputum and blood cultures have been obtained, and flagyl may be considered if he decompensates for aspiration. A PICC line has been placed for a likely prolonged antibiotic course and limited"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is pneumonia/hypoxemia and septic shock. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, and a PICC line has been started. The patient's allergies are unknown, and they have been receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam). The patient is currently on multiple infusions, including Pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications per the ICU team.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for dyspnea, which is now absent. The patient reports no fever, pain, or genitourinary issues. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/46-143/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.1-12.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, platelet count of 137-169 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin T level of 1.70-1.82 ng/mL, blood glucose level of 107-127 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal breath sounds with rhonchi throughout the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia, septic shock, anemia, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and other issues per the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to impaired skin integrity, further cardiac complications related to the NSTEMI, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility, stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential bleeding complications from the new PICC site."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including chronic aspiration,
   afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who presents with hypoxia, consistent
   with PNA and possible septic shock and well as potential CHF.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to CHF, although
   probably has component of infection.  Patient is a chronic aspirator
   per report and could have aspiration pneumonia.  Intubated in the
   emergency room.  Extubated 2 days ago, and CXR with possible worsening
   fluid overload.
   - pneumonia treatment as below for HAP
   - lasix 20 mg IV x1 with goal net negative 1 L
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: unclear etiology, could be either secondary to
   septic shock from PNA infection vs. cardiogenic shock from CHF.  Now
   improved. Most likely component of sepsis or hypovolemia based on high
   Na and high Cr from baseline.
   - resolved, now Pt somewhat hypertensive
   - Home BP meds resumed
   .
   # Pneumonia: Extubated successfully  Treat as HAP as he is coming from
   an institution.
   - vanco/zosyn for broad coverage
   - sputum, blood cultures
   - consider flagyl if decompensating for aspiration
   - picc placed for IV abx
   .
   # NSTEMI: troponin leak, likely demand ischemia now downtrending, had
   EKG changes with ST depression in precordial leads. Peak 1.82,
   - asa 325 mg daily, no heparin necessary
   - high dose statin
   - restart BB
   - restart ACEI
   .
   # CHF: echo last [**Month (only) **] showed mild hypokinesis and CXR consistent with
   fluid overload.  Rales on exam.  Likely component of his respiratory
   failure.  Hypotension resolved with 3 L NS and PRBCs. Echo with stable
   EF.
   - I/O even yesterday. Will diurese w/ lasix again this AM.
   - restarted  Ace-I this AM
   .
   # Afib: has hx of afib on coumadin, now is in NSR.
   - hold Coumadin for supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # Anemia: has hct of 21 from baseline of high 20s to 30.  Unclear
   etiology of bleed. Has had transient lows like this in the past.
   - s/p 4 units of PRBCs
   - trend hcts q12hrs
   - guiac all stools
   .
   # DM: stable
   - ISS
   .
   # Hypernatremia: likely from poor PO intake and 4L free water deficit.
   Na improved.
   - trend lytes
   .
   # UTI: has dirty UA, will follow culture.  Above abx should cover
   urinary pathogens.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: wound consult today
   .
   # Dementia: unclear baseline, hold mirtazapine for now .
   .
   # FEN: IVFs, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: on coumadin, famotidine
   # Access: picc line, art line
   # Communication: has two daughters and son; [**Doctor Last Name **] is HCP and could not
   get a hold of HCP.  [**Name (NI) 792**], daughter was reached and had verbal consent
   for blood.  [**Doctor First Name 792**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12035**], will call in AM.  Should also consider
   talking to PCP about code and mental status.
   # Code:  Full per discussion in ED
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement, call out to floor in

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presents with hypoxia, consistent with pneumonia and possible septic shock as well as potential congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient was intubated in the emergency room and later extubated successfully. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to CHF and possibly infection. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has shown improvement. 

There is uncertainty regarding the etiology of his hypotension and shock, which could be due to septic shock from pneumonia infection or cardiogenic shock from CHF. However, his blood pressure has improved and he is now normotensive to hypertensive. 

The patient also has evidence of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with troponin leakage and EKG changes indicating demand ischemia. 

He has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, which may be due to chronic blood loss as indicated by a previous low hemoglobin level. 

The patient's sodium levels are high, likely due to poor oral intake and a 4L free water deficit. 

He has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a dirty urinalysis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with hypoxia consistent with pneumonia and possible septic shock, as well as potential congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient was intubated in the emergency room and later extubated two days ago. A chest X-ray showed possible worsening fluid overload. He is currently being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

The patient's hypotension and shock are unclear in etiology, but could be secondary to septic shock from pneumonia infection or cardiogenic shock from CHF. His troponin levels indicate a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and he has EKG changes with ST depression in precordial leads. 

The patient also has evidence of CHF, with an echo showing mild hypokinesis and rales on examination. His blood pressure resolved with 3 liters of normal saline and packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

Additionally, the patient had atrial fibrillation but is now in sinus rhythm. His INR was supratherapeutic, so he was held on Coumadin. 

The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) of 21, down from his baseline of high 20s to 30. The etiology of the bleed is unclear, and he received 4 units of PRBCs. 

Other findings include hypernatremia, likely from poor oral intake and a 4L free water deficit. The patient's sodium levels have improved, and his electrolytes are being trended. 

He also has a dirty urinalysis (UA), and a urine culture will be followed. His current antibiotics should cover urinary pathogens. 

Furthermore, the patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and will have a wound consult today. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to CHF, although probably has component of infection. 
- Pneumonia treatment as below for HAP: vanc and zosyn
- Lasix 40mg IV negative today for goal 1L negative.

2. Pneumonia: Extubated successfully. Treat as HAP as he is coming from an institution.
- Vancomycin/Zosyn for broad coverage
- Sputum, blood cultures
- Consider Flagyl if decompensating for aspiration
- PICC placed for IV abx

3. Hypotension/Shock: unclear etiology, could be either secondary to septic shock from PNA infection vs. cardiogenic shock from CHF. Now improved. Most likely component of sepsis or hypovolemia based on high Na"

","Summary:
The patient is an 78-year-old male with a history of heart disease, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and acute myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia and has been treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 132/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is extubated and doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged bed rest can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.
2. Aspiration pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers. The patient's skin examination is normal, but close monitoring and regular repositioning are necessary to prevent skin breakdown.
4. Acute myocardial infarction increases the risk of heart failure and arrhythmias. The patient has been diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is receiving aspirin (ASA) therapy.
5. Anemia can result from chronic disease or blood loss"
