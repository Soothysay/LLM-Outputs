   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has impaired skin integrity. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure may require prolonged ventilation support, which carries its own set of risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Cardiac complications: Following a myocardial infarction, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or additional myocardial ischemia.

3. Infection: Due to impaired skin integrity, the patient is at an increased risk of developing infections at the site of skin breakdown or through other routes.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs (DVT), which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.

5. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.

It is important for the medical team to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have three-vessel disease on catheterization. The patient's initial presentation was consistent with inferior STEMI, along with old anterior q-waves. The patient is currently intubated and being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and diastolic heart failure, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has restrictive lung disease and is currently intubated. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes, which increases the risk of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, especially if insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications are used.
4. Renal Complications: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and her creatinine levels may increase due to factors such as dehydration, medication use, or acute kidney injury.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the use of antiplatelet medications during catheterization increases the risk of bleeding"

   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-7**], new left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction is identified c/w interim ischemia.
   There appeared to be basal inferior hypokinesis on review of the prior
   study.
   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-[**Date Range 368**] (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Will start Plavix 75mg QD
   - Discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**] re: ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, but inadequate thus
   far, as continues to have large Aa gradient  with O2 sats in the mid to
   high 90s on 50% FiO2.   Requires further diuresis.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Not on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**] as outpatient; can discuss with primary cardiologist
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**]
   - Continue with IV lasix for diuresis, goal > 2 L over 24 hrs, will
   give 40mg IV now and reassess in afternoon.
   - Change Imdur to a Isosorbide Dinitrate TID.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-[**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] titrate up w/ goal of 60-80.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. PFTs
   more consistent with restriction than with COPD, likely due to her body
   habitus.  Currently on PEEP of 10 w/ improved O2 sats.  Will require
   further diuresis aggressively to help w/ weaning off vent.   She is on
   advair and albuterol as an outpatient.
   - Continue with outpatient medications
   - Will decreased PEEP to 8cm this AM and reassess w ABG
   - Wean off vent as allowed by oxygen saturations, Goal > 92%.
   - Keep fentanyl on board to make pt comfortable
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH (1/2 dose) with HISS.
   # HISTORY OF GI BLEED:  Will monitor hcts given anti-platelets given in
   cath
   # CKD:  Creatinine appears to have been below her baseline at the time
   of presentation.  Slightly up from yesterday.
   - Follow daily Cr with expectation that she may increase from her

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have three-vessel disease on catheterization. ECG changes indicated an inferior STEMI and old anterior q-waves. The family has declined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and medical management is being considered for now, with the possibility of stenting in the future.

The patient's assessment includes diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and inadequate diuresis, as evidenced by a large A-a gradient with oxygen saturations in the mid to high 90s on 50% FiO2. Further diuresis is required.

The plan includes continuing carvedilol, not initiating an ACE inhibitor due to the patient's history of a gastrointestinal bleed, and starting Plavix 75mg QD. The patient will also be discussed with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 6782] regarding the possibility of an ACE inhibitor. IV lasix will be given for diuresis, with a goal of >2 L over 24 hours.

Other aspects of the patient's care include rhythm management with beta-blockers and titration up to a goal rate of 60-80 bpm, pulmonary support with intubation and decreased PEEP to 8cm this morning, we"

   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-7**], new left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction is identified c/w interim ischemia.
   There appeared to be basal inferior hypokinesis on review of the prior
   study.
   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-[**Date Range 368**] (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Will start Plavix 75mg QD
   - Discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**] re: ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, but inadequate thus
   far, as continues to have large Aa gradient  with O2 sats in the mid to
   high 90s on 50% FiO2.   Requires further diuresis.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Not on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**] as outpatient; can discuss with primary cardiologist
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**]
   - Continue with IV lasix for diuresis, goal > 2 L over 24 hrs, will
   give 40mg IV now and reassess in afternoon.
   - Change Imdur to a Isosorbide Dinitrate TID.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-[**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] titrate up w/ goal of 60-80.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. PFTs
   more consistent with restriction than with COPD, likely due to her body
   habitus.  Currently on PEEP of 10 w/ improved O2 sats.  Will require
   further diuresis aggressively to help w/ weaning off vent.   She is on
   advair and albuterol as an outpatient.
   - Continue with outpatient medications
   - Will decreased PEEP to 8cm this AM and reassess w ABG
   - Wean off vent as allowed by oxygen saturations, Goal > 92%.
   - Keep fentanyl on board to make pt comfortable
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH (1/2 dose) with HISS.
   # HISTORY OF GI BLEED:  Will monitor hcts given anti-platelets given in
   cath
   # CKD:  Creatinine appears to have been below her baseline at the time
   of presentation.  Slightly up from yesterday.
   - Follow daily Cr with expectation that she may increase from her
   current level
   # IBS:  Hold outpatient regimen while NPO
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  Diuresing with IV lasix; NPO while intubated though may get tube
   feeds should she remain intubated for extended period of time

   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-[**Year (4 digits) 368**] (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Will start Plavix 75mg QD
   - Discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**] re: ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, but inadequate thus
   far, as continues to have large Aa gradient  with O2 sats in the mid to
   high 90s on 50% FiO2.   Requires further diuresis.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Not on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**] as outpatient; can discuss with primary cardiologist
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**]
   - Continue with IV lasix for diuresis, goal > 2 L over 24 hrs, will
   give 40mg IV now and reassess in afternoon.
   - Change Imdur to a Isosorbide Dinitrate TID.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-[**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] titrate up w/ goal of 60-80.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. PFTs
   more consistent with restriction than with COPD, likely due to her body
   habitus.  Currently on PEEP of 10 w/ improved O2 sats.  Will require
   further diuresis aggressively to help w/ weaning off vent.   She is on
   advair and albuterol as an outpatient.
   - Continue with outpatient medications
   - Will decreased PEEP to 8cm this AM and reassess w ABG
   - Wean off vent as allowed by oxygen saturations, Goal > 92%.
   - Keep fentanyl on board to make pt comfortable
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH (1/2 dose) with HISS.
   # HISTORY OF GI BLEED:  Will monitor hcts given anti-platelets given in
   cath
   # CKD:  Creatinine appears to have been below her baseline at the time
   of presentation.  Slightly up from yesterday.
   - Follow daily Cr with expectation that she may increase from her
   current level
   # IBS:  Hold outpatient regimen while NPO
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) on catheterization. The patient underwent medical management and was extubated today.

The patient required restraints due to delirium and was given zyprexa 5 mg po x1. Her diet was advanced from NPO to regular, and her NPH dose was decreased from 22 to 18 units qam. The patient's sugars were trending down overnight, so she was given D5W 0.5 amp x2.

The patient has a history of allergies to Naprosyn (Oral), Metoprolol, Sulfa (Sulfonamides), and Verapamil. She is currently on several medications including pantoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 119/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory system compliance of 41.7 cmH2O/mL, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have triple vessel disease on catheterization. ECG changes were consistent with inferior STEMI, along with old anterior q-waves. The patient has undergone medical management for her condition and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, which can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention. It is important to monitor her fluid balance and adjust diuretic therapy as needed to prevent worsening of heart failure symptoms.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's triple vessel disease increases her risk for future cardiac events, including myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and regular follow-up with a cardiologist are necessary.
3. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's restrictive lung disease, she may be at an increased risk for respiratory infections and worsening respiratory function. Frequent assessment of respiratory status, including oxygen saturation levels and auscultation of lung sounds, is recommended.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating a decline in renal function. It is crucial to monitor renal function closely and adjust medication dosages accordingly to prevent further deterioration.

   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese with Zaroxyln 5mg + 120mg IV Lasix
   - check CXR and PM lytes
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # RENAL DYSFUCTION: Creatinine up to 2.2 today.  Likely secondary to
   contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 3 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  Developing oliguric/aneuric renal
   failure.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) on coronary catheterization. The patient's ECG changes at presentation were consistent with an inferior STEMI, although there were also old anterior q-waves. The family has declined coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and medical management is being pursued for now, with the possibility of considering stenting in the future.

The patient has known diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and initially presented with symptoms consistent with volume overload. She has been diuresed somewhat, but her creatinine levels have increased to 2.2, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with poor urine output. The patient is currently on carvedilol for beta-blocker therapy and has had her Lisinopril dosage stopped due to worsening renal function. She will continue to be diuresed with Zaroxolyn followed by 120 IV Lasix.

The patient also has periods of sinus tachycardia, and her current heart rate is in the 60-90 range. She will continue to receive carvedilol at a dosage of 12.5mg PO BID.

The patient's pulmonary status is worsening, requiring higher oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) on catheterization. The patient reached oliguric renal failure, with urine output less than 100 cc per day. She was given metolazone and lasix, resulting in an improvement in urine output. However, her creatinine levels increased to 2.8, indicating worsening renal function. The patient also has an infection indicated by positive leukocytes and bacteria in the urine. She was restarted on ceftriaxone. Despite diuresis, the patient's pulmonary status worsened, requiring higher oxygen requirements. She was intubated but later extubated. Her blood pressure remains low, and she continues to have crackles bilaterally in the lungs, as well as wheezing. The patient's sodium and potassium levels are imbalanced. Her cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin-T) are elevated, indicating myocardial injury. The patient has a history of allergies to naproxen, metoprolol, and sulfa medications. She is currently on various medications including aspirin, carvedilol, simvastatin, Plavix, levothyroxine, and COPD inhalers. The patient's diabetes is being managed with NPH and HISS. She has hypothyroidism and is on levothyroxine. The patient's renal dysfunction is likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy. She requires close monitoring and management of her electrolyte imbalances, glycemic control, and nutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating declining renal function. This can lead to further electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and accumulation of waste products.
2. Infection: The presence of leukocytes and bacteria in the urine suggests a urinary tract infection. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and systemic infection.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary status is worsening, indicated by crackles and wheezing in the lungs. This can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has a history of CAD and 3VD. There is a risk of ongoing myocardial ischemia or infarction, which can lead to further cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has imbalances in sodium and potassium levels, which can affect cardiac conduction and muscle function. Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and her medical condition. Prophylaxis with he"

   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.0  today.  Likely secondary
   to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not respond to
   metolazone/laxix 120 and metolazone/lasix 160 yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  The patient
   was oliguirc overnight; however her UOP was picking up this am.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will give 5 mg of metolazone
   and start a lasix gtt while closely monitoring her UOP.

   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.

   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to
   amoxicillin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with a STEMI. She underwent catheterization and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-left anterior descending artery. The patient has experienced several complications since admission, including oliguric renal failure, positive urine cultures indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI), worsening pulmonary status requiring intubation and extubation, and hypothyroidism. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 107/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased to 2.8 mg/dL, indicating renal dysfunction. The renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis, but the Doppler study was limited. The patient's oliguria has improved slightly, but she still requires close monitoring and diuresis. Further evaluation by a renal consultant is recommended.
2. Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN): Given the significant dye load during the catheterization procedure, CIN is a likely cause of the acute renal failure. Continued monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She had a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty to the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues.

24-hour events:
1. The patient reached oliguric renal failure, with urine output (UOP) less than 100cc. She was given metolazone and lasix, resulting in an improvement in UOP to less than 50cc over the following 6 hours. The renal team suspects acute kidney injury (AKI) due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN), or embolic phenomenon. The patient's urinalysis (UA) was positive for leukocytes, white blood cells (WBCs), and bacteria, so ceftriaxone was restarted.
2. The patient's creatinine level increased to 2.8 mg/dL, and febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) was suspected. However, the fever resolved, and C. difficile toxin was negative.
3. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or other complaints.

Medical allergies:
1. Naprosyn (Oral) - Nausea/Vomiting
2. Metoprolol - Rash
3. NSAIDs - Rash
4. Sulfa (Sulfonamides) - Unknown
5. Verapamil - Unknown

Infusions:
1. Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) - Started on 11/10/2140 at 04:00 PM
2. Furosemide (Lasix) - Started on 11/10/2140 at 08:46 PM

Other medications:
1. Aspirin
2. Carvedilol
3. Simvastatin
4. Plavix 75mg QD
5. Lisinopril 5mg PO qday (stopped due to worsening renal function)
6. Levothyroxine
7. NPH with HISS (for diabetes)

Review of systems:
The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 38.0 C (100.4 F)
- Heart rate: 68 bpm (range 66-94 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 107/40 mmHg (range 91/33-143/67 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (range 13-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95% on nasal cannula

Physical examination:
- General: Awake and interactive, oriented x 2.
- HEENT: NCAT, sclera anicteric, OP clear"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Reached oliguric renal failure, U/O < 100cc s/p metolazone and lasix
   120 in am. Renal felt that ARF most likely is CIN vs. AIN vs.
   embolic.  Her UA was positive again for leuks/WBCs/bacteria, per renal
   recs restarted CFTX.  No Eos on UA, added on for diff in AM labs.
   Urine lytes were still pending.  Repeated metolazone and Lasix 160 in
   afternoon, w/ U/O < 50cc over following 6hrs.  Cr. bumped to 2.8 w/ PM

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-blocker (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   -stop Lisinopril 5mg PO qday given worsening renal function
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, and creatinine
   increased to 2.2, likely secondary to ATN with poor urine output.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - stop Lisinopril
   - will attempt to diurese with 5 Zaroxyln followed by 120 IV Lasix.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-blocker.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese with Zaroxyln 5mg + 120mg IV Lasix
   - check CXR and PM lytes
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # RENAL DYSFUCTION: Creatinine up to 2.2 today.  Likely secondary to
   contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 3 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  Developing oliguric/aneuric renal
   failure.
   - check urine lytes, spin urine for casts
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - diurese as above
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  cardiac diet, replete lytes as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease.
- She presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) on catheterization.
- The patient has undergone medical management for her coronary artery disease, including aspirin, carvedilol, simvastatin, and Plavix.
- She also has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, which has been managed with diuretics.
- The patient's renal function has worsened, with an increase in creatinine to 2.8, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from contrast-induced nephropathy.
- She is oliguric/anuric and requires aggressive diuresis with metolazone and lasix.
- The patient has experienced episodes of sinus tachycardia and is on beta-blocker therapy.
- She was intubated in the cath lab due to decreasing oxygen saturation and pO2 but has been extubated since then.
- The patient's pulmonary status has worsened, requiring higher oxygen requirements.
- She has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is being managed with home NPH with HISS.

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient continues to have low UOP.  Are attempting another 5 of
   metolazone and lasix gtt tonight to help possible post ATN diuresis as
   her UOP started to pick up a little.  Renal agreed with the lasix.  Her
   UCx grew out enterococcus, so her ceftriaxone was stopped and she was
   started on amoxicillin.  She had a PICC placed.
   The patient continued to have low UOP overnight even with the
   metolazone and lasix gtt and there was concern that she was dry
   overnight, so she was given 250 cc of NS.
   This am she denies CP, SOB, dizziness.  Admits to crampy abdominal
   pain.  No bowel movements or diarrhea yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was found to have a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD). She is currently in the ICU and experiencing acute renal failure, pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 3.0 to 3.5, indicating worsening renal function. This could be secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy due to the significant dye load during the catheterization procedure. Close monitoring of urine output and continued use of lasix drip are recommended. Renal consult is appreciated.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has positive UA and urine cultures growing out enterococcus, suggesting a possible UTI. The change in antibiotics from ceftriaxone to amoxicillin is appropriate. It is important to follow up with enterococcus sensitivities.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic diastolic CHF. Her initial presentation was consistent with overload, likely an acute decompensation. Close"

   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.0  today.  Likely secondary
   to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not respond to
   metolazone/laxix 120 and metolazone/lasix 160 yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  The patient
   was oliguirc overnight; however her UOP was picking up this am.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will give 5 mg of metolazone
   and start a lasix gtt while closely monitoring her UOP.
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - Continue holding her acei.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese as above
   - check CXR
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-LAD. The patient has a total of three vessels involved based on coronary angiography. She is currently experiencing acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level, likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy. Her urine output has been low and not responding to metolazone/lasix treatment. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive urine cultures growing enterococcus. She was previously intubated due to respiratory distress but is now extubated and stable on supplemental oxygen. She has a history of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions.

Potential medical complications:
1. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest the development of acute renal failure, which may be related to the contrast dye used during the coronary angiography. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture growing enterococcus, indicating a UTI. Prompt antibiotic therapy should be initiated to prevent the progression of infection.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous oxygenation balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-left anterior descending artery. 

The patient is currently experiencing acute renal failure with rising creatinine levels, likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient did not respond to metolazone/lasix 80 mg bolus and yesterday. A renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis, and the Doppler study was limited. However, her urine output began to improve this morning, so the lasix drip will be continued while closely monitoring her urine output.

The patient also has coronary artery disease with 3-vessel disease on catheterization. ECG changes at presentation were consistent with inferior STEMI, and there were old anterior q-waves. The family and cardiac surgery team have declined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at this time. Medical management will be continued, including aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin. Plavix 75mg QD will be started, and lisinopril will be held due to worsening renal function.

The patient was intubated in the cath lab due to decreasing oxygen saturation and pO2. She is now extubated after diuresis, and her oxygen saturation is stable in the low 90"

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 4.2 today.  Likely ATN.
   Unclear if this will resolve but trial of RRT may improve creatinine.
   A renal US showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.
   Not responsive to diuretics.  Pt now in oliguric renal failure.
   - Discuss with family regarding dialysis
   - F/U with renal today.  Pt will need line placement and start HD
   ?tomorrow vs. today if family amenable
   - Continue holding her acei
   - Continue to trend creatinine and hope for improvement.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   .
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Sats are stable in the low 90
s on 5L.   CXR
   this am does not show any change.  Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   from CHF, unable to diurese with Lasix.
   - HD as per above for fluid removal
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone, then changed to
   ampicillin.
   - Augmentin X 5 days (day # 1 [**2140-11-13**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an elderly female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease.
- She had a STEMI and underwent catheterization and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-left anterior descending artery.
- The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- She is oliguric and not responsive to diuretics. A renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis, but the Doppler study was limited.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/39 mmHg to 203/168 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula with 5 liters of oxygen.
- Physical examination findings include supple neck with jugular venous distention (JVD) of 8 cm, crackles bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases, and trace lower extremity edema.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient has a history of allergies to Naproxen, Metop"

   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD with ARF.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 4.2 today.  Likely ATN.
   Unclear if this will resolve but trial of RRT may improve creatinine.
   A renal US showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.
   Not responsive to diuretics.  Pt now with increasing UOP (made 1.3 cc
   of urine yesterday).
   - Appreciated renal consult, with f/u recs.
   - Continue calcium acetate, and AlOH
   - Continue holding her acei
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.   No recent
   episodes of CP.
   - Continue aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given ARF
   .
   # PULM:  Patient was intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats
   and pO2. Now extubated many days ago after diuresis.  Sats are stable
   in the low 90
s on 5L.     Likely secondary to pulmonary edema from
   CHF, unable to diurese with Lasix given her ARF.
   - Continue monitoring.
   - Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn
   - As her UOP is picking up, she is unlikely to need HD for fluid
   removal.
   # ANEMIA: The patient had a Hct drop of 29.7 to 26.4 today.  No
   clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Will guaiac her stools.
   - Continue to trend; repeat Hct today.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone, then changed to
   amoxicillin, however this was switched to augmentin as she continued to
   be febrile on amoxicillin.
   - Augmentin X 5 days (day # 1 [**2140-11-13**])
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   # Low back pain: Patient has chronic low back pain.
   - Will change Oxycodone to standing 5 mg q6h and discuss with her
   family possibly adding on oxycontin.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She had a STEMI and underwent percutaneous intervention with balloon angioplasty to the mid-LAD. She is currently experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. The renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis, but the Doppler study was limited. The patient is not responding to diuretics, and her urine output is improving. A renal consult has been requested for further management. 

The patient's coronary arteries are significantly blocked, with 3-vessel disease noted on catheterization. She has an inferior wall STEMI and old anterior Q-waves. The family and cardiac surgery team have decided against coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at this time, opting for medical management instead. The plan is to continue aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin. Lisinopril is being held due to acute renal failure.

The patient was intubated in the cath lab due to decreasing oxygen saturation (sats) and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), but has since been extubated. She remains on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and continues to monitor her sats. Her low sats are likely secondary to pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure (CHF). Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers are provided as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD with ARF.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 4.2 today.  Likely ATN.
   Unclear if this will resolve but trial of RRT may improve creatinine.
   A renal US showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.
   Not responsive to diuretics.  Pt now in oliguric renal failure.
   - Discuss with family regarding dialysis
   - F/U with renal today.  Pt will need line placement and start HD
   ?tomorrow vs. today if family amenable
   - Continue holding her acei
   - Continue to trend creatinine and hope for improvement.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   .
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Sats are stable in the low 90
s on 5L.   CXR
   this am does not show any change.  Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   from CHF, unable to diurese with Lasix.
   - HD as per above for fluid removal
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone, then changed to
   ampicillin.
   - Augmentin X 5 days (day # 1 [**2140-11-13**])

   DISPO: unit for now given renal dysfunction
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who experienced a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) and is currently in acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 92% on nasal cannula. She has a systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border and crackles bilaterally in her lungs. There is also trace lower extremity edema and prior medial scar noted on the right leg with venous stasis changes.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels indicating kidney dysfunction, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium. Other lab results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial injury.

Assessment and plan include acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels up to 4.2 today, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is oliguric (producing little urine) and not responsive to diuretics. Renal replacement therapy (R"

   A renal US showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.
   Not responsive to diuretics.  Pt now with increasing UOP (made 1.3 cc

   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.
   - Continue aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin

   in the low 90
s on 5L.     Likely secondary to pulmonary edema from
   CHF, unable to diurese with Lasix given her ARF.
   - Continue monitoring.
   - Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn
   - As her UOP is picking up, she is unlikely to need HD for fluid
   removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone, then changed to
   amoxicillin, however this was switched to augmentin as she continued to
   be febrile on amoxicillin.
   - Augmentin X 5 days (day # 1 [**2140-11-13**])

   DISPO: unit for now given renal dysfunction
","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous intervention with balloon angioplasty to the mid-LAD. The patient also has acute renal failure with a peak creatinine level of 4.2, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There are no indications for hemodialysis (HD) based on renal parameters. The patient is currently receiving calcium acetate and alcohol (AlOH) for renal management, and her medications are being dosed based on renal function. 

The patient's coronary arteries show triple vessel disease on catheterization, and there are ECG changes consistent with an inferior STEMI. The family has declined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and medical management is being continued for now. The patient is on aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin, and Plavix is being given at a dose of 75 mg daily. Lisinopril is being held due to acute renal failure.

The patient was intubated in the cath lab due to decreasing saturation (sats) and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), but has since been extubated. Oxygen saturation is stable in the low 90s on 5 liters of oxygen. This is likely secondary to pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure (CHF), and diuresis with Lasix is not feasible due to acute renal failure. Monitoring will continue, and albuterol and atrovent nebs will be used as needed.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive urine analysis (UA) and cultures growing enterococcus. She has been started on augmentin, which will be continued for five days starting from [**2140-11-13**].

The patient is in normal sinus rhythm, and cardiac rhythm will be monitored via telemetry. Diabetes management will involve continuing home NPH with HISS and monitoring blood sugars. Hypothyroidism will be managed with levothyroxine. The patient's chronic low back pain will be managed with oxycodone as needed.

The patient's diet will consist of a cardiac renal diet, and electrolytes will be repleted as needed. Long-term intravenous access will be provided through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Prophylaxis measures include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a bowel regimen. The patient's code status is full code, and this has been discussed with the family. The patient will remain in the ICU for now due to renal dysfunction."

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who experienced a STEMI and underwent percutaneous oxygenation balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications.

24-hour events:
- Off Lasix due to no indication for hemodialysis (HD). Urine osmolarity (Uosm) is consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Patient's serum creatinine improved to 3.7, and urine output (U/O) is improving.
- Holding diuretics.
- Continuing with AlOH per renal, who will help decide when to discontinue or switch to an alternate therapy.
- Changed Amoxicillin to Augmentin as the patient was still febrile during the day. If the fever continues, may need to change to ampicillin.
- Complement levels pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, indicating acute renal failure. This is likely due to ATN. It is unclear if this condition will resolve, but a trial of renal replacement therapy (RRT) may improve creatinine. The patient has no hydronephrosis based on the renal ultrasound, but the Doppler study was limited. She is not responsive to diuretics,"
