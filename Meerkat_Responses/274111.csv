   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 year old man with type II diabetes who presents with a two
   day history of scrotal pain, edema, and erythema.
   SCROTAL SWELLING
   CT scan appears to show no gas and therefore low likelihood of
   [**Last Name (un) 10634**]
s gangrene; however, extremely high white count given
   localized infection is concerning for aggressive organisms or spreading
   plane of infection. He does not have suprapubic or lower abdominal
   pain, providing hope that an infection is not tracking beyond the
   scrotum. The desquamation present appears consistent with effects of
   acute edematous enlarged scrotum, in which skin stretched desquamates
   its epithelial layer. However, given that he comes with fever, and
   tachycardia, the story would not be inconsistent with [**Last Name (un) 10634**]
s; or,
   more likely, a more superficial cellulitis. With diabetes, concern for
   pseudomonas; or, in perineal/scrotal infection, concern for [**Last Name (un) 10634**]
   or more localized mixed infection with anaerobes. No clear risk for
   MRSA infection, but consequences of MRSA could be dire.
   - for now, covering with zosyn (gram-negative including pseudomonal
   coverage) and vancomycin (for gram-positive and MRSA coverage);
   - follow up blood cultures from our ED, hopefully at OSH as well
   - hope to de-escalate antibiotic coverage in favor of more targeted
   therapy
   - pain control with tylenol, oxycodone prn
   - scrotal sling for comfort
   - urology is co-managing
   - consulted dermatology and plastic surgery per urology request
will
   f/u consults
   .
   TACHYCARDIA
   In setting of high-normal blood pressure, most concerning for
   inadequately treated pain, although patient denies this. Alternatively,
   could be early stage of systemic inflammation.
   - give more aggressive fluid boluses as patient still appears volume
   down
   - will urge patient to take aggressive prn pain medication as brief
   trial
   .
   DIABETES TYPE II
   On metformin and glargine at home. High sugars in last two days
   consistent with infection, would expect control to improve with
   antibiosis.
   - 38 glargine pm, 5 glargine am, as per home regimen
   - ISS
   - discontinue metformin pending possible need for further imaging

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient  and reviewed his history and was
   present for the key portions of the services provided.  I have also
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10627**]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of care.
   I have also spoken with plastic surgery consultant.  The patient has
   scrotal cellulitis for which he
s on Zosyn and Vanco, with stable
   symtoms, improving WBC, and stable hemodymics.  Plastics feels that
   part of pt
s scrotal skin is necrotic and suggests definitive surgical
   Rx by urology and have discussed surgical options with them.  The plan
   is to transfer the patient to urology floor when bed available, with
   urology to decide on the exact scrotal Rx and timing of such Rx.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with type II diabetes.
- He presents with a two-day history of scrotal pain, edema, and erythema.
- The patient has been started on antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) for a possible scrotal infection, which may be caused by aggressive organisms or a spreading infection.
- The patient's fever and tachycardia suggest a systemic response to the infection.
- There is no evidence of gas seen on the CT scan, reducing the likelihood of Fournier's gangrene.
- The patient's high white blood cell count is concerning for a localized infection.
- The patient's diabetes increases the concern for pseudocodes infection.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been high in the last two days.
- The patient is experiencing pain, which is currently being managed with pain medication.
- The patient has been given a scrotal sling for comfort.
- Urology is co-managing the patient's case.
- Consultations have been made with dermatology and plastic surgery.
- The patient's tachycardia may be due to inadequately treated pain or early systemic inflammation.
- The patient appears volume depleted, so aggressive fluid boluses are recommended.
- The patient's diabetes type II is being managed with metformin and glargine.
- The patient's pain is also due to neuropathy.
- Nutrition and glycemic control are"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 year old man with type II diabetes who presents with a two
   day history of scrotal pain, edema, and erythema.
   SCROTAL SWELLING
   CT scan appears to show no gas and therefore low likelihood of
   [**Last Name (un) 10634**]
s gangrene; however, extremely high white count given
   localized infection is concerning for aggressive organisms or spreading
   plane of infection. He does not have suprapubic or lower abdominal
   pain, providing hope that an infection is not tracking beyond the
   scrotum. The desquamation present appears consistent with effects of
   acute edematous enlarged scrotum, in which skin stretched desquamates
   its epithelial layer. However, given that he comes with fever, and
   tachycardia, the story would not be inconsistent with [**Last Name (un) 10634**]
s; or,
   more likely, a more superficial cellulitis. With diabetes, concern for
   pseudomonas; or, in perineal/scrotal infection, concern for [**Last Name (un) 10634**]
   or more localized mixed infection with anaerobes. No clear risk for
   MRSA infection, but consequences of MRSA could be dire.
   - for now, covering with zosyn (gram-negative including pseudomonal
   coverage), flagyl (for anaerobic coverage), and vancomycin (for
   gram-positive and MRSA coverage);
   - abx approval needed in the AM
   - follow up blood cultures from our ED, hopefully at OSH as well
   - hope to rapidly de-escalate antibiotic breadth in favor of more
   targetted therapy
   - pain control with tylenol, morphine prn
   - scrotal sling for comfort
   - urology is co-managing
   - consulted dermatology per urology attending request
they will come in
   AM
   .
   TACHYCARDIA
   In setting of high-normal blood pressure, most concerning for
   inadequately treated pain, although patient denies this. Alternatively,
   could be early stage of systemic inflammation.
   - giving fluid boluses as trial
   - will urge patient to take aggressive prn pain medication as brief
   trial
   - if continues, pt may benefit from echocardiogram; concern would be
   poor stroke volume which might be optimized w understanding of etiology
   .
   DIABETES TYPE II
   On metformin and glargine at home. High sugars in last two days
   consistent with infection, would expect control to improve with
   antibiosis.
   - 38 glargine pm, 5 glargine am, as per home regimen
   - ISS
   - continue metformin
   PAIN CONTROL
   Neuropathy; scrotal pain.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with type II diabetes presenting with a two-day history of scrotal pain, edema, and erythema. He has a fever and tachycardia, which raises concern for a possible infection. The CT scan shows no evidence of gas, indicating a low likelihood of gas gangrene. However, the extremely high white blood cell count suggests the presence of an aggressive infection or a spreading infection. There are no signs of suprapubic or lower abdominal pain, suggesting that the infection may be confined to the scrotum. The patient has been started on antibiotics to cover gram-negative, including pseudomonal coverage, anaerobic coverage, and gram-positive and MRSA coverage. The patient is also receiving pain management and will be followed up with blood cultures. The plan is to rapidly de-escalate antibiotic therapy once the organism is identified. The patient's diabetes type II is being managed with metformin and glargine, and his high blood sugar levels are expected to improve with antibiosis. The patient's tachycardia may be due to inadequately treated pain or early systemic inflammation, and fluid boluses are being given as a trial. An echocardiogram will be considered if the tachycardia continues, to evaluate for poor stroke volume. The patient has neuropathy and is experiencing scrotal pain, for which gabapentin has been prescribed. The patient is currently receiving ICU"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with type II diabetes who presents with a two-day history of scrotal pain, edema, and erythema. The patient was taken to the operating room for debridement of dead scrotal tissue by Urology. The white blood cell count is stable, indicating a localized infection that is concerning for aggressive organisms or spreading infection. The patient appears to have superficial cellulitis with a risk of spreading if not controlled. There is concern for pseudomonas or more localized mixed infection with anaerobes, especially considering the patient's diabetes.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with type II diabetes who presents with a two-day history of scrotal pain, edema, and erythema. He underwent debridement of dead scrotal tissue by urology. The white blood cell count is stable, indicating localized infection with concern for aggressive organisms or spreading infection. The patient appears to have superficial cellulitis with a risk of spreading if not controlled. There is also concern for pseudomonas or more localized mixed infection with anaerobes, especially given his diabetes. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/80 mmHg to 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, vancomycin, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, platelet count of 282 K/uL, blood glucose level of 157 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL.

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital course and
   was present for the key portions of the services provided. I have
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10501**]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of care.
   The patient has had excision of non viable scrotal skin by urology and
   is back in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] comfortable, in minimal pain, without chest pain or
   dyspnea, and has normal oxygenation on room air and has been given 3L
   of fluid IV for tachycardia in the eventuality it might be due to
   volume depletion.  Yet his tachycardia continues unabated at HR of
   135.  He
s not hyperglycemic but is producing lots of dilute urine.
   The etiology of his tachycardia, given all of the above, is not clear.
   We will likely try him on low dose beta blocker to see his HR response
   and also consider assessing his thyroid function and echocardiographic
   cardiac function.  Right now it
s his unexplained tachycardia which is
   keeping him the MICU.

","The patient is a 51-year-old man with type II diabetes who presents with a two-day history of scrotal pain, edema, and erythema. He has been diagnosed with scrotal cellulitis and taken to the operating room for debridement of dead scrotal tissue by urology. The culture grew out group B streptococcus (GBS). The patient is currently being covered with Zosyn and vancomycin until sensitivities come back. He will go to the operating room again today for further debridement, pending CT pelv. Follow-up blood cultures from the emergency department are planned.

Additionally, the patient experienced an atrial tachycardia with bigeminy. Carotid massage helped break the fast rate, and the patient has been in the 80s since then. He is asymptomatic. It is recommended for the patient to follow up with his primary care physician (PCP) for a possible outpatient holter.

The patient also has type II diabetes, for which he is on metformin and glargine at home. Metformin is being held in the hospital, and he is given a dose of insulin as he is NPO. He is also on ISS (insulin sensitivity syndrome) and holding metformin. 

The patient's pain control involves neuropathy and scrotal pain, for which he is prescribed gabapentin and tylenol, morphine.

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10686**]
s note and agree
   with her findings and plan of care. I have also discussed the patient
   case with urology service.  Overall Mr [**Known lastname 10632**] remains stable, and is
   still in NSR following last evening
s carotid sinus massage for what we
   now recognize as an atrial tachycardia.  From the standpoint of his
   scrotal
cellulitis
, he went to the OR today and had drainage of a
   pocket of pus, indicating that this was not just superficial
   cellulitis. This area will be flushed with H202 per urology orders. The
   patient is hemodynamically stable, sugars are fine, and we
ll talk to
   ID about what antibiotic coverage they might advise for Grp B strep
   scrotal infection.  He is well enough to go to the floor tomorrow AM,
   and tonight if bed is emergently needed.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with type II diabetes who presented with a two-day history of scrotal pain, edema, and erythema. He underwent debridement of dead scrotal tissue in the operating room and was found to have superficial cellulitis with the growth of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in cultures. The patient is currently being treated with Zosyn (a gram-negative antibiotic) and vancomycin (for gram-positive and MRSA coverage), with plans to continue this regimen until sensitivity results are available. The patient will also undergo further debridement in the operating room today.

The patient has a history of atrial tachycardia with bigeminy, which was managed with carotid massage and resulted in a decrease in heart rate. It is recommended for the patient to follow up with their primary care physician (PCP) for a possible outpatient holder monitor.

The patient has type II diabetes and is currently receiving insulin as they are NPO (nothing by mouth). They are also on glargine and metformin at home, with metformin being held while in the hospital.

The patient's pain control includes the use of gabapentin, tylenol, and morphine.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is currently NPO after midnight for surgery today. Glycemic control is being managed with HISS plus glargine. The patient has"

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 51 yo M with DM2 who presented with scrotal
   cellulitis now s/p several OR debridement and drainage procedures. Pt
   was taken back to the OR again yesterday with additional pus collection
   drained.  He remains AF. Now with diarrhea X 2 episodes. No further
   episodes of atrial tachycardia and remains in NSR.
   On exam: AF HR 80  BP137/70  94% RA He is alert and appropriate. Lungs
   with scant basilar rales. RR Abd NT soft +BS.  Scrotal area with 3
   drains in position. Scant serosang drainage with minimal purulence at
   all drain sites, mild induration, NT.
   Labs reviewed: WBC 13.4K, HCT 34, cr 0.7 glu 220
   Micro: GBS and GPC/GPR from scrotal tissue cx
   Agree with plan to continue current broad antibx (zosyn and vanco, day
   3) for scrotal cellulitis and deep tissue infection. Can likely d/c
   vanco once GBS sensitivities are back. Would consult ID for additional
   recs regarding length of antibx course. We continue to co-manage along
   with the urology team.  Hemodynamics remain stable and he remains AF,
   though his wbc is up slightly and his blood sugar remains elevated.
   Will send differential off cbc and monitor closely.  Given diarrhea,
   will check c diff cx.  Will increase his am glargine dosing for
   improved BS control. Pt denies pain, will use Tylenol/oxycodone as
   needed.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note. ICU prophy with sq hep.
   Patient is stable to transfer to floor to urology service.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with type II diabetes who presented with scrotal pain, edema, and erythema. He underwent two surgeries for debridement of dead scrotal tissue due to scrotal cellulitis. The culture grew out GBS, and pus was drained from the posterior scrotal area during the last operation. 

The patient's current medical conditions include scrotal cellulitis, atrial tachycardia, type II diabetes, and potential complications related to his ICU stay such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of scrotal cellulitis leading to necrosis, worsening of diabetes control due to ICU stress and medication changes, development of DVT, stress ulcer bleeding, and VAP. 

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing with antibiotics (zosyn and vancomycin) until sensitivities come back for GBS, follow-up blood cultures, pain control with Tylenol and oxycodone as needed, follow-up with primary care physician (PCP) for possible outpatient holter for atrial tachycardia, and managing diabetes while in the hospital."
