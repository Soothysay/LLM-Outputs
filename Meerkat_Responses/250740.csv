   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 M w/ pmh of CRI, HTN, bladder cancer, DVT w/ IVC filter
   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Possible causes include subdural hematoma,
   seizure/post-ictal effect or benzodiazepine effect.  Subdural hematoma
   most likely. Intubated for airway protection.  Likely neurosurgical
   intervention in the next 36 hours.
   - continue ETT w/ CPAP
   - Await EEG read, continue dilantin
   - Appreciate neurosurg and neuro recs
   - Minimize sedating medication
   - Treat underlying cause: Seizures, Subdural
   - Repeat head CT
   # Hypotension: Resolved with fluid administration.  No indication of
   sepsis.  HCT stable overnight s/p 2 U PRBC.
   - call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] (his cardiologist) for more info)
   - Ceftriaxone for UTI
   - Add Vanc level
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts w/ goal hct 25
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  Seems to be having R-sided eye and hand
   twitching that responds to ativan.  Corrected dilantin level elevated.
   - continue dilantin w/ ativan prn
   - EEG
   - appreciate neuro input
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          repeat head CT
   -          Hold heparin gtt
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT w/ IVC filter. Developed SDH in the setting of
   heparin ggt.
   -          hold heparin gtt for now
   -          Pneumoboots
   # Anemia: Hct 21 this am.  Now only 26 after 2 U PRBC.  Could be some
   degree of hemodilution as received approx 2 L NS in the setting of
   hypotension.  Possibly due to hematuria.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] (transfuse for hct < 25)
   - guiac stools
   - Flush Foley for clots/UOP
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Unclear baseline cr.  No need for
   urgent dialysis today.  Hematuria noted with clots flushing
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Bladder scan
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Drop from 140 to 88 overnight. DDx includes HIT,
   DIC, consumption in DVT/hematuria/Subdural organization.
   -          Fibrinogen, Haptoglobin, LDH, smear
   -          PM Platelet count- transfuse per neurosurgical guidelines
   # FEN: IVF boluses for CVP < 12, replete electrolytes cautiously, will
   start TF
   # Prophylaxis: R Pneumoboot
   # Access: R IJ dialysis cath placed at OSH, L IJ placed here on [**1-5**], R
   art line placed at OSH on [**1-5**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, bladder cancer, and deep vein thrombosis with an inferior vena cava filter. He was transferred from another hospital with subdural hematoma, seizures, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and likely requires neurosurgical intervention within the next 36 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to subdural hematoma, seizure, or benzodiazepine effect. Immediate neurosurgical intervention is required.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved with fluid administration. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, and ongoing management is required.
3. Seizures: The patient is experiencing seizures likely caused by the subdural hematoma. Continuous monitoring and administration of antiepileptic drugs are necessary.
4. Large Subdural Hematoma: The patient has a large subdural hematoma, which is unlikely to be the cause of his altered mental status according to neurosurgical assessment. Repeated head CT scans are recommended.
5. DVT: The patient has a history of prior DVT and an IVC filter. He developed a subdural hematoma while on heparin therapy. Heparin therapy should be held,"

- Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, abnormal liver function tests, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- The patient has a subdural hemorrhage, seizure, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and other conditions.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (dialysis catheter, arterial line, and multi-lumen), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), and VAP precautions.
- The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to being intubated and receiving multiple antibiotics.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of hematuria and clots irrigated, which indicates a potential risk for bleeding complications.
3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has abnormal lab results indicating possible electrolyte and fluid imbalances.
4. Seizure recurrence: Despite the EEG showing no seizure activity, the patient witnessed event could potentially indicate a risk for future seizure episodes.
5. Organ dysfunction: The abnormal liver and kidney function tests suggest potential organ dysfunction, which may require further investigation and management.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility and leg swelling put them at risk for developing DVT and subsequent PE.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and bites down on ETT indicate a potential risk for developing pressure ulcers.
8. Contractures: The patient's immobility and edema in the extremities may increase the risk of contractures.
9. Poor wound healing: The presence of eschar on the right great toe could impair wound healing and increase the risk of infection."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, bladder cancer, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to subdural hematoma, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which could be caused by subdural hematoma, seizure, or benzodiazepine effect. Further evaluation, such as EEG and neurosurgical consultation, is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was resolved with fluid administration. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management are necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability.
3. Seizures: The patient had seizures likely due to the subdural hematoma. Continuous monitoring for seizure activity and administration of antiepileptic drugs like dilantin and lorazepam are recommended.
4. Large subdural hematoma: The patient has a large subdural hematoma, but neurosurgical consultation suggests that it is not the cause of altered mental status. Close observation and further evaluation may be required.
5. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and currently"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 M w/ pmh of CRI, HTN, bladder cancer, DVT w/ IVC filter
   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Possible causes include subdural hematoma,
   seizure/post-ictal effect or benzodiazepine effect.  Subdural hematoma
   most likely. Intubated for airway protection.  Likely neurosurgical
   intervention in the next 36 hours.
   - continue ETT w/ CPAP
   - Await EEG read, continue dilantin
   - Appreciate neurosurg and neuro recs
   - Minimize sedating medication
   - Treat underlying cause: Seizures, Subdural
   - Repeat head CT
   # Hypotension: Resolved with fluid administration.  No indication of
   sepsis.  HCT stable overnight s/p 2 U PRBC.
   - call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] (his cardiologist) for more info)
   - Ceftriaxone for UTI
   - Add Vanc level
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts w/ goal hct 25
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  Seems to be having R-sided eye and hand
   twitching that responds to ativan.  Corrected dilantin level elevated.
   - continue dilantin w/ ativan prn
   - EEG
   - appreciate neuro input
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          repeat head CT
   -          Hold heparin gtt
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT w/ IVC filter. Developed SDH in the setting of
   heparin ggt.
   -          hold heparin gtt for now
   -          Pneumoboots
   # Anemia: Hct 21 this am.  Now only 26 after 2 U PRBC.  Could be some
   degree of hemodilution as received approx 2 L NS in the setting of
   hypotension.  Possibly due to hematuria.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] (transfuse for hct < 25)
   - guiac stools
   - Flush Foley for clots/UOP
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Unclear baseline cr.  No need for
   urgent dialysis today.  Hematuria noted with clots flushing
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Bladder scan
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Drop from 140 to 88 overnight. DDx includes HIT,
   DIC, consumption in DVT/hematuria/Subdural organization.
   -          Fibrinogen, Haptoglobin, LDH, smear
   -          PM Platelet count- transfuse per neurosurgical guidelines
   # FEN: IVF boluses for CVP < 12, replete electrolytes cautiously, will
   start TF
   # Prophylaxis: R Pneumoboot
   # Access: R IJ dialysis cath placed at OSH, L IJ placed here on [**1-5**], R
   art line placed at OSH on [**1-5**]
   # Code: Was DNR/DNI but now full code.  If underlying cause of AMS is
   not reversible, son would want him to be [**Name (NI) 580**].
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 5323**] (son) Cell:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5324**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, bladder cancer, and deep vein thrombosis with an inferior vena cava filter. The patient was transferred from another hospital with subdural hematoma, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension. 

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status, which is likely caused by a subdural hematoma. The patient's condition requires neurosurgical intervention within the next 36 hours. 

The patient's hypotension has resolved with fluid administration and there is no indication of sepsis. However, the patient's hematocrit (HCT) dropped from 27.1 to 25.4 after receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). 

The patient experienced seizures likely related to the subdural hematoma. 

The patient has a large subdural hematoma but neurosurgery does not consider it the cause of altered mental status. 

The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and developed subdural hematoma while receiving heparin. 

The patient's anemia is being treated with blood transfusions for HCT < 25. 

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with an unclear baseline creatinine level. 

The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 M w/ pmh of CRI, HTN, bladder cancer, DVT w/ IVC filter
   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Possible causes include subdural hematoma,
   seizure/post-ictal effect or benzodiazepine effect.  Subdural hematoma
   most likely. Intubated for airway protection.  Likely neurosurgical
   intervention in the next 36 hours, if family still wants all measures.
   Repeat Head CT with minimal change [**1-7**].
   - continue ETT w/ CPAP
   - F/u EEG read, continue dilantin
   - Appreciate neurosurg and neuro recs-plan for family mtg today to
   discuss benefits of neurosurgery and weigh consequences
   - Minimize sedating medication
   - Treat underlying cause: Seizures, Subdural
   # Right toe eschar-unable to palpate or Doppler pulses and concern is
   for arterial insufficiency.  Not anticoagulation candidate
   - Vascular consulted
   # Hypotension: Resolved with fluid administration.  No indication of
   sepsis.  HCT stable overnight s/p 2 U PRBC yesterday
   - call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] (his cardiologist) for more info)
   - Ceftriaxone for UTI
   - Add Vanc level
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts w/ goal hct 25
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  Seems to be having R-sided eye and hand
   twitching that responds to ativan.  Corrected dilantin level elevated.
   - continue dilantin w/ ativan prn
   - EEG
   - appreciate neuro input
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          repeat head CT
   -          Hold heparin gtt
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT w/ IVC filter. Developed SDH in the setting of
   heparin ggt.
   -          hold heparin gtt for now
   -          Pneumoboots
   # Anemia: Hct 25.4 in setting of hemodilution and hematuria
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT (transfuse for hct < 25)
   - guiac stools
   - Flush Foley for clots/UOP
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Unclear baseline cr.  No need for
   urgent dialysis today.  Creatinine steadily rising.
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Renal US
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Drop from 140 to 88 overnight. DDx includes HIT,
   DIC, consumption in DVT/hematuria/Subdural organization.  Hemolysis

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with subdural hematomas, hypotension, and seizure activity. The patient has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin, and ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 105/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 529 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin examination were not assessed. Neurologic examination revealed the patient responding to verbal commands, with movement, tone, and sensation not assessed. The patient has a history of allergies to NSAIDs and sulfonamides. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and liver enzymes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin, and ceftriaxone) for suspected subdural empyema. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of subdural hemorrhage (SDH), seizure, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and other medical conditions. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's 24-hour events include scrotal swelling and a leaky catheter, which led to the replacement of the Foley catheter by urology. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was also placed as none was seen on X-ray. The patient underwent a CT scan to evaluate for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). There was a family meeting regarding the possibility of neurosurgery, but it was decided against for now. Vascular studies, including nitro to toes and an ultrasound to evaluate arterial and venous circulation, were performed. Renal ultrasound was also conducted to investigate the cause of renal failure. An EEG showed a 10-second left frontal seizure consistent with subdural hemorrhage, and the patient is currently on therapeutic dilantin. Large right pleural bleed, source unknown, was observed, and vascular was notified. However, it was recommended to check the hemoglobin level repeatedly. Pressures dropped to the 80s after nitropaste and oxycodone for pain. The nitropaste was wiped off, and a hemoglobin level of 26.5 was found to be stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of subdural hemorrhage, seizure activity, hypotension, and renal failure. The patient's recent events include scrotal swelling and a leaky catheter, placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, a CT scan to evaluate for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), nitrotoes, and an ultrasound to assess arterial and venous issues. The patient also underwent a trans-thoracic echo, arterial cuff study, and various lab tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subdural Hemorrhage: The patient's history of subdural hemorrhage increases the risk of recurrent bleeding in the brain, potentially leading to further neurological complications.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient's seizure activity indicates ongoing neurological issues. Recurrent seizures can lead to status epilepticus, which may require emergency intervention.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension puts him at risk for organ hypoperfusion and failure. This could be due to underlying cardiac, renal, or circulatory problems.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is indicated by elevated creatinine levels and urine output. If left untreated, renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infections.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 M w/ pmh of CRI, HTN, bladder cancer, DVT w/ IVC filter
   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Possible causes include subdural hematoma,
   seizure/post-ictal effect or benzodiazepine effect.  Subdural hematoma
   most likely. Intubated for airway protection.  Likely neurosurgical
   intervention in the next 36 hours, if family still wants all measures.
   Repeat Head CT with minimal change [**1-7**].
   - continue ETT w/ CPAP
   - F/u EEG read, continue dilantin
   - Appreciate neurosurg and neuro recs-plan for family mtg today to
   discuss benefits of neurosurgery and weigh consequences
   - Minimize sedating medication
   - Treat underlying cause: Seizures, Subdural
   # Right toe eschar-unable to palpate or Doppler pulses and concern is
   for arterial insufficiency.  Not anticoagulation candidate
   - Vascular consulted
   # Hypotension: Resolved with fluid administration.  No indication of
   sepsis.  HCT stable overnight s/p 2 U PRBC yesterday
   - call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] (his cardiologist) for more info)
   - Ceftriaxone for UTI
   - Add Vanc level
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts w/ goal hct 25
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  Seems to be having R-sided eye and hand
   twitching that responds to ativan.  Corrected dilantin level elevated.
   - continue dilantin w/ ativan prn
   - EEG
   - appreciate neuro input

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, bladder cancer, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. He was transferred from another hospital with a subdural hematoma (SDH), seizures, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, right toe eschar with concern for arterial insufficiency, hypotension resolved with fluid administration, seizures likely due to SDH, large subdural hematoma, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 88, acute on chronic renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, which can be caused by subdural hematoma, seizure, or benzodiazepine effect. The most likely cause appears to be subdural hematoma. Intubation is necessary for airway protection, and neurosurgical intervention is likely needed within the next 36 hours.
2. Right toe eschar: The patient has a right toe eschar with concerns about arterial insufficiency. There is a possibility of limb ischemia, and vascular consultation has been requested.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension that resolved with"

   - continue dilantin w/ ativan prn
   - Discuss adding Keppra with Neuro as Sz may be very subtle
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          repeat head CT

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, bladder cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and hypotension. The patient was transferred from another hospital with subdural hematoma (SDH), seizures, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has altered mental status, right toe eschar with concern for arterial insufficiency, hypotension, seizures, large subdural hematoma, anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures likely due to the subdural hematoma. Continued monitoring and management of seizures are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension needs to be managed with appropriate fluid administration and vasopressor support as needed.
3. Large Subdural Hematoma: Although the neurosurgeon does not believe this is the cause of altered mental status, repeated head CT scans should be done to monitor the size and effect on the patient's condition.
4. Right Toe Eschar: The presence of eschar on the right great toe raises concerns for arterial insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent and"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: The patient has cool feet bilaterally and eschar on the right great toe. There is also mention of bilateral lower extremity swelling with edema and absent pedal pulses. These findings suggest compromised blood flow to the lower extremities, which can lead to tissue necrosis and potential amputation.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has a low sodium level (Na+: 106 mEq/L) and a low potassium level (K+: 3.4 mg/dL). These imbalances can affect various bodily functions and may require careful monitoring and correction.

3. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient has a large subdural hematoma, which is a collection of blood between the covering of the brain (dura) and the surface of the brain. This condition can cause altered mental status and seizures. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to determine the appropriate management, such as repeat head CT scans and consultation with a neurosurgeon.

4. Seizure: The patient is experiencing seizures, as indicated by the EEG showing frontal seizures consistent with an SDH. Managing seizures is crucial to prevent further neurological complications and improve the patient's overall condition.

5. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, requiring fluid administration."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, bladder cancer, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. He was transferred from another hospital with subdural hematoma, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection, and there are concerns about arterial insufficiency in his right toe due to an eschar and possible peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He has altered mental status, likely due to subdural hematoma, and has experienced seizures. His laboratory results show anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, vasopressors, and dialysis catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subdural Hematoma: The patient has a large subdural hematoma, which can cause altered mental status and seizures. Close monitoring of neurological status and repeat head CT scans are recommended.
2. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with Critical Limb Ischemia: The patient's right toe has an eschar and cool feet, indicating possible arterial insufficiency. Vascular consultation and further evaluation with imaging studies, such as a Doppler ultrasound or angiography, are necessary to assess"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 M w/ pmh of CRI, HTN, bladder cancer, DVT w/ IVC filter
   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Possible causes include subdural hematoma,
   seizure/post-ictal effect or benzodiazepine effect.  Subdural hematoma
   most likely. Intubated for airway protection.  No neurosurgical
   intervention after family meeting.  Repeat Head CT with minimal change
   [**1-9**].  EEG with frontal sz consistent with SDH
   - continue ETT w/ CPAP-change to 5/5 to see if patient tolerates today,
   plan to extubate in afternoon after attempting diuresis
   - Continue Dilantin, discuss with neuro about adding keppra or other
   second [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Minimize sedating medication and ativan
   - F/U NS and Neuro recs.
   # Right toe eschar-unable to palpate or Doppler pulses and concern is
   for arterial insufficiency.  Not anticoagulation candidate Prelim
   report on US showed SFA occlusion with reconstitution distal to
   popliteal
   -          Vascular consulted-follow recs
   -          F/U on final report of US
   -          F/U final read on CT-prelim reads + for AAA in throracic and
   infra renal, which are known from previous records
   -          Conitinue
 inch nitropaste to toes as needed
   # Hypotension: Resolved with fluid administration.  No indication of
   sepsis.  HCT stable overnight s/p 2 U PRBC on first night of transfer
   - d/c Ceftriaxone/Vanc and start Unasyn for total of 7 days on Day 5 of
   Abx today.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts w/ goal hct 25
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   - if spikes consider adding vanc/zosyn back
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  Seems to be having R-sided eye and hand
   twitching that responds to ativan.  Corrected dilantin level elevated.
   - continue dilantin consider adding second [**Doctor Last Name **] if continues to have
   seizure activity
   - Discuss adding Keppra with Neuro as Sz may be very subtle
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          repeat head CT
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT. Developed SDH in the setting of heparin ggt.  DVT
   not seen on KUB yesterday, underwent IVC filter placement on [**1-8**]
   -          Pneumoboots
   -          Discuss with neursurg adding heparin SQ
   # Anemia: Hct 25.4 in setting of hemodilution and hematuria-no further
   hematuria overnight after foley replaced by urology
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT (transfuse for hct < 25)
   - guiac stools
   - Flush Foley for clots/UOP, consult urology if does not improve
   - Consider EPO with HD
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Unclear baseline cr.  No need for
   urgent dialysis today.  Creatinine steadily rising.
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Renal US-f/u on read
   -          HD for today
   -          Holding nephrocaps because cannot be crushed, switch calcium
   acetate to carbonate for ease of crushing
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Drop from 140 to 88 overnight. DDx includes HIT,
   DIC, consumption in DVT/hematuria/Subdural organization.  Hemolysis
   workup negative
   -          FPM Platelet count- transfuse per neurosurgical guidelines
   # FEN: IVF boluses for hypotension, replete electrolytes cautiously,
   will start TF
   # Prophylaxis: R Pneumoboot, discuss heparin SQ with NS
   # Access: R IJ dialysis cath placed at OSH, L IJ placed here on [**1-5**], R

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-inch tall and 69.5 kg male with a chief complaint of 24-hour events. The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, subdural hemorrhage, seizure, hypotension, and is currently in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with Critical Limb Ischemia: This refers to poor blood circulation in the peripheral vessels, leading to inadequate blood flow to the limbs, particularly the lower extremities. It can result in pain, non-healing wounds, and potential tissue death if left untreated.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's lab results indicate imbalances in sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and phosphate (PO4) levels. These imbalances can affect various bodily functions and must be corrected promptly to prevent complications.
3. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): This refers to bleeding that occurs between the dura mater and the brain tissue. It can be caused by trauma or increased intracranial pressure. Symptoms may include headache, confusion, changes in consciousness, and seizures. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further bleeding or neurological deterioration.
4. Seizure: The patient has experienced seizures, which can be a result of the subdural hemorrhage or other underlying conditions. Seizures can pose a risk of injury"

         2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   BUDDING YEAST WITH PSEUDOHYPHAE.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 M w/ pmh of CRI, HTN, bladder cancer, DVT w/ IVC filter
   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Improving, difficult to gauge current status.
   No neurosurgical intervention after family meeting.  EEG with frontal
   sz consistent with SDH.
   - Continue Dilantin, discuss with neuro about adding keppra or other
   second [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Minimize sedating medication and ativan
   - F/U NS and Neuro recs.
   # Right toe eschar-unable to palpate, + Doppler pulses and concern is
   for arterial insufficiency.  Not anticoagulation candidate Prelim
   report on US showed SFA occlusion with reconstitution distal to
   popliteal
   -          Vascular consulted-follow recs
   -          F/U on final report of US
   -          F/U final read on CT-prelim reads + for AAA in throracic and
   infra renal, which are known from previous records
   -          Conitinue
 inch nitropaste to toes as needed
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  Seems to be having R-sided eye and hand
   twitching that responds to ativan.  Corrected dilantin level elevated.
   - continue dilantin consider adding second [**Doctor Last Name **] if continues to have
   seizure activity
   - Discuss adding Keppra with Neuro as Sz may be very subtle
   # Hypotension: Resolved with fluid administration.  No indication of
   sepsis.  HCT stable overnight s/p 2 U PRBC on first night of transfer
   - d/c Ceftriaxone/Vanc and start Unasyn for total of 7 days on Day 5 of
   Abx today.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts w/ goal hct 25
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   - if spikes consider adding vanc/zosyn back
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          repeat head CT
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT. Developed SDH in the setting of heparin ggt.  DVT
   not seen on KUB yesterday, underwent IVC filter placement on [**1-8**]
   -          Pneumoboots
   -          Discuss with neursurg adding heparin SQ
   # Anemia: Hct 25.4 in setting of hemodilution and hematuria-no further
   hematuria overnight after foley replaced by urology
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT (transfuse for hct < 25)
   - guiac stools
   - Flush Foley for clots/UOP, consult urology if does not improve
   - Consider EPO with HD
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Unclear baseline cr.  No need for
   urgent dialysis today.  Creatinine steadily rising.
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Renal US-f/u on read
   -          HD for today
   -          Holding nephrocaps because cannot be crushed, switch calcium
   acetate to carbonate for ease of crushing
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Drop from 140 to 88 overnight. DDx includes HIT,
   DIC, consumption in DVT/hematuria/Subdural organization.  Hemolysis
   workup negative
   -          FPM Platelet count- transfuse per neurosurgical guidelines
   # FEN: IVF boluses for hypotension, replete electrolytes cautiously,
   will start TF
   # Prophylaxis: R Pneumoboot, discuss heparin SQ with NS

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for septic shock and acute kidney injury. He was extubated without difficulty and requires permanent HD line placement. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He has allergies to NSAIDs and sulfa antibiotics. The patient received ceftriaxone and ampicillin/sulbactam antibiotics, which were discontinued. He is currently receiving several medications including furosemide, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), pantoprazole, and dilantin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.6°C, blood pressure ranging from 86/41mmHg to 145/69mmHg, heart rate between 83-101 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and his weight has increased from 69.5 kg at admission to 75.5 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 390 mL and output of 713 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -323 mL. The respiratory support shows spontaneous breathing with a tidal volume of 348 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 35%.

   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Continues to have seizures, concern for
   worsening SDH.
   - Minimize sedating medication and ativan
   - F/U NS and Neuro recs.
   - Treat underlying conditions below
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  Seems to be having R-sided eye and hand
   twitching that responds to ativan.  Corrected dilantin level 15 today
   - Dilantin 100mg IV Q8 with level in AM
   - Keppra load today per neuro
   - Follow Neuro, NSurg
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Unclear baseline cr.  No need for
   urgent dialysis today.  Creatinine steadily rising.
   -          F/U renal recs on HD
   -          Line: Per renal, reassess need for tunnel line in AM,
   current line sterile & stabile.  IR on call
   -          HD for today
   -          Holding nephrocaps because cannot be crushed
   # Pneumonia: Based on sputum gram stain, clearing with extubation.
   -          Unasyn course completed today
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          repeat head CT today in face of new seizures during rounds
   # Right toe eschar-unable to palpate, + Doppler pulses and concern is
   for arterial insufficiency.  Not anticoagulation candidate Prelim
   report on US showed SFA occlusion with reconstitution distal to
   popliteal
   -          Vascular consulted-follow recs
   -          F/U on final report of US
   -          F/U final read on CT-prelim reads + for AAA in throracic and
   infra renal, which are known from previous records
   -          Conitinue
 inch nitropaste to toes as needed
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT. Developed SDH in the setting of heparin ggt.  DVT
   not seen on KUB yesterday, underwent IVC filter placement on [**1-8**]
   -          Pneumoboots
   -          Heparin SQ
   -          IVC Filter in place
   # Anemia: Hct 24.0 in setting of hemodilution and hematuria-no further
   hematuria overnight after foley replaced by urology

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypertension (HTN), bladder cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, and hypotension. The patient was transferred from another hospital with subdural hematoma (SDH), seizures, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status due to seizures and worsening SDH, ongoing seizure activity likely from the SDH, acute on chronic renal failure with rising creatinine levels, pneumonia that is clearing with extubation, large subdural hematoma that is not causing altered mental status, right toe eschar with concern for arterial insufficiency, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with occlusion of the superficial femoral artery (SFA).

The patient also has a history of prior DVT and underwent IVC filter placement. She is currently on prophylactic measures including pneumoboots, heparin subcutaneously, and an IVC filter in place. The patient has anemia in the setting of hemodilution and hematuria, resolved thrombocytopenia, and requires fluid management and electrolyte repletion.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of SDH leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential neurological deterioration, further decline in renal function requiring dial"

   This is a 85 M w/ pmh of CRI, HTN, bladder cancer, DVT w/ IVC filter
   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Continues to have seizures, concern for
   worsening SDH.
   - Minimize sedating medication and ativan
   - F/U NS and Neuro recs.
   - Treat underlying conditions
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  No Seizure activity overnight.
   - Dilantin 100mg IV Q8 with level in AM

   # Pneumonia: Based on sputum gram stain, clearing with extubation.
   -          Unasyn course completed [**1-11**]
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          NSurg recs, no acute intervention
   -          Repeat Head CT today

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, bladder cancer, deep vein thrombosis with inferior vena cava filter, and hypotension. He was transferred from another hospital with subdural hematoma, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure, hypotension, large subdural hematoma, right toe eschar, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient continues to have seizures, which could worsen the subdural hematoma.
2. Seizures: Likely from the subdural hematoma. Dilantin and Keppra have been prescribed to manage seizures, and neurosurgical recommendations should be followed.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: Unclear baseline creatinine. Creatinine levels are stable but elevated. Renal recommendations should be followed, including hemodialysis and monitoring of renal function.
4. Pneumonia: Based on the sputum gram stain, it is clearing with extubation. The course of Unasyn antibiotics has been completed.
5. Large subdural hematoma: The neurosurgeon believes this is unlikely the cause of the altered mental status. No acute intervention is needed, but repeat head CT today and neurosurgical recommendations should be followed.

   Imaging: Head CT [**1-11**]: Stable left supratentorial subdural hematoma
   with stable mass effect, but no evidence of herniation. No new acute
   intracranial findings. MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
   Microbiology: No New Culture Data
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 M w/ pmh of CRI, HTN, bladder cancer, DVT w/ IVC filter
   transferred from OSH w/ SDH, seizures, acute on chronic renal failure,
   hypotension.
   # Altered mental status:  Continues to have seizures, concern for
   worsening SDH.
   - Minimize sedating medication and ativan
   - F/U NS and Neuro recs.
   - Treat underlying conditions
   # Seizures: likely from SDH.  No Seizure activity overnight.
   - Dilantin 100mg IV Q8 with level in AM
   - Keppra
   - Follow Neuro, NSurg Recs
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Unclear baseline cr.  Creatinine
   stabily elevated.
   -          F/U renal recs on HD
   -          Line: Per renal, reassess need for tunnel line this AM,
   current line sterile & stabile.  IR on call
   -          HD for today
   -          Holding nephrocaps because cannot be crushed
   # Pneumonia: Based on sputum gram stain, clearing with extubation.
   -          Unasyn course completed [**1-11**]
   # Large subdural hematoma: Per neurosurg, this is unlikely the cause of
   his altered mental status.   Per neurosurg, CT stable.
   -          NSurg recs, no acute intervention, no imaging indicated at
   this time
   # Right toe eschar-unable to palpate, + Doppler pulses and concern is
   for arterial insufficiency.  Not anticoagulation candidate Prelim
   report on US showed SFA occlusion with reconstitution distal to
   popliteal
   -          Vascular consulted-follow recs
   -          F/U on final report of US
   -          Continue
 inch nitropaste to toes as needed
   -          Add Fentanyl for pain control
   # DVT: H/o prior DVT. Developed SDH in the setting of heparin gtt.
   -          Pneumoboots
   -          Heparin SQ
   -          IVC Filter in place
   # Anemia: Hct 25.5 in setting of hemodilution and hematuria-no further
   hematuria overnight after foley replaced by urology
   -          Minizmize blood draws
   -          Transfuse for dropping Hct
   - guiac stools
   - Flush Foley for clots/UOP, consult urology if does not improve
   - EPO with HD
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Resolved.
   # FEN: IVF boluses for hypotension, replete electrolytes cautiously,
   will start TF
   # Prophylaxis: R Pneumoboot, discuss heparin SQ with NS
   # Access: R IJ dialysis cath placed at OSH, L IJ placed here on [**1-5**], R
   art line placed at OSH on [**1-5**]

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, bladder cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and acute on chronic renal failure. He was transferred from another hospital with a subdural hematoma (SDH), seizures, hypotension, and altered mental status.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including pneumonia, large subdural hematoma, right toe eschar, DVT, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypotension. 

The assessment and plan include minimizing sedating medication, following neurosurgical recommendations, treating underlying conditions, continuing with seizure medications, monitoring renal function, completing antibiotic course for pneumonia, consulting vascular surgeon for arterial insufficiency in the right toe, using pneumatic boots for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and maintaining appropriate glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the subdural hematoma leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential herniation, further episodes of seizures, progression of renal failure requiring dialysis, development of new infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), worsening of arterial insufficiency in the right toe, and deep vein thrombosis."
