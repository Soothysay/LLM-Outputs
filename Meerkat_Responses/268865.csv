","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a chief complaint of weakness and transaminitis. He has been improving neurologically since the administration of thiamine. The patient is nutritionally deficient and has a history of alcohol use, which raises the possibility of various medical complications. These include mild hepatitis, dry beriberi, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, weakness, coagulopathy, elevated lipase, hypoglycemia, and potential ICU care issues such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mild Hepatitis: The patient's best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis. Other differentials include viral, drug-mediated, vascular, autoimmune, or Wilson's disease. The patient's transaminitis isn't too impressive for toxin-mediated, viral, or vascular pathologies. Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests early liver disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of EtOH. A CT scan is suggestive of fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH level 110.
2. Dry Beriberi: This is a possible diagnosis since there is significant improvement in weakness just a few hours after large thiamine administration, and the patient is nutritionally deficient. Case reports of neurological weakness resembling Guillain-Barr√© syndrome have been found.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a chief complaint of weakness and transaminitis. The patient has been experiencing symptoms for three months and has a history of alcohol use.

The patient's vital signs show fever with a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, elevated heart rate of 135 beats per minute, low blood pressure ranging from 100/33 to 94/32 mmHg, normal respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted improvement in neuro signs after thiamine administration. The patient's physical examination is consistent with the admission note.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count of 9.1 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.1 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 164 mg/dL, slightly decreased creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and significantly decreased glucose level of 67 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low calcium level, low magnesium level, and low phosphate level.

The patient's assessment includes mild hepatitis with the best etiology being alcoholic hepatitis, dry beriberi, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, weakness, coagulopathy, elevated lipase, and hypoglycemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   39M with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi
   from severe thiamine deficiency.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.
   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,
   or Wilsons.   His transminitis isn't too impressive for toxin mediated,
   viral, or vascular pathologies.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly
   suggests early liver disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of
   EtOH. CT suggestive of fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH
   level 110.
   - Viral serologies pending
   - Autoimmune studies pending
   - Ceruloplasmin
   - Social Work Consult
   - Nutrition Consult
   Dry Beriberi
 this is a possible diagnosis since there is significant
   improvement in weakness in just a few
   hours after large thiamine administration and the patient is
   nutritionally deficient.
   Found case reports of the neurological weakness as in this case
   resembling gullian-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.

    Beriberi would also explain the extremely high lactic acidosis that
   paradoxically rose in setting of fluid resuscitation.
   This would also explain the patient
s primary metabolic acidosis and
   primary respiratory alkalosis.

   Med. [**2189**] [**Month (only) **];50(6):722-5. Epub [**2188**] [**1-6**].
   Hyponatremia: no ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and portal
   hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest
   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia
   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia
   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low
   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.
   - Bolus with D5NS and recheck lytes.
   AG Metabolic Acidosis: starvation ketosis with lactic acidosis with
   compensated pH. liver disease and alcoholism can lead to a decreased
   utilization of lactic acidosis.
   - Replete with D5 NS
   - calculated osmoles: 268
   - measures osmoles: 280
   - serum tox & utox negative
   Weakness: 3 months of progressive weakness in the setting of alcohol
   use raises the possibility of a nutritional deficiency.  Patient's
   thiamine ordered for concern of Thiamine deficiency.
   - Neurology consult
   Hypophosphatemia
 given the rapid onset, appears to be caused by
   refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia causes
   exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete stores in
   dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by hyperventilation bc
   nl RR.
   -          will replete aggressively, and hold D5 for now until
   replete.
   -
   Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC also
   a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.
   - DIC labs pending
   - FFP for procedures
   - Trend
   Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis.
   - Will follow
   Hypoglycemia: impaired hepatic gluconeogeneis in setting background of
   poor nutrition.
   - replete with oral and IV repletion of glucose
   - ADAT
   - Nutrition consult, cautious bc refeeding syndrome

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with weakness and transaminitis. The working diagnosis is dry beriberi from severe thiamine deficiency. The patient's symptoms have improved significantly after receiving large thiamine administration. Other potential diagnoses include mild hepatitis, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, weakness, hypophosphatemia, coagulopathy, elevated lipase, and hypoglycemia.

The patient's clinical presentation includes high lactate levels, respiratory alkalosis, primary metabolic acidosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoglycemia. The lab results show low levels of thiamine, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low potassium, low phosphate, and low magnesium. The patient also has a high lactic acid level and a prolonged PT/PTT with a low INR.

The assessment and plan section mentions that the best etiology for the mild hepatitis appears to be alcoholic hepatitis. Viral serologies, autoimmune studies, ceruloplasmin, social work consult, and nutrition consult are pending. Dry beriberi is suspected due to the significant improvement in weakness after receiving thiamine administration and the patient's nutritional deficiency.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis, exacerbation of hypoglycemia, progression of coagulopathy, and further decline in liver function. It"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**3-18**] Events:
   - tachycardia/trembling consistent with withdrawl, started on CIWA with
   valium 5 mg q2h PRN
   - spiked to 101, pan cultured, continued vanco/zosyn
   - received total 4 u PRBCs yesterday
   - hepatology consulted
   - neurology consulted
   - needed phos and mag repletion
   - echo: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional
   left ventricular wall motion appears normal, but cannot be definitely
   excluded given the patient's current tachycardia. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
   increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
   output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with vigorous global
   systolic function and high cardiac output. No significant valvular
   disease or pulmonary hypertension.
   Findings consistent with a generalized high-output state (early sepsis,
   anemia, thyrotoxicosis, peripheral AV shunting, beri-beri, etc.). If
   clinically indicated, would recommend repeating the study when the
   patient is less tachycardic.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of alcohol abuse. The patient has experienced several events since admission, including tachycardia and trembling consistent with withdrawal, fever spikes, and the need for red blood cell transfusions. The patient's condition has required consultation with hepatology, neurology, and the use of medications such as Valium and Haldol.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 115 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/58 mmHg to 149/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has been cultured for blood and urine. The trans thoracic echo reveals a mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with normal systolic function and no significant valvular disease or pulmonary hypertension. The patient is also showing signs of a generalized high-output state.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low calcium and magnesium levels. Other lab results, including liver enzymes"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**3-18**] Events:
   - tachycardia/trembling consistent with withdrawl, started on CIWA with
   valium 5 mg q2h PRN
   - spiked to 101, pan cultured, continued vanco/zosyn
   - received total 4 u PRBCs yesterday
   - hepatology consulted
   - neurology consulted
   - needed phos and mag repletion
   - echo: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional
   left ventricular wall motion appears normal, but cannot be definitely
   excluded given the patient's current tachycardia. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
   increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
   output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with vigorous global
   systolic function and high cardiac output. No significant valvular
   disease or pulmonary hypertension.
   Findings consistent with a generalized high-output state (early sepsis,
   anemia, thyrotoxicosis, peripheral AV shunting, beri-beri, etc.). If
   clinically indicated, would recommend repeating the study when the
   patient is less tachycardic.

   Assessment and Plan
   39M with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi
   from severe thiamine deficiency.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   # Weakness:  Likely due to Neurological beri beri, improving with
   thiamine replacement although seems to have plateaued
   - protecting airway, if desats would get ABG and evaluate for CO2
   retaining
   - continue thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement
   - neuro following, appreciate recs; have low threshold for LP if AMS
   and fever together
   - tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri,
   no signs of fluid overload
   - metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, beri beri explains very high
   initial lactate
   - also would explain respiratory alkalosis
   .
   # Withdrawl:  continue CIWA scale, requiring valium q 2 hrs, seems to
   be improving
   - cont CIWA
   - consider haldol for aggitation
   # Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.
   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,
   or Wilsons.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests early liver
   disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of EtOH. CT suggestive of
   fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH level 110.
   - liver team following
   - Viral serologies pending
   - Autoimmune studies pending
   - Ceruloplasmin
   - Social Work Consult
   - Nutrition Consult
   # Hyponatremia: no ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and portal
   hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest
   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia
   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia
   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low
   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.
   - Bolus with D5NS and recheck lytes.
   # Hypophosphatemia
 given the rapid onset, appears to be caused by
   refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia causes
   exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete stores in
   dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by hyperventilation bc
   nl RR.
   -          will replete aggressively, and hold D5 for now until
   replete.
   # Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC
   also a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.
   - elevated hapto, likely has hemolysis, unclear if has [**Name (NI) 5771**] syndrome
   in setting of heavy alcohol use
   - transfuse as neccessary
   #Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male admitted to the ICU with weakness and transaminitis. The working diagnosis is dry beriberi from severe thiamine deficiency. The patient has been improving with thiamine replacement, although it seems to have plateaued. Other issues include withdrawal symptoms, mild hepatitis, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, coagulopathy, and elevated lipase.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological complications due to thiamine deficiency (worsening of neurological beri beri)
2. Respiratory complications such as CO2 retention and respiratory alkalosis
3. Cardiac complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias
4. Gastrointestinal complications such as alcoholic pancreatitis
5. Hepatic complications such as further deterioration of liver function
6. Renal complications such as worsening of hyponatremia and hypophosphatemia
7. Coagulation disorders leading to bleeding or clotting
8. Infection-related complications due to immunosuppression and invasive procedures

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   39M with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi
   from severe thiamine deficiency.

   PLAN:
   ====
   Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.
   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,
   or Wilsons.   His transminitis isn't too impressive for toxin mediated,
   viral, or vascular pathologies.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly
   suggests early liver disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of
   EtOH. CT suggestive of fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH
   level 110.
   - Viral serologies pending
   - Autoimmune studies pending
   - Ceruloplasmin
   - Social Work Consult
   - Nutrition Consult
   Dry Beriberi
 this is a possible diagnosis since there is significant
   improvement in weakness in just a few
   hours after large thiamine administration and the patient is
   nutritionally deficient.
   Found case reports of the neurological weakness as in this case
   resembling gullian-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.

    Beriberi would also explain the extremely high lactic acidosis that
   paradoxically rose in setting of fluid resuscitation.
   This would also explain the patient
s primary metabolic acidosis and
   primary respiratory alkalosis.

   Hyponatremia: no ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and portal
   hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest
   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia
   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia
   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low
   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.
   - Bolus with D5NS and recheck lytes.
   AG Metabolic Acidosis: starvation ketosis with lactic acidosis with
   compensated pH. liver disease and alcoholism can lead to a decreased
   utilization of lactic acidosis.
   - Replete with D5 NS
   - calculated osmoles: 268
   - measures osmoles: 280
   - serum tox & utox negative
   Weakness: 3 months of progressive weakness in the setting of alcohol
   use raises the possibility of a nutritional deficiency.  Patient's
   thiamine ordered for concern of Thiamine deficiency.
   - Neurology consult
   Hypophosphatemia
 given the rapid onset, appears to be caused by
   refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia causes
   exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete stores in
   dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by hyperventilation bc
   nl RR.
   -          will replete aggressively, and hold D5 for now until
   replete.
   -
   Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC also
   a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.
   - DIC labs pending
   - FFP for procedures

   Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis.
   - Will follow
   Hypoglycemia: impaired hepatic gluconeogeneis in setting background of

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. Some of these include:

1. Thiamine deficiency: The patient's presentation with weakness, transaminitis, and improvement in symptoms after receiving large doses of thiamine suggests a possible diagnosis of dry beriberi. This condition is caused by severe thiamine deficiency and can result in neurological weakness.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a high lactic acid level and primary metabolic acidosis, which could be explained by beriberi. This condition can lead to an increase in lactic acid production due to impaired glucose utilization.

3. Hypophosphatemia: The patient has low phosphate levels, which may be due to refeeding syndrome. This condition can occur when a malnourished patient starts receiving nutrition again, causing an exaggerated response in phosphate depletion.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT/INR levels, indicating a potential coagulation disorder. This could be related to liver failure and poor nutrition.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has low blood sugar levels, likely due to impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis in the setting of poor nutrition.

6. Elevated lipase: The patient has elevated lipase levels, which could indicate subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis.

7. Refeeding syndrome: Given the patient's history of alcohol use and malnutrition, there is a risk of developing re"

The patient is a 39-year-old male with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi from severe thiamine deficiency. He has a history of alcohol use and presents with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, and metabolic abnormalities. The patient is currently receiving thiamine replacement and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Beri Beri: The patient's weakness and poor motor coordination indicate neurological involvement due to thiamine deficiency. Continuous monitoring and further management are required.
2. Withdrawal Symptoms: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, as evidenced by CIWA scale scores and the need for valium every 2 hours. Agitation may require additional interventions, such as haldol.
3. Mild Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and symptoms consistent with mild alcoholic hepatitis. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact etiology, and appropriate management should be implemented.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which could be due to hypovolemic or euvolemic causes. Further evaluation of urine electrolytes and assessment of fluid status is necessary.
5. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's low phosphate levels may be due to refeeding syndrome or excessive glucose administration. Aggressive repletion of phosphate stores is required.

   Assessment and Plan
   39M with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi
   from severe thiamine deficiency.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   # Weakness:  Likely due to Neurological beri beri, improving with
   thiamine replacement although seems to have plateaued. Does not appear
   infectious, d/c ABx [**3-20**].
   - protecting airway, if desats would get ABG and evaluate for CO2
   retaining
   - continue thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement
   - neuro following, recs to LP, [**3-20**], will consider MRI
   - tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri,
   no signs of fluid overload
   - metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, beri beri explains very high
   initial lactate
   - also would explain respiratory alkalosis
   .
   # Withdrawl:  Using ativan instead of valium since decreased hepatic
   metabolism. Continue CIWA scale, requiring ativan q 2 hrs, seems to be
   improving
   - cont CIWA
   - consider haldol for aggitation
   .
   # GIB
 appears to be lower given maroon stools. Patient bit tounge and
   minor mouth bleed.
   -         switching H2 to PPI
   -         will place NG tube and put on intermittent suction
   # Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.
   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,
   or Wilsons.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests early liver
   disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of EtOH. CT suggestive of
   fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH level 110. CMV negative.
   - liver team following
   - Viral serologies pending
   - Autoimmune studies pending
   - Ceruloplasmin
   - Social Work Consult
   - Nutrition Consult
   # Hyponatremia: no ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and portal
   hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest
   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia
   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia
   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low
   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.
   - Bolus with D5NS and recheck lytes.
   # Hypophosphatemia
 given the rapid onset, appears to be caused by
   refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia causes
   exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete stores in
   dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by hyperventilation bc
   nl RR.
   -          will replete aggressively, and hold D5 for now until
   replete.
   # Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC
   also a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.
   - elevated hapto, likely has hemolysis, unclear if has [**Name (NI) 5771**] syndrome
   in setting of heavy alcohol use. Patient with some blood in mouth from
   biting tounge, no seizure.
   - transfuse as neccessary
   #Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis.
   - Will follow, improving

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with weakness and transaminitis. The working diagnosis is dry beriberi due to severe thiamine deficiency. Thiamine replacement has been initiated and seems to be improving the patient's symptoms.

The patient is also experiencing withdrawal symptoms, which are being managed with the use of Ativan instead of Valium due to decreased hepatic metabolism. The patient's agitation may require the addition of Haloperidol.

The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by maroon stools. This could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or trauma from tongue biting. An NG tube will be placed for intermittent suction to prevent further bleeding.

The patient has mild hepatitis, possibly caused by alcoholic hepatitis. Other potential causes are being evaluated, including viral infections, drug reactions, vascular issues, autoimmune disorders, or Wilson's disease. Liver function tests and viral serologies are pending.

The patient has hyponatremia, which may be related to hypovolemia or beer potomania. Urine electrolytes suggest a low fractional excretion of sodium (FeNA), indicating hypovolemia. The patient will be given D5NS and rechecked for electrolyte imbalances.

The patient also has hypophosphatemia, likely due to refeeding syndrome. Phosphate levels will be repleted before restarting D5 glucose infusion.

The patient has a co"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-inch tall male with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2191-3-18**]. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received a stool culture at 01:00 AM to check for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Hepatology requested HIV, Hepatitis B viral load, and B12 levels. The patient's ABX will be discontinued if the culture negative after 48 hours. The patient's HCT remains stable, and a nasogastric tube (NGT) will be placed tomorrow morning if the patient is not adequately tolerating oral intake.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2191-3-19**] at 10:15 AM, Levofloxacin at 08:30 PM, Vancomycin at 09:00 PM, and Metronidazole at 06:21 AM on [**2191-3-20**].

The patient is currently receiving various medications including Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), Famotidine (Pepcid), and Diazepam (Valium).

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1¬∞C (100.6¬∞F), heart rate of 107 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure of 135/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,357 mL and output of 730 mL, with a net balance of 3,627 mL.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented, with warm and well-perfused skin, normal HEENT exam, clear lung sounds, nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and moving extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves, 4/5 strength in the upper extremities, poor motor coordination, and 3/5 strength in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever of 38.1¬∞C, and there is a concern for an unknown origin infection (fever of unknown origin or FUO). The stool culture for C. diff and ongoing antibiotic therapy suggest a possible gastrointestinal infection. Additionally, the elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreased, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine"

   Assessment and Plan
   39M with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi
   from severe thiamine deficiency.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   # Weakness:  Likely due to Neurological beri beri, improving with
   thiamine replacement although seems to have plateaued. Does not appear
   infectious, d/c ABx [**3-20**].
   - protecting airway, if desats would get ABG and evaluate for CO2
   retaining
   - continue thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement
   - neuro following, recs to LP, [**3-20**], will consider MRI
   - tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri,
   no signs of fluid overload
   - metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, beri beri explains very high
   initial lactate
   - also would explain respiratory alkalosis
   .
   # Withdrawl:  Using ativan instead of valium since decreased hepatic
   metabolism. Continue CIWA scale, requiring ativan q 2 hrs, seems to be
   improving
   - cont CIWA
   - consider haldol for aggitation
   .
   # GIB
 appears to be lower given maroon stools. Patient bit tounge and
   minor mouth bleed.
   -         switching H2 to PPI
   -         will place NG tube and put on intermittent suction
   # Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.
   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,
   or Wilsons.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests early liver
   disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of EtOH. CT suggestive of
   fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH level 110. CMV negative.
   - liver team following
   - Viral serologies pending
   - Autoimmune studies pending
   - Ceruloplasmin
   - Social Work Consult
   - Nutrition Consult
   # Hyponatremia: no ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and portal
   hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest
   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia
   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia
   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low
   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.
   - Bolus with D5NS and recheck lytes.
   # Hypophosphatemia
 given the rapid onset, appears to be caused by
   refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia causes
   exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete stores in
   dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by hyperventilation bc
   nl RR.
   -          will replete aggressively, and hold D5 for now until
   replete.
   # Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC
   also a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.
   - elevated hapto, likely has hemolysis, unclear if has [**Name (NI) 5771**] syndrome
   in setting of heavy alcohol use. Patient with some blood in mouth from
   biting tounge, no seizure.
   - transfuse as neccessary
   #Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis.
   - Will follow, improving
   .
   # HIV status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi from severe thiamine deficiency. He has been receiving thiamine replacement but seems to have plateaued. The patient's airway is being protected, and ABG will be evaluated for CO2 retaining. Thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement will continue. Neurological follow-up is planned, along with a recommendation for LP and possible MRI.

The patient also has tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri, with no signs of fluid overload. Metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, and beri beri explains the high initial lactate. Respiratory alkalosis is also present.

Withdrawal symptoms are being managed with ativan instead of valium due to decreased hepatic metabolism. CIWA scale is being used, and ativan is being given every 2 hours, showing improvement.

There are signs of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely lower GIB given maroon stools. The patient bit his tongue and had minor mouth bleed. An NG tube has been placed, and intermittent suctioning is being done. H2 blocker is being switched to PPI.

Mild hepatitis is present, with the best etiology being alcoholic hepatitis. Other differentials include viral, drug-mediated, vascular, autoimmune, or Wilson's disease. Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests"

   Assessment and Plan
   39M with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi
   from severe thiamine deficiency.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   # Weakness/ Beriberi:  Likely due to Neurological beri beri, improving
   with thiamine replacement although seems to have plateaued. Does not
   appear infectious, d/c ABx [**3-20**]. No weakness involving diaphragm.
   Unclear whether the prognosis of beriberi is reversible or not given B1
   and nutritional repletion. Metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, beri
   beri explains very high initial lactate and intial primary respiratory
   alkalosis. HIV neg.
   - continue thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement
   - neuro following, recs to LP, [**3-20**], will consider MRI after further
   discussion with neuro, cannot LP at this time given coagulopathy, will
   consider inpatient EMG
   - tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri,
   no signs of fluid overload
   - placed PT/OT consult [**3-21**].
   # [**Month/Year (2) **]:  Using ativan instead of valium since decreased hepatic
   metabolism. Continue CIWA scale with ativan- cont CIWA
   .
   # Vol overload
 appears on CXR and peripheral edema, patient 18L
   positive over course of admission.
   -         giving Lasix 40mg IV BID, goal negative 1L today
   # GIB
 appears to be lower given maroon stools. Patient bit tounge and
   minor mouth bleed. Patient on PPI and patient getting tube feeds
   through NG tube. In setting of coagulopathy.
   -         [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -         f/u GI recs
   # Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC
   also a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.
    Patient with some blood in mouth from biting tounge, no seizure.
   Patient given 1 u FFP with minimal improvement. Gave vitamin K 10mg IV
   x1 [**3-20**].
   - transfuse as necessary for LP
   #Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic
   pancreatitis. Initial lipase was 117, [**3-21**] is 808. Currently,
   continuing tube feeds.
   - Will trend daily and consider post-pyloric feeding if rising
   # Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.
   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,
   or Wilsons.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests early liver
   disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of EtOH. CT suggestive of
   fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH level 110. CMV negative.
   HIV neg.
   - liver team following
   - Viral serologies pending
   - Autoimmune studies pending
   - Ceruloplasmin
   - Social Work Consult
   - Nutrition Consult
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved. No ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and
   portal hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest
   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia
   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia
   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low
   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.
   # Hypophosphatemia
 Resolved. Given the rapid onset, appears to be
   caused by refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia
   causes exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete
   stores in dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by
   hyperventilation because normal respiratory rate.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male admitted to the ICU with weakness and transaminitis. The working diagnosis is dry beriberi due to severe thiamine deficiency. The patient has received thiamine replacement and is improving, although the weakness seems to have plateaued. No signs of infection are observed.

The patient's tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo are consistent with beriberi. There are no signs of fluid overload. The patient is positive for 18L over the course of admission, and Lasix 40mg IV BID has been given to address this.

The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, likely lower GI, given the maroon stools. This could be related to the use of an NG tube in a patient with coagulopathy. Fibrinogen levels are low at 192 mg/dL.

There is also evidence of elevated lipase, which could be from subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis. The lipase level has significantly increased from 117 to 808. Tube feeds are being continued.

The patient has mild hepatitis, possibly due to alcoholic hepatitis. Other causes such as viral, drug-mediated, vascular, autoimmune, or Wilson's disease should also be considered. A liver team is following up, and viral serologies and autoimmune studies are pending.

Hyponatremia has resolved, and there are no signs of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The initial thought is hypovolemic hypon"

   Assessment and Plan
   39M with weakness and transaminitis, working diagnosis of dry beriberi
   from severe thiamine deficiency.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   # Weakness/ Beriberi:  Likely due to Neurological beri beri, improving
   with thiamine replacement although seems to have plateaued. Does not
   appear infectious, d/c ABx [**3-20**]. No weakness involving diaphragm.
   Unclear whether the prognosis of beriberi is reversible or not given B1
   and nutritional repletion. Metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, beri
   beri explains very high initial lactate and intial primary respiratory
   alkalosis. HIV neg. EBV negative.
   - continue thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement
   - neuro following, recs to LP, [**3-20**], , cannot LP at this time given
   coagulopathy, will consider inpatient EMG
   - need to follow up MRI neuro pan-scan
   - tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri,
   no signs of fluid overload
   - placed PT/OT consult [**3-21**].
   # Withdrawl:  Using ativan instead of valium since decreased hepatic
   metabolism. Continue CIWA scale with ativan- cont CIWA
   .
   # Vol overload
 appears on CXR and peripheral edema, patient 18L
   positive over course of admission. Patient responding very well to
   Lasix.
   -         giving Lasix 40mg IV BID, goal negative 1L today
   # GIB
 appears to be lower given maroon stools. Patient bit tounge and
   minor mouth bleed. Patient on PPI and patient getting tube feeds
   through NG tube. In setting of coagulopathy.
   -         [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -         f/u GI recs
   # Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC
   also a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.
    Patient with some blood in mouth from biting tounge, no seizure.
   Patient given 1 u FFP with minimal improvement. Gave vitamin K 10mg IV
   x1 [**3-20**]. Given the increased PTT, stopping SQH.
   - transfuse as necessary for LP
   #Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic
   pancreatitis. Initial lipase was 117, [**3-21**] is 808. Currently,
   continuing tube feeds.
   - Will trend daily and consider post-pyloric feeding if rising
   # Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.
   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,
   or Wilsons.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests early liver
   disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of EtOH. CT suggestive of
   fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH level 110. CMV negative.
   HIV neg.
   - liver team following
   - Viral serologies pending
   - Autoimmune studies pending
   - Ceruloplasmin
   - Social Work Consult
   - Nutrition Consult
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved. No ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and
   portal hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest
   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia
   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia
   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low
   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.
   # Hypophosphatemia
 Resolved. Given the rapid onset, appears to be
   caused by refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia
   causes exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete
   stores in dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by
   hyperventilation because normal respiratory rate.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a working diagnosis of dry beriberi from severe thiamine deficiency. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1. Weakness/Beriberi: The patient's weakness is likely due to neurological beri beri, which is improving with thiamine replacement. However, it appears to have plateaued. It does not seem to be an infectious cause, and the patient does not have weakness involving the diaphragm. It is unclear whether the prognosis of beriberi is reversible or not given B1 and nutritional repletion. The initial metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, and beri beri explains the very high initial lactate and initial primary respiratory alkalosis. HIV is negative, and EBV is negative.

Plan:
- Continue thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement.
- Neurological follow-up, recommendations to LP, [**3-20**], cannot LP at this time given coagulopathy, will consider inpatient EMG.
- Follow-up MRI neuro pan-scan.
- Tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri, no signs of fluid overload.
- Placed PT/OT consult [**3-21**].

2. Withdrawal: The patient is using ativan instead of valium since decreased hepatic metabolism. Continue CIWA scale with ativan- continue CIWA.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a working diagnosis of dry beriberi due to severe thiamine deficiency. The patient has been experiencing weakness and transaminitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Neurological Beriberi: The patient's neurological symptoms, such as poor motor coordination and weakness, indicate the possibility of neurological beriberi. This condition can lead to further neurological deficits if not managed properly.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has maroon stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be related to the patient's coagulopathy and use of an NG tube.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is compromised, which increases the risk of bleeding. The patient has received Vitamin K supplementation but shows minimal improvement.

4. Hepatitis: The patient has mild hepatitis, which could be due to alcoholic hepatitis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact etiology of the liver disease.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient initially had hyponatremia, which has since resolved. It is important to monitor electrolyte levels and ensure proper management.

6. Hypophosphatemia: The patient experienced hypophosphatemia, likely due to refeeding syndrome. Close monitoring of phosphate levels and aggressive repletion are necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever.
- The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, acidosis, and malnutrition.
- Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure.
- Physical examination reveals warm and well-perfused skin, clear lungs, and normal cardiac findings.
- Neurological examination shows poor motor coordination, weak upper extremity strength, and decreased lower extremity strength.
- Laboratory results indicate anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated white blood cell count.
- Imaging studies include a head and full spine MRI with pending results.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by peripheral edema, anemia, malnutrition, fever of unknown origin, and electrolyte/fluid disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. The source of infection needs to be identified through cultures and further investigations.
2. Peripheral Edema: The presence of peripheral edema may indicate fluid overload or renal dysfunction. Monitoring fluid intake and output, as well as assessing renal function, is crucial.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition can contribute to poor wound healing, impaired immune function, and delayed recovery. Nutritional support should be provided to promote healing and recovery.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to nutritional deficiencies, blood loss,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction. He has been receiving various antibiotics and supportive care. On 2191-03-21, the patient developed a fever of 101.2¬∞F. His INR was measured at 2.0 and he tolerated tube feeds. Lasix was administered with appropriate output. An MRI of the head and full spine was completed, with results pending. The patient's NG tube fell out and was replaced overnight. Gastric contents with a small amount of red blood were noted, likely from his tongue. Tube feeds were held, Protonix was changed to Hospital1, and the patient will be reevaluated in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels suggest possible renal dysfunction, which can be a complication of severe infection or dehydration.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's peripheral edema and history of alcohol abuse may contribute to malnutrition, leading to impaired immune function and delayed wound healing.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show imbalances in sodium, potassium, and calcium levels, which can affect various bodily functions.
