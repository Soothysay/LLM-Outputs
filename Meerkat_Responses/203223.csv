   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyperglycemia and pneumonia. He has a history of dementia, CAD, MI, HTN, and CVA resulting in left hemiparesis. The patient presented to the ER with cough and shortness of breath, requiring 82% oxygen. A chest X-ray showed pneumonia. In the ER, he was transiently hypotensive but responded to IV fluids. His blood glucose level was found to be greater than 700 mg/dL, leading to the initiation of a heparin drip due to elevated troponin levels.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and hydralazine, with a rash as a reaction. He is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium and other ICU medications. He has a past medical history of complex multidrug-resistant infections.

The patient's vital signs are currently stable with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), and he is receiving respiratory support. His fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,001 mL and no output, resulting in a positive balance of 3,001 mL. He has wheezes in the right upper lobe on auscultation. His neurological status is poor, as he is inattentive and unable to follow simple commands. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated PT and PTT levels, while imaging shows an enlarging right upper lobe mass"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including diastolic heart failure, a history of Alzheimer's dementia, and a recent admission with similar presentation. He was admitted from a nursing home with fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been diagnosed with leukocytosis, right apical infiltrate, and an enlarging right upper lobe mass on chest X-ray, which is consistent with post-obstructive or healthcare-associated pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin and meropenem. The patient's blood pressure is borderline, so certain medications have been held. There are concerns about catheter-associated complications, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and pressure ulcers. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, tube feeds, and other supportive measures in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest a possible healthcare-associated pneumonia. This condition can be caused by bacteria that are resistant to common antibiotics, leading to a prolonged hospital stay and increased risk of mortality.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, which increases the risk of developing a bloodstream infection. These infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a non-stageable sacral decubitus"

","Summary:
The patient is a thin individual with poor dentition, who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. They have dilated pupils and a paralyzed left side. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 114/40 mmHg, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and a slightly elevated heart rate of 81 beats per minute. Their temperature is within normal range. The patient has been receiving fluids and vasopressor support to maintain their blood pressure above 55 mmHg. They are also receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, calcium, and magnesium are within normal limits. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated PT/PTT ratio and INR, indicating a bleeding tendency.

Plan:
The patient is being managed in the ICU for respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and potential sepsis.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old male with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, Alzheimer's dementia, and a history of multiple resistant infections. He has been admitted to the ICU with fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing both hypovolemic and septic shock due to inadequate fluid resuscitation. Immediate interventions include administering IV fluids, titrating down levophed (a vasopressor), treating sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and placing an arterial line for continuous monitoring.

2. Cough/SOB (Chest Pain with Shortness of Breath): The patient presents with leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and tachypnea (rapid breathing). A right apical infiltrate and an enlarging right upper lobe mass on the chest X-ray suggest a post-obstructive versus healthcare-associated pneumonia. Given his history of MRSA and ESBL Klebsiella, the patient is covered broadly with vancomycin and meropenem.

3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may be due to pneumonia as described above. Clostridium difficile infection is also possible, although the nonstageable sacral decubitus ulcer does not seem to be infected. Blood cultures, stool cultures, and s"

   fever curve and leukocytosis trending down on vanco/meropenem and IVF.
   Patient has liquid stool with mucous will add on vanco po and flagyl
   iv, send C.diff sample. Continue to monitor.
Elevated troponin: EKG at baseline continue ASA, holding bblocker due
   to hypotension
Hypotension: Sepsis, volume depletion from HONK, continue IVF volume
   resuscitation, wean levophed as tolerated. Place A-line.
Altered mental status: dementia, history of CVA, likely superimposed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of HONK and septic shock. They have been started on meropenem and vancomycin overnight but developed hypotension requiring low-dose levophed. Heparin was discontinued. The patient's heart rate improved after administration of atropine and bicarbonate. The patient has a history of poor dentition, dementia, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). They are currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, meropenem, insulin glargine, sliding scale insulin, ASA, synthroid, clonidine patch, MVI, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to post-obstructive pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Blood cultures are pending, and the patient's ventilation status should be closely monitored.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which needs to be managed with continuous insulin infusion. Insulin glargine received yesterday should be restarted once the patient's condition stabilizes.
3. Hypernatremia/hyperosmolar state: The patient is hypernatremic and in a hyperosmolar state. Intravenous fluids should be adjusted accordingly to avoid further complications.
4. Fever: The patient has a fever curve and leukocytosis trending down on vancomycin/meropenem. Additional antibiotics may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on respiratory support due to acute respiratory failure, which could be post-obstructive pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Monitoring VBG and considering sputum cytology and bronchoscopy is necessary.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 272 mg/dL. Insulin therapy, both sliding scale and glargine, is being administered to control blood sugar levels.

3. Hypernatremia/Hyperosmolar State: The patient also has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 125 mEq/L and an elevated osmolality of 320 mOsm/kg. Fluid resuscitation with NS and D5W is being given to correct the sodium imbalance.

4. Infection/Fever: The patient has a fever curve and leukocytosis, indicating an ongoing infection. Antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) have been started, and additional coverage with vancomycin orally and flagyl IV is being added due to liquid stool with mucus.

5. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient is somnolent, grimacing, and groaning. The altered mental status may be due to hypernatremia, infection, or superimposed delirium from a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

6. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is hypotensive and septic, requiring pressors (lopressor and levophed) and aggressive IV fluid resuscitation.

7. Elevated Troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, indicating possible myocardial injury. An EKG at baseline and ASA administration are ongoing.

8. Right Upper Lobe Mass: The patient's chest X-ray shows a mass in the right upper lobe, which could be a lung tumor or another pathology. Further evaluation is needed.

Please note that these are potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual situation may vary, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):
   Likely post obstructive pneumonia vs HAP, f/u blood cultures. VBG
   currently without significant hypercarbia will continue to monitor.
   RUL mass: send sputum cytology, will differ bronch currently ue to
   other higher priority medical illness currently.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA/hypernatremia/hyperosmolar state:
   Continue sliding scale insulin, recieved glargine yesterday, holding TF
   due to hypotension currently. Will restart IV insulin drip if sugars
   remain elevated
   Will give 1L NS bolus for hypotension, 1/2NS at 150cc, untill sugar
   <250 then change to D5W at 100cc.
 Fever:
   fever curve and leukocytosis trending down on vanco/meropenem and IVF.
   Patient has liquid stool with mucous will add on vanco po and flagyl
   iv, send C.diff sample. Continue to monitor.
Elevated troponin: EKG at baseline continue ASA, holding bblocker due
   to hypotension
Hypotension: Sepsis, volume depletion from HONK, continue IVF volume
   resuscitation, wean levophed as tolerated. Place A-line.
Altered mental status: dementia, history of CVA, likely superimposed
   delirium from hyperantremia and infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and hydralazine, with unknown reactions. The patient's medical history includes [medical history].

The patient experienced a peri-code event at [date] 10:46 AM, characterized by a blood pressure of 65/44 and heart rate in the 30s. Atropine and sodium bicarb were given, and levophed was increased to 0.5 mcg/kg/min. The patient responded to the treatment and was also given a 2L normal saline bolus, 4gm calcium gluconate, and 20 meq KCl. Levophed was weaned per blood pressure, and blood glucose was noted at 364.

The patient had a bradycardic event the previous day requiring 1mg atropine and sodium bicarb. Levophed was increased in the morning to 0.7, but the patient was able to be weaned off with fluid boluses and time. Sodium management involved increasing free water boluses and half-normal saline. Tube feeds were restarted, and the decision for full code was reviewed and confirmed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 124/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on nasal cannula for respiratory support.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 9,375 mL and output of 841 mL, resulting in a balance of 8,534 mL. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 272 mg/dL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates normal heart rhythm.

The patient's labs reveal a white blood cell count of 21.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, sodium of 125 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 27.6 mg/dL, and glucose of 272 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated PT and PTT, normal INR, low albumin, low calcium, and low magnesium levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's medical conditions include impaired skin integrity, Clostridium difficile infection, hypernatremia, hypotension (not in shock), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and hyperglycemia. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support and glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and there are plans for possible transfer to the floor later today pending hemodynamic stability."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, a history of nursing home residence, CVA with left hemiparesis, Alzheimer's dementia, and a history of multiple resistant infections. He was admitted previously for similar presentation and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has experienced several events over the past 24 hours. At 10:46 AM, he had a bradycardic event and was given atropine and sodium bicarb. Levophed was increased to 0.5 mcg/kg/min and he responded well. He received a 2L NS bolus, 4gm calcium gluconate, and 20 meq KCL. Levophed was weaned off, and his blood glucose level was 364.

Yesterday, the patient also experienced a bradycardic event requiring 1 mg atropine and sodium bicarb. In the morning, levophed was increased to 0.7, but with fluid boluses and time, he was able to be weaned off. His sodium levels were managed with increasing free water boluses and 1/2 NS. Tube feeds were restarted.

Allergies include penicillins, an unknown allergy, and a rash from hydralazine. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 10/7 and meropenem on 10/8.

The patient is a 71-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including diastolic heart failure, dementia, limited vocalization, hemiparesis, and a history of multiple resistant infections. He was admitted previously for similar symptoms and has been in the ICU since [**8-21**]. The patient has experienced several events in the past 24 hours, including a bradycardic event yesterday requiring atropine and sodium bicarb. His blood pressure has been unstable, requiring fluid boluses and an increase in Levophed. The patient's sodium levels were managed with free water boluses and half-normal saline. Tube feeds were restarted, and the family was updated on the decision for full code. The patient has allergies to penicillins, an unknown allergy, and hydralazine, which caused a rash. The patient received Vancomycin and Meropenem as antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
- Heart rate: 77 bpm (59-88 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 124/44 mmHg (62-156/75-95 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (15-26 bpm)
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination shows poor dentition, dilated pupils, symmetric chest expansion, and resonant percussion."

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Case discussed with Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 1162**] and [**Doctor Last Name **]  71 y/o man with complex PMH
   (dementia and FTT s/p G tube placement, chronic nursing home resident,
   non verbal at baseline, recurrent admissions for MDR UTI/ aspiration
   pneumonia, s/p CVA, NSTEMI, DHF, HTN, and DM) was  admitted with
   hypotension, hypoxia, HONK (NA 160, glucose 700s), fetl potentially
   from post-obstructive pneumonia from growing hilar mass vs C.diff.
   Main event was hypotense/bradycardic event yesterday that responded to
   medications.  Stable overnight.  Will continue present antibiotics and
   electrolyte/metabolic management.  Other issues as per the notes of
   Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 1162**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 6050**] today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history, including dementia, chronic nursing home residency, recurrent admissions for multi-drug resistant urinary tract infection and aspiration pneumonia, history of cerebrovascular accident, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient was admitted with hypotension, hypoxia, hypernatremia, and possible fever potentially from post-obstructive pneumonia due to a growing hilar mass or Clostridium difficile infection. The main event was a hypotensive/bradycardic event yesterday that responded to medication. The patient is currently stable and will continue with present antibiotics and electrolyte/metabolic management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. There may be a suggestion of cavitation, and sputum cytology should be sent. Broad coverage antibiotics (Vanco and Meropenem) are being given.
2. Hyperglycemia/Hypernatremia/Hyperosmolar State: The patient has hyperglycemia and hypernatremia, which are slowly improving. Free water administration through the gastrointestinal tube and discontinuation of D5 are planned. The total deficit is about 4 liters.
3. Infection: The patient has a fever curve and leukocytosis trending down on Vancom"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who experienced a cardiac arrest. They were resuscitated successfully and are now off pressors. The patient has respiratory failure, likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with a possible lung cancer. There is also hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and a hyperosmolar state, which is slowly improving. The patient has an underlying infection, as indicated by elevated troponin levels. They also have hypotension, which may be due to sepsis and volume depletion from heart failure. The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to dementia, a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and superimposed delirium from hypernatremia and infection. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they require transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to further respiratory distress or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The patient has an underlying infection, as indicated by elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and other laboratory findings. This infection may spread or become more severe, potentially leading to sepsis or septic"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):
   Likely post obstructive pneumonia vs HAP, f/u blood cultures. VBG
   currently without significant hypercarbia will continue to monitor.
   RUL mass: send sputum cytology, will differ bronch currently ue to
   other higher priority medical illness currently.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA/hypernatremia/hyperosmolar state:
   Continue sliding scale insulin, recieved glargine yesterday, holding TF
   due to hypotension currently. Will restart IV insulin drip if sugars
   remain elevated
   Will give 1L NS bolus for hypotension, 1/2NS at 150cc, untill sugar
   <250 then change to D5W at 100cc.
 Fever:
   fever curve and leukocytosis trending down on vanco/meropenem and IVF.
   Patient has liquid stool with mucous will add on vanco po and flagyl
   iv, send C.diff sample. Continue to monitor.
Elevated troponin: EKG at baseline continue ASA, holding bblocker due
   to hypotension
Hypotension: Sepsis, volume depletion from HONK, continue IVF volume
   resuscitation, wean levophed as tolerated. Place A-line.
Altered mental status: dementia, history of CVA, likely superimposed
   delirium from hyperantremia and infection.
   Remaining issues per ICU resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. They have multiple comorbidities, including respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state, fever, elevated troponin, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Monitoring and possible mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Hyperglycemia/Hypernatremia/Hyperosmolar State: The patient is experiencing hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and a hyperosmolar state. Insulin therapy will be continued, and careful fluid management is essential to prevent further complications.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. Antibiotic therapy will be adjusted based on culture results, and additional interventions may be needed to control the infection.
4. Cardiac Issues: The elevated troponin levels indicate cardiac involvement. Close monitoring of cardiac function, along with appropriate medications, will be necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, volume depletion, or other factors. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
6. Altered Mental Status"
