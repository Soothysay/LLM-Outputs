","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, currently undergoing treatment for recurrent lymphoma with the first cycle of ICE (ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, etoposide). The patient was transferred to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) on [**2130-6-4**] for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR) and lasix drip. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. Conversion to sinus rhythm at 07:45am on diltiazem drip.
2. Diltiazem drip discontinued after conversion.
3. The patient's baseline out-patient systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 120's.
4. Volume overload with several liters positive, likely due to recent chemotherapy.
5. Switching from IV lasix to oral lasix titrating up starting at 20mg po bid.
6. Scheduled for neupogen on [**2130-6-5**] (not currently neutropenic).
7. Oncology follow-up.
8. On levaquin for low-grade fevers.
9. Hypercholesterolemia: continue outpatient regimen.
10. Regular diet; check hospital lytes while diuresing.
11. PICC line placed on [**2130-6-4**] 08:56 PM.
12. Ambulate and pneumoboots.
13. Full code status.
14. Disposition: to the floor now that no longer needs lasix and dilt drips.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. AFib w/ RVR: The patient initially presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Although the patient converted to sinus rhythm with diltiazem drip, there is a potential risk of recurrent arrhythmias or development of heart rhythm abnormalities.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating volume overload. This can lead to congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or kidney dysfunction if not properly managed.
3. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has hypercholesterolemia, which if left untreated, can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease or stroke.
4. Chemotherapy-related complications: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy with ICE regimen. This treatment may cause various side effects such as neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or infections.
5. Potential for renal dysfunction: The patient's volume overload and ongoing diuresis with lasix may increase the risk of renal dysfunction.
6. Potential for respiratory complications: The patient is on supplemental oxygen, which indicates underlying respiratory issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, now with recurrent lymphoma. He was admitted to the MICU for heart rate management due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and started on a lasix drip. The patient converted to sinus rhythm on the diltiazem drip and his diltiazem drip was discontinued. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), current temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/52 to 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient received infusions of diltiazem at 8 mg/hour and furosemide (Lasix) at 5 mg/hour. He has been on other ICU medications as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AFib with RVR: The patient initially presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Although he converted to sinus rhythm on the diltiazem drip, there is a possibility of recurrence or development of other cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Volume Overload: The patient had several liters of positive fluid balance, likely due to recent chemotherapy. It is important to monitor his fluid status closely to prevent further fluid overload.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, currently admitted to the ICU for heart rate management due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was also receiving chemotherapy with ICE regimen (ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, etoposide). The patient has shown improvement in heart rate but still requires diltiazem drip to maintain a stable blood pressure above 96 mmHg. He is also on a lasix drip for volume overload, which is expected to be aggressive as long as his blood pressure remains above 95 mmHg. The patient is scheduled to receive neupogen on [**2130-6-5**] as he is not currently neutropenic, and his oncologist will be following up with him. He has been on levaquin for low-grade fevers the other day. The patient's hypercholesterolemia will continue to be managed with outpatient Lovastatin 20mg. He is currently on a regular diet and his electrolytes will be monitored while diuresing. The patient's PICC line was placed on [**2130-6-4**] at 08:56 PM. He is encouraged to ambulate and his code status remains as full code. The patient will remain in the ICU overnight and while on lasix/dilt drips, and is likely to be discharged to the floor prior to discharge to home."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation and lymphoma. They have been receiving infusions of Diltiazem and Furosemide. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with an irregularly irregular rhythm. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general, cardiovascular, abdominal, or extremity assessments. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood urea nitrogen level. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (88/52 mmHg), which may indicate hypotension. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Respiratory issues: Although the patient's respiratory rate is normal, their oxygen saturation is at 93%, which is below the normal range (95-100%). This indicates inadequate oxygenation and may require further intervention to improve respiratory function.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance of -1,125 mL since 12 AM, indicating fluid loss. This could be due to diuresis from Furosemide or other causes. Fluid imbalance can lead to"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma now with recurrent lymphoma, admitted for the first cycle of ICE treatment. He was transferred to the MICU on [**2130-6-4**] for heart rate management due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and a lasix drip. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 69 bpm with a range of 62-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/65 mmHg to 130/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 714 mL and total output of 1690 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -976 mL. He has received a total of 630 mL of IV fluids and lost 100 mL through stool. His urine output has been 1690 mL. 

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 6.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 33.4%, platelet count of 150 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 30 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 118 mg/dL, calcium of 8.0 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.6 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include management for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, conversion to sinus rhythm with diltiazem drip, and consideration of starting coumadin after discussion with oncology. The patient also has volume overload, possibly due to recent chemotherapy, and is unable to tolerate IV lasix boluses. Therefore, the plan is to switch from IV to oral lasix and titrate up starting at 20 mg twice a day. 

Additionally, the patient has completed chemotherapy with ICE (ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, etoposide) and is scheduled for neupogen on [**2130-6-5**]. He is on levaquin for low-grade fevers and will continue his outpatient regimen for hypercholesterolemia. The patient is advised to maintain a regular diet and check electrolytes while diuresing. He is encouraged to ambulate and use pneumoboots. His code status is full code, and he is to be discharged to the floor once no longer needing lasix and diltiazem drips."

   with assessment and plan as above. We have iuresed him substantially so
   hopefully his PAF will now be easier to control.  Hopefully he will not
   need a second [**Doctor Last Name **].  His counts are beginning to decline and he is not
   currently a candidate for systemic anticoagulation but should be

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and recurrent lymphoma, currently receiving the first cycle of ICE treatment. He was admitted to the MICU on [**2130-6-4**] for heart rate management due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been in normal sinus rhythm since the previous day and experienced a run of premature ventricular contractions around midnight. His kidney function has been repleted. He is being diuresed and reports feeling well, although he is unable to determine when his rhythm goes into atrial fibrillation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's initial presentation was atrial fibrillation with RVR, which required ICU admission for heart rate management. Although he has been in normal sinus rhythm since the previous day, there is still a risk of recurrence.
2. Volume overload: The patient had several liters of positive fluid balance, possibly due to recent chemotherapy. Aggressive diuresis overnight has been initiated to address this issue.
3. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has hypercholesterolemia, for which he is continuing his outpatient regimen of lovastatin.
4. Potential complications from chemotherapy: The patient recently underwent chemotherapy with ICE (ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, etoposide). There is a risk of various complications associated with this treatment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, currently with recurrent lymphoma. He was admitted to the MICU for heart rate management due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR) and received a lasix drip. The patient's vital signs have stabilized, and he is currently in sinus rhythm. He is also receiving treatment for volume overload, likely caused by recent chemotherapy, and has been switched from IV lasix to oral lasix with a starting dose of 20 mg twice daily. The patient's recent chemotherapy included ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, and etoposide. He is scheduled to receive neupogen on [**2130-6-5**] and is being followed by oncology. The patient is also on levaquin for low-grade fevers. He has hypercholesterolemia and will continue his outpatient regimen of lovastatin 20 mg. The patient's diet is regular, and he will have his electrolytes checked while diuresing. He has a PICC line inserted on [**2130-6-6**] at 11:00 AM. The patient is encouraged to ambulate and use pneumoboots. His code status is full code, and he will be discharged to the floor once he no longer requires lasix and dilt drips.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, now with recurrent lymphoma, admitted to the ICU for heart rate management due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and lasix drip. He has been in normal sinus rhythm since yesterday and had a run of premature ventricular contractions around midnight last night. The patient's potassium level was repleted, and he is being diuresed. He reports feeling well and cannot tell when his rhythm goes into atrial fibrillation. He states that from looking at the monitor, his heart rate tends to be regular when he is sitting still and irregular with movement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate between 69-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/65 mmHg to 130/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 714 mL and total output of 1,690 mL since 12 AM, resulting in a negative balance of -976 mL. The patient's weight is currently 78.4 kg, compared to his admission weight of 80.2 kg.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 6.5"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with recurrent lymphoma who was admitted for the first cycle of ICE chemotherapy. He is currently in the ICU due to volume overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm. The patient has been receiving diltiazem for his AFib and has shown improvement in response to the medication. However, his blood pressure is somewhat borderline after taking oral diltiazem in the morning and receiving a 10mg IV dose once. The patient is being diuresed with Lasix and will continue to have his blood pressure monitored on the increased dose of diltiazem.

The patient also has bilateral crackles, indicating persistent volume overload. Thrombocytopenia is present, with a platelet count of 105 today. The patient's recent labs show elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels. Other lab results are within normal ranges. The patient underwent chemotherapy with ICE (ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, etoposide) and is scheduled to receive Neupogen 480mg SC daily. The patient's code status is full code and his disposition is to remain in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with recurrent lymphoma admitted for the first cycle of ICE chemotherapy. He has a history of volume overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR). The patient responded well to diltiazem on a prior admission but was not started on an increased level due to low blood pressure and heart rate. He is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient also has euvolemic volume overload with bilateral crackles, which may be secondary to bleomycin toxicity. His platelet count has decreased slightly to 80,000/mL due to chemotherapy. The patient is scheduled for neupogen 480mg SC daily to monitor ANC after chemotherapy. He also has leukopenia with a WBC count of 0.3. The patient's blood pressure is borderline, and his vital signs are stable. The patient is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. AFib w/RVR: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may recur, leading to hemodynamic instability and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Volume overload: The patient's euvolemic volume overload may progress, leading to pulmonary edema and compromised respiratory function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with recurrent lymphoma who was admitted for the first cycle of ICE chemotherapy. He is currently in the ICU due to complications including volume overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR). The patient has a history of PAF with chemotherapy in the past. His blood pressure is somewhat borderline after receiving oral diltiazem in the morning and a 10mg IV dose once. He responded well to a diltiazem drip during his previous ICU admission. The patient's bilateral crackles persist, indicating ongoing volume overload. Lasix is being used to diurese, and the dose of diltiazem is being increased. Coumadin is being deferred pending further discussion with the BMT team. The patient's platelet count has decreased slightly to 105 today, so it is being monitored, and heparin is being held off. The patient recently underwent chemotherapy with ICE (ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, etoposide) and is scheduled for neupogen 480mg SC daily. His code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with recurrent lymphoma who was admitted for the first cycle of chemotherapy. He is currently in the ICU due to volume overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR). The patient responded well to a diltiazem drip previously but experienced recurrent AFib w/RVR and was re-transferred to the ICU. His blood pressure is somewhat borderline after receiving oral diltiazem in the morning and a one-time 10mg IV dose.

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and has undergone chemotherapy in the past, which may have contributed to the development of AFib w/RVR. The plan is to continue diuresing with lasix to manage volume overload, monitor the patient's platelet count for thrombocytopenia, and hold off on additional diltiazem due to borderline blood pressure.

The patient received chemotherapy with ICE (ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, etoposide) and is scheduled for neupogen on [**2130-6-5**] (not currently neutropenic). The oncology team will follow up with the patient.

Other medical issues include hypercholesterolemia, for which the patient will continue his outpatient regimen of lovastatin 20mg. The patient's nutrition will remain on a regular diet, and his glycemic control is currently controlled.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with recurrent lymphoma admitted for the first cycle of ICE chemotherapy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by volume overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib w/RVR). He previously responded well to a diltiazem drip in the ICU but was transferred back due to recurrent Afib w/RVR. The decision not to increase diltiazem was made because of low blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg, SpO2 of 95%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has decreased from 80.2 kg at admission to 78.4 kg currently.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation overnight but is currently in sinus rhythm. There are no known drug allergies. The patient received infusions and other medications, including diltiazem, levoquin, and Lovastatin. There were no changes to the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has had a total input of 513 mL, with 460 mL taken orally, 53 mL through intravenous fluids, and a total output of 3,700 mL. The"

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 3533**] is a 71-year-old male with re-current lymphoma, admitted
   for first cycle of ICE, course complicated by volume overload and Afib
   with RVR.
   .
   #. AFib w/RVR: likely [**12-31**] recent chemotherapy, given h/o PAF with chemo
   in the past.  He was re-transferred to the ICU this AM for recurrant
   Afib with RVR to the 150's.  He responded well to dilt drip one day
   prior.  BP somewhat borderline this AM after getting po dilt in AM and
   10mg IV x1.
   -- continue to diurese with lasix gtt
   -- deferring coumadin for now pending further discussion with
   -- hold off on additional dilt for now given borderline blood pressure

   #. Volume overload: still approximately 5 pounds over baseline, slight
   bump in creatinine overnight.
   -- resume lasix drip
   -goal 1-2 L negative today
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia - slight decrease in PLT over past several days to
   130's today.
   -monitor PLT count
   -continue holding off on heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with recurrent lymphoma who was admitted for the first cycle of ICE chemotherapy. The patient's course has been complicated by volume overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AFib w/RVR: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with chemotherapy in the past. The recent episode of AFib with RVR was managed with diltiazem drip, but the patient was transferred back to the ICU due to recurrent AFib with RVR in the 150's. The decision to continue or withhold additional diltiazem should be based on the patient's blood pressure. Anticoagulation therapy may be considered after further discussion with the healthcare team.
2. Volume Overload: The patient remains approximately 5 pounds over baseline, with a slight bump in creatinine overnight. Diuretic therapy with lasix should be resumed to achieve a goal of 1-2 liters negative fluid balance today.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to the 130's over the past few days. Close monitoring of the platelet count is recommended, and heparin therapy should be withheld due to the risk of bleeding.
4. Chemotherapy: The patient has received ICE chemotherapy (ifosfamide, mesna, carboplatin, etoposide). Neupogen"
