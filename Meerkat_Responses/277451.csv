","Summary:
- 53-year-old patient with recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
- Presented to the hospital with pneumonia and underwent Y-stent removal
- Transferred to the ICU for further management
- Currently intubated for airway protection and mechanical ventilation
- Hypotension likely due to sepsis or possible adrenal insufficiency
- Pneumonia involving both right upper lobe and left lower lobe
- Thrush in the airway
- Anemia and thrombocytopenia possibly secondary to chemotherapy
- Decadron use possibly part of chemotherapy regimen
- Multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungal, and stress dose steroids
- Need for central access due to superior vena cava compression by tumor
- Consults with ID and IP teams appreciated
- Unknown duration of steroid therapy
- Plans for nutrition and glycemic control in place

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: There is a possibility of adrenal insufficiency due to recent steroid use, which can cause hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Pneumonia: The patient"

The patient underwent bronchoscopy and stent removal, but unfortunately, could not be extubated post-procedure due to substantial pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension, possibly due to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency secondary to recent steroid use. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management, including fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support if necessary.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has both right upper lobe (RUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia, which may be post-obstructive in nature due to the NSCLC. There is a risk of progression of the pneumonia and development of antibiotic resistance.

4. Candidiasis: The patient has thrush in the airway, indicating an infection with Candida species. This requires appropriate antifungal treatment to prevent further spread and complications.

5. Anemia and Thromb"

","Summary:
- 53-year-old patient with recent diagnosis of NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer)
- Presented to OSH with pneumonia
- Y-stent was removed yesterday
- Transferred to the ICU for further management
- Currently intubated for respiratory failure due to substantial pneumonia
- Hypotension likely due to sepsis or possible adrenal insufficiency
- Thrush in airway
- Thrush in airway
- Anemia and thrombocytopenia possibly secondary to recent chemotherapy
- Multiple ongoing treatments and assessments for various conditions

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is being mechanically ventilated. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in lung function.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension suggests the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: There is a concern for adrenal insufficiency due to recent steroid usage. If left untreated, this can result in life-threatening complications.
4. Candidiasis (Thrush): The presence of thrush in the airway indicates an opportunistic fungal infection. If not managed appropriately, it can spread and cause significant respiratory distress.
5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: These conditions may worsen if not properly addressed, potentially leading to decreased"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old individual with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. The patient underwent y-stent removal and is now being managed in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 88 to 107 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 77 to 121 mmHg, respiratory rate between 17 and 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 10 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 159 mg/dL, and normal platelet count of 109 K/uL. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium at 3.6 mEq/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension, respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, other, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, and septic shock. The respiratory failure is classified as hypoxemic, and the PEEP will be increased to 12. Sepsis treatment with c"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent stent removal and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She also has hypotension likely secondary to sepsis and possible adrenal insufficiency. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. She has a history of NSCLC and was on steroids as part of her chemotherapy regimen. Her current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and fluconazole. She is also on prophylactic bactrim and subcutaneous heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension and fever, suggesting possible sepsis. There is a risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not managed appropriately.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency due to recent steroid use. This could lead to"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent Y-stent removal and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to airway protection and substantial pneumonia. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, with settings adjusted to address respiratory failure. ABGs (arterial blood gases) will be monitored.

2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis, which may be causing low blood pressure. Fluid bolus is being administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Pressors may be required if fluid resuscitation is not effective. Steroids have been continued, and weaning of sedation will be considered as possible.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has both right upper lobe (RUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. There is concern about immunosuppression due to steroid usage, and thrush has been noted in the airway. BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) cultures, blood cultures, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued. ID (infectious disease) consult is appreciated.

4. NSCLC: The patient's lung cancer diagnosis may be associated with recent chemotherapy treatment. The use of Decadron (steroid) may have"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent a Y-stent removal procedure and was admitted to the ICU for further management due to respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP to 12, and her ABGs are being monitored. She also has hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis, and she has been receiving fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The patient's pneumonia is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and she is also on antifungal prophylaxis. Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. She has a history of steroid use, which may have contributed to her immunosuppression. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, and she is already receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation. There is a risk of progression to septic shock and multi"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and is now experiencing respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for her pneumonia, including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. Her vital signs show a fever, with a maximum temperature of 101.3°F (Tmax: 38.5°C) and a current temperature of 100.7°F (Tcurrent: 38.2°C). Her heart rate is 92 bpm, blood pressure is 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90% on 65% FiO2. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds in the right apex and left base, and no peripheral edema. Her neurologic examination shows that she is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to stimuli, and has no movement or assessed tone.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 102 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 159 to 182 mg/dL, and"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with pneumonia.
- She was intubated for airway protection before a bronchoscopy and stent removal, but was not able to be extubated afterward.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, and her ventilator settings have been adjusted to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation using an ARDSnet protocol.
- The patient has been hypotensive, possibly due to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency, and has received fluid boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure.
- She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal medication, and has recently started on caspofungin for suspected fungal pneumonia.
- The patient has developed pressure ulcers, likely due to prolonged immobility, and there are concerns about possible herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.
- She has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
- The patient's electrolytes need to be monitored and repleted as necessary.
- She is receiving prophylactic heparin, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and bowel regimen.
- The patient's code status remains full, and she is currently in the ICU for further management.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent a Y-stent removal and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 88/49 to 132/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is sedated and not arousable.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 6.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 102 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate.

The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, hypotension, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, and electrolyte & fluid disorder. She is also at risk for fungal pneumonia due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy.

The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, starting caspofungin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. He underwent Y-stent removal and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has impaired skin integrity, hypotension, respiratory failure, acute cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, and other medical conditions. He is currently intubated for airway protection and mechanical ventilation due to substantial pneumonia. He also has electrolyte and fluid disorder, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible immunosuppression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has ulcers on the bottom, which could lead to further skin breakdown and potential infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a risk for shock and inadequate perfusion to vital organs.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
4. Cancer progression: The patient has NSCLC, and there is a risk of disease progression and spread.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which may require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications like cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: These conditions could lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent a bronchoscopy and stent removal but could not be extubated due to substantial pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and being treated for suspected fungal pneumonia. She also has hypotension possibly secondary to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency, as well as impaired skin integrity, anemia, and thrombocytopenia likely due to recent chemotherapy. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to the low oxygen saturation levels and the need for increased PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). Close monitoring of ABGs (arterial blood gases) and adjustment of ventilator settings are crucial to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be attributed to sepsis secondary to the pneumonia or possible adrenal insufficiency due to recent steroid use. Fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of blood pressure are necessary. If the patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation, the use of vasopressors may be required.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and is now experiencing respiratory failure. She has multilobar pneumonia and requires mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. If not managed properly, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Infection: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, indicating a severe lung infection. There is a risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body, potentially leading to sepsis and septic shock.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low potassium (K+), low magnesium (Mg++), and high glucose (Glucose). These imbalances can affect various organ functions and require close monitoring and management.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to immobility or pressure ulcers caused by prolonged bed rest. This can increase the risk of infection and poor wound healing.

5. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing mild hypotension, which may be related to sepsis or the use of sedatives. Proper fluid management and careful"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent was removed yesterday,
   transferred to the ICU team for further management.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pneumonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure
   -continue broad spectrum abx.
   - started bactrim ppx given steroids treatment.
   - continue mechanical ventilation - A/C switch to ardsnet settings
   yesterday, trying to titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to pCO2 of 60 and pO2 of 60
   or >
   - follow ABGs.
   -follow ID recs.
   -start caspafungin, DC fluconazole.
   -consider balloon placement if continued difficulty ventilating.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely sepsis, initially thought to be possible adrenal
   insufficiency, having been on steroids recently.
   - fluid bolus to keep MAP>65, has not yet required pressors.
   - wean sedation as possible.  Increased yesterday due to dyssynchrony,
   but reduced slightly overnight.
   - continue steroids - currently Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q12H 2 days ago
   (will need 2 wk taper).
   - will reduce today
 4 mg Qam, 2 mg Qpm, then plan for 2 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   tomorrow.
   .
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   noted to  have thrush in airway.
   -+/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible
   to do any stenting to relieve obstruction
   - fup BAL cultures, blood cx
   - continue zosyn, cipro, vancomycin and fluconazole for now.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   able to d/c fluc as starting caspo
   -will start  caspo for fungal pna (the tree in [**Male First Name (un) **] part, not the
   postobstructive part) in the setting of immunosuppression/chem
   -On bactrim prophylaxis
   - ID consult appreciated.

   # ?ulcers c/w HSV on bottom
   -could swab for HSV
   .
   # NSCLC - Decadron use was possibly part of her chemotherapy regimen.
   Unknown duration of steroid therapy
   - decadron as above; bactrim ppx
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
   chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with pneumonia.
- She underwent stent removal and bronchoscopy but was not able to be extubated post-procedure due to substantial pneumonia.
- The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is on mechanical ventilation with A/C mode, using ARDSnet settings.
- She has hypotension likely due to sepsis and possibly adrenal insufficiency, given recent steroid treatment.
- There are concerns about immunosuppression due to steroid usage, and the patient has thrush in the airway.
- The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
- She also has perianal ulcers suspected to be caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV).
- The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal medication, and antiviral medication as per ID recommendations.
- She is also on prophylactic medications including subcutaneous heparin, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and bowel regimen.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/62 mmHg to 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent stent removal and bronchoscopy but was not able to be extubated due to substantial pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings. She has multiple comorbidities including hypotension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and cancer. The patient is also experiencing anemia and thrombocytopenia likely secondary to chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or complications related to prolonged intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension suggests possible sepsis, especially considering the presence of pneumonia and immunosuppression due to steroids and chemotherapy.
3. Fungal Infection: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of thrush in the airway, there is a risk of developing a fungal infection, for which caspofungin has been started.
4. Bloodstream Infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, which increase the risk of bloodstream infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent bronchoscopy and stent removal, but due to substantial pneumonia, she was not able to be extubated and remains intubated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation with adjustments to the respiratory settings based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension likely secondary to sepsis. Fluid bolus has been given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and the use of pressors may be considered if necessary. Weaning of sedation is ongoing, but reduced slightly overnight.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has both right upper lobe (RUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. Given her recent steroid usage, there is concern for immunosuppression. Therapeutic bronchoscopic intervention may be considered, and cultures are being followed. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, including Zosyn, Cipro, Vancomycin, and Fluconazole.

4. Fungal Pneumonia: Due to immunosuppression and chemotherapy, the patient is at risk for fungal pneumonia. Casp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent a Y-stent removal and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and has worsening left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, which could be due to infection, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload. She has multiple medical complications including septic shock, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, and cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia and her inability to clear secretions. There is a concern for possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it has been deferred.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and worsening condition suggest sepsis, possibly related to post-obstructive pneumonia as a source. Fluid boluses are being given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has both right upper lobe (RUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. Immunosuppression from steroid usage is a concern, and thrush in the airway has been noted.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known Lastname 4443**] is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and post-obstructive pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU for airway protection and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting possible infection, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload. The assessment and plan include continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and antifungal therapy. Lasix was given to diurese fluid from the lungs if pulmonary edema is present. The patient is also receiving steroid treatment for cancer diagnosis, which increases the risk of immunosuppression and infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely related to sepsis, possibly caused by post-obstructive pneumonia. Prompt administration of fluid boluses and appropriate antibiotics is crucial to treat the infection and stabilize blood pressure.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has both right upper lobe (RUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and further cultures should be obtained to identify the causative organisms.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and post-obstructive pneumonia. She presented to the hospital with pneumonia and underwent stent removal, but due to substantial pneumonia, she was not able to be extubated. The patient's condition has continued to deteriorate, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray. The assessment includes respiratory failure, septic shock, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute respiratory failure, malignancy (lung cancer), and anemia/thrombocytopenia secondary to chemotherapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection and inability to breathe on her own post-bronchoscopy and stent removal. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the pneumonia worsens or if there is progression of lung cancer.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and worsening condition indicate a possible septic shock, likely caused by post-obstructive pneumonia. If not managed promptly, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of perianal ulcers raises concerns about impaired skin integrity. If these ulcers are caused by an infection such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), it could lead to worsening skin breakdown and potential systemic spread.

   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics given prior gram [**Last Name (LF) 411**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] add
   IV bactim 320 mg IV q8H given + culture for stenotrophomonas
   - continue mechanical ventilation and titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to goal of

   - follow up serial ABG
   - will consider balloon placement considering developing bilateral air
   space disease to identify optimal PEEP
   - will defer bronchoscopy for now as patient remains tenuous on current

   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotics pending cultures (estimated
   2-3 days) and add IV bactrim for culture + stenotrophomonas, will
   continue antifungal coverage with micafungin given appearance of thrush

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating possible infection, hemorrhage, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has perianal ulcers, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and titrate settings based on ABG results. Bronchoscopy has been deferred for now. The patient's code status is full code, and discussions regarding goals of care will be held with the family daily.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and not ARDS. There is a concern for worsening bilateral air space disease, which may require balloon placement to identify optimal PEEP levels.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive pneumonia as the source. Close monitoring and PRN bolus administration will be done to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive right upper lobe pneumonia, which is worsening with airspace disease throughout the left lung field, likely"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent was removed and patient was
   transferred to the ICU team for further management.
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pneumonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure.   Patient
   continues to deteriorate with CXR demonstrating worsening left sided
   infiltrates concerning for infection vs. carcinomatosis vs. fluid
   overload.
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis given ongoing steroid treatments for
   cancer diagnosis
   - continue mechanical ventilation titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to goal of
   pCO2 60 and pO2  > / = 60
   - follow ABGs.
   - f/u CXR post diuresis, consider additional Lasix if interval
   improvement from yesterday
   - will defer balloon placement considering asymmetry of air space
   disease between lung fields
   - consider bronchoscopy if continued de-sats to exclude diffuse
   pulmonary hemorrhage
   - follow serial hemoatocrits to exclude pulmonary hemorrhage
 will
   consider bronchoscopy if continued de-sats
   # Hypotension
 likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive
   pneumonia as source
   - will continue fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65
   - continue steroids - Dexamethasone 2 mg IV BID to complete  2 wk taper
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   also noted to have thrush in airway.
   +/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible
   to do any stenting to relieve obstruction
   - fup BAL cultures, blood cx
   - continue zosyn, cipro, and micafungin and bactrim prophylaxis given
   immunosuppresion, vancomycin discontinued as no indication for MRSA and
   zosyn will cover other G+ organisms.
   - consult with ID regarding possible treatment for HSV pneumonia
   considering appearance of perianal ulcers
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [**Known Lastname 4443**], a 53-year-old female, has been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and presents with post-obstructive pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection prior to bronchoscopy and stent removal but was not able to be extubated post-procedure due to substantial pneumonia. The patient continues to deteriorate, and her chest X-ray shows worsening left-sided infiltrates, which could be caused by infection, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload.

The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and bactrim prophylaxis due to ongoing steroid treatments for her cancer diagnosis. She remains mechanically ventilated, and her respiratory settings are being titrated to maintain a goal of pCO2 60 and pO2 > / = 60. Serial arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements are being followed. A diuresis is planned, and additional Lasix may be considered if there is improvement from yesterday.

A balloon placement has been deferred considering the asymmetry of air space disease between lung fields. Bronchoscopy may be considered if there are continued desaturations to exclude diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. Serial hematocrits will be monitored to exclude pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive pneumonia as the source. Fluid boluses will be given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65"

   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed was removed.  She was noted
   to have thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and
   it was decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the
   severity of her PNA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea. She reported increased respiratory secretions, fevers, and chills. At the hospital, she was found to have pneumonia and there were concerns about a possible stent obstruction. She was transferred to the ICU for urgent bronchoscopy and stent evaluation. During the bronchoscopy, it was found that her y-stent migrated and was removed. The patient also had thrush in her trachea and was intubated for the procedure. Due to the severity of her pneumonia, she was not able to be extubated post-procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to deteriorate with worsening left-sided infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which could indicate worsening pneumonia or respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive pneumonia as the source. Fluid boluses are being given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has both a post-obstructive right upper lobe (RUL) and likely left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. Given her steroid usage, there is concern regarding immunosuppression. Therapeutic bronchoscopic lavage (BAL) cultures, blood cultures, and continuation of current antibiotics (zosyn, cipro, vancomycin, and micafungin) are recommended.
4. Perianal Ulcers: The patient has perianal ulcers, which may be caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). Further evaluation and consultation with infectious disease regarding possible treatment for HSV pneumonia should be considered.
5. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. Close monitoring is advised.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload. Diuretics like Lasix may be considered to help diurese fluid from the lungs if pulmonary edema is present.
7. Shock: The patient is in shock due to sepsis and the hypotension is not responding to fluids alone.
8. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to thrush or other infections.

Please note that the patient's condition is critical, and immediate medical intervention is necessary to address the potential complications mentioned above."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent Y-stent removal and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient continues to deteriorate, and her chest X-ray shows worsening left-sided infiltrates, which could be due to infection, hemorrhage, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia and possible spread of infection. She will continue on mechanical ventilation, and settings will be adjusted to maintain pCO2 at 60 and pO2 above 60. Serial ABG will be monitored. Balloon placement may be considered for optimal PEEP, but bronchoscopy will be deferred for now.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive pneumonia as the source. She will be given PRN boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive right upper lobe (RUL) pneumonia with worsening airspace disease throughout the left lung field, indicating the spread of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued pending culture results, and IV bactrim will be added for stenotrophomonas coverage. Antifungal coverage with mic"

   # Respiratory failure
 patient continues to deteriorate with CXR
   demonstrating worsening left sided infiltrates concerning for infection
   vs. hemorrhage vs. carcinomatosis vs. fluid overload
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics given prior gram stain, and
   continue IV bactim 320 mg IV q8H given + culture for stenotrophomonas
   - will f/u pan Cx drawn [**8-4**] and consider re-adding Vancomycin
   considering fever spike s/p D/C on [**8-3**] and jump in WBC from 10 to 17
   - continue mechanical ventilation and titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to goal of
   pCO2 60 and pO2  > / = 60
   - continue to follow serial ABG
   - will consider balloon placement considering developing bilateral air
   space disease to identify optimal PEEP
   - will continue to follow serial hematocrits to exclude pulmonary
   hemorrhage - stable
   # Hypotension
 likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive
   pneumonia as source
   - patient has remained stable and has not required pressors, will bolus
   PRN to maintain MAP > 65
   # PNA
 patient with post-obstructive RUL and now worsening airspace
   disease throughout left lung field likely representing spread of
   infection.  Patient was also noted initially to have thrush in mouth at
   intubation in the setting of steroid therapy for her cancer diagnosis.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotics pending cultures (estimated
   2-3 days) and IV bactrim for culture + stenotrophomonas, will continue
   antifungal coverage with micafungin given appearance of thrush and
   immunosuppresion.
   - will consider adding Vancomycin given fever spikes s/p DC on [**8-3**] and

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**], a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, is currently in the ICU due to post-obstructive pneumonia and worsening bilateral airspace disease. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, an increase in white blood cell count, and fluctuations in blood gases without changes in ventilator settings. She is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 18 cmH2O. The patient's condition is deteriorating, and there are concerns about infection, hemorrhage, carcinomatosis, and fluid overload. She has a history of chemotherapy and is immunosuppressed, which may have contributed to her current state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for worsening respiratory failure due to infection, hemorrhage, or other factors.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever spikes, elevated white blood cell count, and worsening clinical condition suggest the possibility of sepsis, potentially secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive total input of 4,064 mL and a positive IVF input of 2,397 mL over the past 24 hours. This could indicate fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**], a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is currently in the ICU with post-obstructive pneumonia and worsening bilateral airspace disease. She has experienced a temperature spike, an increase in white blood cell count, and fluctuations in blood gases without changes in ventilator settings. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection. She also has a history of anemia and thrombocytopenia likely secondary to chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have intermittent deteriorations while on mechanical ventilation, with worsening chest X-ray findings concerning for infection. There is a need to continue mechanical ventilation and titrate FiO2 and PEEP to achieve a goal pO2 of >60. Balloon placement may be considered to identify optimal PEEP pressures if continued de-saturation on vent occurs.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive right upper lobe (RUL) pneumonia with worsening airspace disease throughout the lung fields bilaterally, likely representing the spread of infection. Given her immunosuppressed state due to steroid therapy for malignancy and oral thrush observed at the time of intubation, broad-spectrum antibiotics including IV Bactrim for Cx positive Stenotrophomonas and micafungin for fungal coverage should be continued.

141589.0,277451,2178-08-06 07:02:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed.  She was noted to have
   thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and it was
   decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the severity
   of her PNA.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:  53 yof w/ recent dx of NSCLC who presented to OSH
   with pneumonia.  Y-stent removed and patient was transferred to ICU,
   intubated for further management.
   # Respiratory failure
 patient continues
   continues to have intermittent deteriorations while on vent with
   worsening CXR concerning for infection
   - continue mechanical ventilation and titrate FIO2, PEEP to goal pO2  >
   / = 60
   - f/u pan-cultures drawn [**8-4**] for temperature spike
   - f/u PM ABG s/p FIO2 down to 65%
   - will consider balloon placement to identify optimal PEEP pressures if
   continued de-sat on vent
   # PNA
 post-obstructive RUL with worsening airspace disease throughout
   lung fields bilateral likely representing spread of infection.  Patient
   noted to initially have oral thrush at time of intubation in the
   setting of steroid therapy for her malignancy.  Patient now with
   temperature spike and WBC elevation to 17 from 10.
   - continue broad spec antibiotics with IV bactrim for Cx +
   stenotrophomonas with micafungin for fungal coverage in setting of
   immunosuppression and visualized thrush at time of intubation
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pan-cultures s/p temperature spike
   - consider adding Vancomycin given time course of fever spike s/p DC
   vanc on [**8-3**]
 also for other sources of infection including lines and
   VAP
 may DC after several days if BCx remain negative
   .
   # Perianal Ulcers
   -  f/u wound Cx for HSV - pending
   # NSCLC
 patient was receiving decadron initially for airway
   inflammation now on vent
   - hold off on full decadron taper considering picture of worsening
   infection
 do not want jeopardize steroid levels and adrenal function
   in current clinical setting
   - XRT deferred for now as peri-tracheal mass in RUL may lead to more
   disseminate infection and worsening clinical picture, also patient may
   not be able to tolerate transport out of the MICU at this time
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
   chemotherapy.
   - serial HCT to monitor for hemorrhage - stable
   # FEN: IVF bolus as above, TF, replete electrolytes, increased standing
   Lantus to maintain sugars < 200, may consider diuresis today
   considering 2 L positive since yesterday
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI, bowel reg.
   # Access: midline, 2  peripherals, A line
   # Code: DNR  (continued ongoing discussion with sister today re: goals
   of care)
   # Communication: Sister ; palliative care and social work following.

   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent removed and patient was
   transferred to ICU for further management.
   # Respiratory failure
 continues to have intermittent deteriorations
   while on vent with worsening CXR concerning for infection
   - continue mechanical ventilation and titrate FIO2, PEEP to goal pO2  >
   / = 60
   - f/u pan-cultures drawn [**8-4**] for temperature spike
   - f/u PM ABG s/p FIO2 down to 65%
   - will consider balloon placement to identify optimal PEEP pressures if
   continued de-sat on vent
   # PNA
 post-obstructive RUL with worsening airspace disease throughout
   lung fields bilateral likely representing spread of infection.  Patient
   noted to initially have oral thrush at time of intubation in the
   setting of steroid therapy for her malignancy.  Patient now with
   temperature spike and WBC elevation to 17 from 10.
   - continue broad spec antibiotics with IV bactrim for Cx +
   stenotrophomonas with micafungin for fungal coverage in setting of
   immunosuppression and visualized thrush at time of intubation
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u pan-cultures s/p temperature spike
   - consider adding Vancomycin given time course of fever spike s/p DC
   vanc on [**8-3**]
 also for other sources of infection including lines and
   VAP
 may DC after several days if BCx remain negative
   .
   # Perianal Ulcers

   # NSCLC
 patient was receiving decadron initially for airway
   inflammation now on vent
   - hold off on full decadron taper considering picture of worsening
   infection
 do not want jeopardize steroid levels and adrenal function
   in current clinical setting
   - XRT deferred for now as peri-tracheal mass in RUL may lead to more
   disseminate infection and worsening clinical picture, also patient may
   not be able to tolerate transport out of the MICU at this time
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
   chemotherapy.
   - serial HCT to monitor for hemorrhage - stable

Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**], a 53-year-old female with non-small cell lung cancer, was admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for dyspnea. She reported increased respiratory secretions, fevers, and chills. At OSH, she was found to have pneumonia and there were concerns about a possible stent obstruction. She was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchoscopy and stent evaluation. On [**7-29**], she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found that her y-stent migrated, so it was removed. She was noted to have thrush in her trachea. She was intubated for the procedure and decided to keep the patient ventilated post-bronchoscopy due to the severity of her pneumonia.

24-hour events:

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**], a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, was admitted to OSH for dyspnea. She reported increased respiratory secretions, fevers, and chills. Pneumonia was diagnosed, and there were concerns about a possible stent obstruction. She was transferred to BICMC for urgent bronchoscopy and stent evaluation. During the procedure, it was found that her y-stent migrated, and she was intubated for the procedure. Thrush in her trachea was also noted. Due to the severity of her pneumonia, it was decided to keep the patient ventilated post-bronchoscopies.

24-hour events included changes in antibiotics and considering replacement of midline if fever spikes continued or blood cultures were positive. Palliative recommendations were made as the patient's condition continued to decline despite aggressive treatments, recommending transition to comfort measures only (CMO) if the family agrees.

The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 91/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has increased from 55.3 kg at admission to 64.1 kg currently. Fluid balance showed a total input of 4,175 mL and output of 1,725 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,450 mL. The patient was receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and others.

Physical examination revealed diffuse rhonchi with decreased airflow throughout the right lung fields and left lower lobe. The patient's lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and other abnormalities. Blood cultures were pending.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's clinical status continues to worsen with a chest X-ray consistent for spreading infection. Goals of care and consideration of CMO with trial of extubation should be discussed. Mechanical ventilation should be continued, and FiO2 and PEEP should be titrated to achieve a goal pO2 of ≥60.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive right upper lobe with worsening airspace disease throughout the lung fields, likely representing the spread of infection. Oral thrush was initially noted at the time of intubation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with IV bactrim for CX+ Stenotrophomonas and micafungin for fungal coverage should be continued. If temperature spikes persist, meropenem and vancomycin should be added, and Zosyn should be discontinued. Pan-cultures should be followed up.
3. Perianal ulcers: Follow-up wound culture for HSV is pending.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.
- She was admitted to the hospital due to dyspnea, increased respiratory secretions, fevers, and chills.
- She was found to have pneumonia and there were concerns about a possible stent obstruction.
- She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy and it was found that her y-stent migrated. The stent was removed.
- Thrush was noted in her trachea.
- The patient was intubated for the procedure and decided to be kept ventilated post-bronchoscopy due to the severity of her pneumonia.
- The patient's condition has continued to worsen despite aggressive treatments.
- There are recommendations for transitioning to comfort measures only (CMO) if the family agrees.
- The patient has been experiencing temperature spikes, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
- The patient also has perianal ulcers, most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
- Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present, likely due to the chemotherapy.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her goals of care need to be clarified.
- There is ongoing discussion with the sister regarding defining CMO with potential trial of terminal extubation.
- The patient's condition is serious, and the healthcare team is considering replacing midline if fever spikes continue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent a Y-stent removal and was intubated for further management. The patient's clinical status has continued to worsen, and she is unlikely to improve now. The plan is to define goals of care and consider comfort measures only (CMO) and extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the goal of care shifts to comfort measures only, the patient may continue to receive mechanical ventilation until the family gathers. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient initially had oral thrush at the time of intubation, which could indicate an immunocompromised state. She has been treated with IV bactrim for Cx + stenotrophomonas with micafungin for fungal coverage. There is a risk of recurrent or worsening pneumonia.
3. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. Close monitoring for hemorrhage and serial HCT are recommended.
4. Perianal ulcers: The patient has perianal ulcers with a pending HSV culture. This could lead"

            This organism may develop resistance to third generation
            cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates
   that
            are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
            four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
   infections,
            repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
   warranted
            if third generation cephalosporins were used.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's clinical status continues to worsen, and it is unlikely that she will improve now that the Y-stent has been removed. The goals of care should be defined, and consideration should be given to comfort measures only (CMO) and extubation.

The patient has respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. She has post-obstructive pneumonia with worsening air space disease throughout the lung fields, likely representing the spread of infection. The patient initially had oral thrush at the time of intubation in the setting of steroid therapy for her malignancy. Her white blood cell count is down to 12.9 from 17.2.

The patient also has perianal ulcers that are culture positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV). Antibiotics should be discontinued, and medications should be continued as per the current guidelines.

The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.

In terms of prophylaxis, subcutaneous heparin, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and bowel regimen have been initiated. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, midline, and peripheral lines. She is on DNR (do not resuscitate) status, and there is ongoing discussion with the sister regarding the goals of care, considering CMO. The patient's disposition is currently ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate: 62 bpm
- Blood pressure: 94/53 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Blood glucose: 203 mg/dL

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 6.1 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 24.2%
- Platelet count: 331,000/mm³
- Sodium: 130 mg/dL
- Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
- Chloride: 96 mEq/L
- Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
- Glucose: 203 mg/dL

The patient's chest x-ray shows bilateral air space disease throughout the lung fields.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continued worsening of the patient's clinical status may lead to further respiratory compromise.

2. Infection: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia and oral thrush. There is a risk of developing additional infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation.

3. HSV infection:"
