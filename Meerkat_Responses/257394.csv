   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  Patient is a 57 y/o F w/
   hypercholesterolemia and known severe mitral valve prolapse who
   presented to [**Hospital6 **] ED on [**2183-1-31**] with three days of
   progressive dyspnea with exertion and orthopnea such that she could not
   breath while lying, could only sleep sitting upright.Had been having
   non prod cough, low grade fever for which she took tylenol  By report
   from OSH records, patient reported shortness of breath when lying flat
   for three weeks that had been getting progressively worse.  She
   reported a non-productive cough, and potentially had some sick
   contacts.  She took some tylenol prior to admission, but had no known
   fever.  OSH records do not describe chills, night sweats, or other
   complaints.  Remainder of ROS reportedly negative.AT OSH CXR showed
   bilateral infiltrates with bilateral pleural effusions, EKG showed LBBB
   but no prior to compare. She desated to 89, got 40 IV lasix without
   effect, placed on 100% non rebreather, improved only to 93% then
   intubated for inc work of breathing. Noted to have diastolic murmur,
   Cards consulted,bedside echocardiogram was performed showing severe 4+
   MR transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further management. Prior to transfer blood
   cx x 2 drawn and 1gram IV vanc given, levo and rocephin for possible
   endocarditis. Per report, pt was unstable enroute started on
   dobutamine. On arrival to ED, ABG: 7.41/37/215/24 with WBC 16.2, and
   fibrinogen was actually elevated at 644, PTT 25.8, INR 1.1 PT 12.8, UA
   with small blood, nit, leuk negative without signif pyuria/bacteruria.
   She was persistently hypotensive, requiring continued ionotropic
   support, switched from dopa to levo. Transthoracic echo in ER showed
   severe MR with good left ventricular function, no evidence of
   vegetations or abscess. Pt was routed to cath lab for emergent
   catheterization and balloon pump placement along with swan placement.
   .
   Further history could not be obtained at time of admission as patient
   intubated and sedated.
   .
   Review of records show:
   1.  ECHO ([**2168-10-5**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.  The left
   ventricular cavity does not appear to be dilated.  Systolic function is
   normal.  The aortic valve (3 leaflets) is normal.  The mitral leaflets
   are diffusely thickened, the posterior leaflet is markedly elongated
   and deformed, and bileaflet prolapse is present.  There is moderate to
   severe mitral regurgitation. The atrial septum is aneurysmal.  No
   shunting across the atrial septum is identified (does not exclude). 2.
   ECHO ([**2169-12-27**]):   Mildly dilated left atrium, otherwise normal cardiac
   chamber sizes. Hyperdynamic left ventricular and right ventricular
   function. Normal aortic valve without aortic insufficiency.  Mildly
   thickened mitral valve with bileaflet late systolic prolapse.
   Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation.  Aneurysmal atrial septum without
   evidence of shunt. Compared with the previous study of 11/95, there has
   been no change.
   .
   3.  ECHO ([**2174-1-20**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
   are normal. Right ventricular chamber size and systolic function
   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitaton.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse with probable partial flail
   leaflet. At least moderate to severe mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared to the prior study of [**2169-12-27**], there is no significant
   change.  4.  Holter ([**2174-1-19**]):   1. Sinus rhythm with intermittent
   minimal PR prolongation. 2. Frequent isolated VPBs, occasional-frequent
   ventricular couplets, and 12 ventricular triplets,
   without prolonged or symptomatic VT.  VEA most prevalent during
   waking hours of 8:30 am-11:00 pm, least during sleep hours.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of severe mitral valve prolapse and hypercholesterolemia. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea and orthopnea, which worsened over three weeks. The initial chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusions. She was desaturated to 89% and received IV lasix without improvement. She was placed on 100% non-rebreather and later intubated due to increased work of breathing.

The patient's blood culture was negative for endocarditis, and a transthoracic echo showed severe mitral regurgitation with good left ventricular function. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and balloon pump placement, along with a swan catheter placement.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with hypotension requiring continued ionotropic support. She has been sedated and intubated, with intermittent hypoxia and respiratory distress. Her ABG showed a pH of 7.41, pCO2 of 37, HCO3 of 24, PO2 of 160, and SaO2 of 100%.

The patient's EKG showed a sinus rhythm with LBBB, and her echocardiogram revealed a mildly dilated left atrium, normal-sized left ventricle, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. There were no vegetations or abscesses identified.

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of severe mitral valve prolapse and hypercholesterolemia who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, non-productive cough, and low-grade fever. She was found to have bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusions on chest X-ray and left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG. Her arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was initially 89%, which improved to 93% with non-rebreather oxygen but eventually required intubation due to increased work of breathing. The patient was diagnosed with cardiogenic shock secondary to acute mitral valve regurgitation (MR). The etiology of acute MR could be endocarditis given her symptoms suggestive of upper respiratory infection (URI) prior to presentation or ischemic damage due to new LBBB.

The patient underwent several interventions, including placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and surveillance blood cultures. She also underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for endocarditis and check rheumatoid factor levels. Coronary angiography revealed clean coronaries with no evidence of ischemia, indicating a non-ischemic etiology of acute MR.

The patient's hemodynamics showed elevated filling pressures with wide-open mitral regurgitation on left ventriculography,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of moderate to severe mitral valve prolapse and probable partial flail leaflet on echocardiogram. She presented in cardiogenic shock secondary to acute mitral valve regurgitation. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been placed, and the patient is planned for surgery on Monday. The patient's coronary arteries are clean, indicating a non-ischemic cause for the acute MR. The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress likely due to acute congestive heart failure in the setting of acute MR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute on chronic mitral valve regurgitation: This condition can lead to heart failure and cardiogenic shock if left untreated.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hemodynamics at the time of catheterization showed elevated filling pressures and a high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, indicating right heart failure or left heart failure.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema, which can occur due to fluid overload or acute heart failure.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and currently has an oxygen saturation in the 70s, indicating severe respiratory compromise.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to a septic response or stress response.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The"

","The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a chief complaint of unknown origin fever. The patient's medical history is significant for severe 4+ mitral regurgitation, partial posterior mitral leaflet flail, and a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with a moderate left-to-right shunt. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 103/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fever. On physical examination, the patient's peripheral vascular pulses were not assessed, and there were no abnormalities noted in the skin or neurologic assessment.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 30.7%, platelet count (Plt) at 258 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 0.6 mg/dL, troponin-T at <0.01 ng/mL, blood glucose at 129 mg/dL, and lactic acid at 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab values were within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), pantoprazole (Protonix), and TF's. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation in assist mode.

The patient's assessment and plan include fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU for further management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of moderate to severe mitral valve prolapse, presenting in cardiogenic shock secondary to acute mitral valve regurgitation. The acute MR could be due to infective endocarditis given symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection prior to presentation. Other possibilities include ischemic etiology or worsening of MVP. No history of trauma is reported.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 103/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.6, slightly elevated troponin-T level, and normal creatinine and glucose levels. Imaging studies reveal moderate mitral valve prolapse with partial flail leaflet and severe mitral regurgitation. A coronary angiogram showed clean coronaries, indicating a non-ischemic etiology of the acute MR.

Plan:
The patient is currently being managed with intravenous fluids, heparin, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She will undergo mitral valve replacement surgery on Monday. Antibiotics have been discontinued as there is no evidence of endocarditis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of moderate-to-severe mitral valve prolapse, presenting in cardiogenic shock secondary to acute mitral valve regurgitation. Acute MR could be due to infective endocarditis, ischemic damage, or worsening of MVP. The patient has been started on antibiotics given concern for endocarditis. Coronary catheterization showed elevated filling pressures with wide-open mitral regurgitation on left ventriculography, indicating a non-ischemic etiology of acute MR. The patient has been weaned off levophed with MAPS above 60 with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. Plan for surgical repair of mitral valve (MVR) on Monday. The patient also has respiratory distress likely due to acute congestive heart failure in the setting of acute MR. She is intubated currently with an oxygen saturation in the 70s. The patient has been on various medications including heparin, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infective endocarditis: The patient's symptoms, including fever and leukocytosis, along with the presence of a prosthetic valve, make infective endocarditis a possibility. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection, such as positive blood cultures or new heart murmurs, is essential.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of moderate to severe mitral valve prolapse and probable partial flail leaflet, presenting in cardiogenic shock secondary to acute mitral valve regurgitation. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.3°F (38.5°C), hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 82/42 mmHg to 103/57 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate between 79-94 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's echocardiogram revealed severe mitral regurgitation, a patent foramen ovale (PFO), and no evidence of endocarditis. She is currently on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, diuretics for pulmonary edema, and systemic anticoagulation with heparin. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 1.0 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T levels at 56. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute worsening of mitral valve regurgitation: The patient's mitral valve regurgitation appears to be severe, and further deterioration could"

The Hct has been trending down, and the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) with 40 mg IV Lasix. The patient experienced hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55 following the administration of IV Lasix, but the hypotension resolved with an increased rate of blood transfusion.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given at 08:30 AM. The patient is currently on several infusions including midazolam (versed), heparin sodium, and fentanyl. Pantoprazole (Protonix) was administered at 08:15 AM, and the fentanyl infusion was changed at 02:38 PM. Furosemide (Lasix) was given at 06:59 PM, and the heparin sodium infusion was changed at 10:17 PM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The flow sheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's maximum temperature recorded was 37.7 degrees Celsius, and the current temperature is 37.3 degrees Celsius. The patient's heart rate is within normal range,"

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   57 y/o woman with hx moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse with
   probable partial flail leaflet on Echo [**2173**], lost to follow up, who now
   presents in cardiogenic shock secondary to acute Mitral valve
   regurgitation.
   #. Acute worsening of mitral valve regurgitation: Likely related to
   natural progression of the patient
s valvular disease. IABP in place.
   Echo showed partial posterior mitral leaflet flail, severe mitral
   regurgitation, and a patent PFO. No evidence for endocarditis on TEE.
   - continue IABP
   - plan for OR Monday
   - f/u OSH blood cx
   # Cardiogenic Shock: CXR showing pulmonary edema. Weaned off levophed
   with MAPS above 60 with IABP. Pt remains intubated.
   - will continue diuresis with IV lasix.
   - continue IABP until sx
   - continue intubation until sx
   .
   #Leukocytosis: likely a stress response [**12-31**] acute process
   - trend fever and WBC and curves
   - f/u culture data (including OSH data)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse who presented in cardiogenic shock secondary to acute mitral valve regurgitation. The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and moderate/severe mitral regurgitation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the progress note include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: This is already present in the patient, which is a life-threatening condition where the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and they require mechanical ventilation. This indicates severe impairment of oxygenation or ventilation.

3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): FUO refers to an unexplained persistent fever. If left untreated, it can lead to various complications, including sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

4. Mitral regurgitation: Severe mitral regurgitation can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention. If not managed appropriately, it can progress to heart failure and other cardiac complications.

5. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. It is important to monitor for any signs of progression or worsening infection.

6. Pulmonary edema: The presence of pulmonary edema, as indicated by"
