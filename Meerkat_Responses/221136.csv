   Assessment and Plan: 58yo M with APML on ATRA, immunocompromised with
   WBC 1.5 with 7 days of fevers and chills despite broad coverage
   antimicrobial therapy. With likely brain abscesses, pneumonia, and
   thigh abscess.
   1. Fevers:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] has several days of spiking fevers and chills. He has been
   neutropenic and continues to have a low absolute neutrophil count and
   underlying APML concerning for an immunocompromised immune system. He
   has been on broad spectrum antibiotics as well as fungal and viral
   coverage. What infectious organisms may be present remains unclear. A
   single blood culture showed Strep viridans, which could be a
   contamanent. Otherwise BCx have been negative though this is not
   unexpected given his broad spectrum coverage. CSF and urine have been
   negative. TEE has been negative. Thigh abscess shows staph. Head CT is
   suggestive for mycotic aneurysms. Chest CT shows multiple foci of
   consolidation concerning for pneumonia. He may therefore have multiple
   simultaneous infections, or he may have a seed of infection with
   hematologic spread to brain and lung. An alternative possibility for
   his fevers includes retinoic acid syndrome give ATRA treatment, however
   it would be unusual timing and should only be considered if infectious
   etiology is ruled out.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate surgery following for thigh abscess
   -Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vanc and meropenem.
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -Consider cefepime for improved coverage of nocardia.

   2. Hypotension:
   He now has been tachycardic with SBPs in the 90s-100s. He has had good
   end organ perfusion with clear mental status and adequate urine output.
   While he is likely infected he does not appear to be septic. He is not
   significantly volume overloaded on exam.
   -Continue fluid boluses as needed to maintain UO
   -Trend Lactic acid to assess prefusion
   -No indication for pressors currently, but will follow closely.
   #. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct has been decreasing and has had limited increase with
   transfusions. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he is guiac
   negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. He may have low level hemolysis though
   we cannot assess given his recent transfusions.
   -Serial Hcts
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 0.8 and now 1.0. There is a broad differential for his acute
   renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would be prerenal
   secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced nephropathy.
   -Urine lytes
   -IVF as above
   -Trend creatinine. If continue to increase start more extensive workup
   for glomerular etiology.
   #. SVT
 Developed an acute onset narrow complex SVT that was
   irregularly irregular. The EKG was difficult to interpret due to a poor
   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with 5mg IV metoprolol.
   -Follow
   -Consider standing metoprolol if afib with tachycardia is persistent.
   #. Dyspnea:
   The patient has 1 week of worsening dyspnea and an increase A-a
   gradient consistent with V/Q mismatch. This is due to the
   consolidations seen on Chest CT, likely pneumonia.
   -Continue supplemental O2
   -Antibiotic therapy as above.
   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC
   -Continue ATRA
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment, who presents with multiple comorbidities including brain abscesses, pneumonia, and thigh abscess. He has been febrile for several days despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 111/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 78% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals moist membranes with sublingual pooling, decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities with 2+ pulses, decreased lower extremity edema, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers and chills despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. This could indicate a possible infectious etiology, potentially due to multiple simultaneous infections or hematologic spread to the brain and lungs. Alternative possibilities include retinoic acid syndrome, but this should be ruled out first.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 90s-100s. Although he appears to have good end-organ perfusion, further monitoring and fluid boluses may be necessary to maintain adequate urine output. There is no"

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo M with APML on ATRA, immunocompromised with
   WBC 1.5 with 7 days of fevers and chills despite broad coverage
   antimicrobial therapy. With likely brain abscesses, pneumonia, and
   thigh abscess.
   1. Fevers:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] has several days of spiking fevers and chills. He has been
   neutropenic and continues to have a low absolute neutrophil count and
   underlying APML concerning for an immunocompromised immune system. He
   has been on broad spectrum antibiotics as well as fungal and viral
   coverage. What infectious organisms may be present remains unclear. A
   single blood culture showed Strep viridans, which could be a
   contamanent. Otherwise BCx have been negative though this is not
   unexpected given his broad spectrum coverage. CSF and urine have been
   negative. TEE has been negative. Thigh abscess shows staph. Head CT is
   suggestive for mycotic aneurysms. Chest CT shows multiple foci of
   consolidation concerning for pneumonia. He may therefore have multiple
   simultaneous infections, or he may have a seed of infection with
   hematologic spread to brain and lung. An alternative possibility for
   his fevers includes retinoic acid syndrome give ATRA treatment, however
   it would be unusual timing and should only be considered if infectious
   etiology is ruled out.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate surgery following for thigh abscess
   -Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vanc and meropenem.
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -Consider cefepime for improved coverage of nocardia.
   -Bronchoscopy for culture in am (also AFB, fungal cx, nocardia)
   -f/u betaglucan, galactomannan
   -f/u Legionella urinary antigen
   -f/u Histo antigen
   -f/u Cryptococcus antigen
   -f/u Toxo antigen
   -Respiratory viral panel
   2. Hypotension:
   He now has been tachycardic with SBPs in the 90s-100s. He has had good
   end organ perfusion with clear mental status and adequate urine output.
   While he is likely infected he does not appear to be septic. He is not
   significantly volume overloaded on exam.
   -Continue fluid boluses as needed to maintain UO
   -Trend Lactic acid to assess prefusion
   -No indication for pressors currently, but will follow closely.
   #. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct has been decreasing and has had limited increase with
   transfusions. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he is guiac
   negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. He may have low level hemolysis though
   we cannot assess given his recent transfusions.
   -Serial Hcts
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 0.8 and now 1.0. There is a broad differential for his acute
   renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would be prerenal
   secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced nephropathy.
   -Urine lytes
   -IVF as above
   -Trend creatinine. If continue to increase start more extensive workup
   for glomerular etiology.
   #. SVT
 Developed an acute onset narrow complex SVT that was
   irregularly irregular. The EKG was difficult to interpret due to a poor
   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with 5mg IV metoprolol.
   -Follow
   -Consider standing metoprolol if afib with tachycardia is persistent.
   #. Dyspnea:
   The patient has 1 week of worsening dyspnea and an increase A-a
   gradient consistent with V/Q mismatch. This is due to the
   consolidations seen on Chest CT, likely pneumonia.
   -Continue supplemental O2
   -Antibiotic therapy as above.
   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC
   -Continue ATRA
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy, who is immunocompromised and has been experiencing fevers and chills for several days. He has a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The patient's blood culture showed Strep viridans, which may be a contaminant. Other cultures are negative, including CSF and urine. Imaging studies suggest possible brain abscesses, thigh abscess, mycotic aneurysms, and multiple foci of consolidation in the lungs, consistent with pneumonia. The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, but he has good end-organ perfusion. He is anemic due to APML and chemotherapy. The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating possible acute kidney injury. He developed an irregularly irregular narrow complex SVT, which was controlled with metoprolol. The patient has been experiencing worsening dyspnea, which is likely due to pneumonia. He has a coagulopathy of unclear etiology, possibly nutritional deficiency. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, and supportive care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has experienced multiple health events during their stay, including a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct) levels, which necessitated two blood transfusions. Despite the transfusions, the patient's Hct remained low at 22%. Additionally, the patient developed narrow complex tachycardia, which was initially managed with Diltiazam and subsequently controlled with Metoprolol. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. They have been receiving various antibiotics, including metronidazole, clindamycin, vancomycin, and meropenem. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) as part of their ICU medication regimen.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F) and a current temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F). Their heart rate is 136 bpm with a range of 85-136 bpm, blood pressure ranges from 111/75 mmHg to 115/78 mmHg, respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute with a range of 20-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 78% on a nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is noted as multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). Fluid balance reveals an intake of 6,970 mL and output of 2,450 mL, resulting in a net balance of 4,520 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to assessment not being conducted.

Lab Results:
The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 259 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 7.7 g/dL, low hematocrit (Hct) at 22.0%, and low platelet count (Plt) at 182. Other lab values include elevated creatinine (Cr) at 1.0 mg/dL, normal glucose at 110 mg/dL, prolonged prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/international normalized ratio (INR) at 18.6/32.7/1.7, and normal liver function tests (ALT/AST). Additionally, the patient has an elevated D-dimer level at 1356 ng/mL, normal fibrinogen at 662 mg/dL, slightly low calcium (Ca++) at 7.7 mg/dL, normal magnesium (Mg++) at 1.9 mg/dL, and normal phosphate (PO4) at 3.7 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with anemia, fever"

   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU has been experiencing several health issues. The main concerns include a low hematocrit (Hct) level, narrow complex tachycardia, allergies to penicillins, and an unknown allergy. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions due to a decreased Hct level, which initially improved but then remained at 22 despite further transfusion. 

The patient also had a narrow complex tachycardia ranging from 140-160 beats per minute, which was concerning for atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). The patient was hemodynamically stable, and Diltiazam and Metoprolol were administered to control the heart rate, with successful reduction to 120 bpm and normalization of sinus rhythm.

The patient's medical history notes allergies to penicillins and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics given were Metronidazole, Clindamycin, Vancomycin, and Meropenem.

The patient is on several medications including pantoprazole, docusate, vitamin K, meperidine, morphine sulfate, acetaminophen, ondansetron, simethicone, prochlorperazine, Diltiazem, and metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F), current temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 136 bpm with a range of 85-136 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/75 mmHg to 115/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute with a range of 20-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 78%. The patient has a history of MAT.

Fluid balance shows an input of 6,970 mL with 480 mL since 12 AM, and output of 2,450 mL with 400 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has received blood products as well.

The patient's blood work shows low white blood cell count (WBC), low hematocrit (Hct), low platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and slightly elevated blood glucose level. Other lab results indicate elevated PT/PTT/INR levels, as well as slightly elevated ALT/AST levels and normal Alk Phos/T Bili levels. The differential reveals a high percentage of neutrophils and low percentages of bands, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. The patient also has an elevated D-dimer level, normal fibrinogen level, lactic acid level, LDH level, calcium level, magnesium level, and phosphate level.

The patient's assessment and plan include anemia, fever of unknown origin (FUO), hypotension, and dyspnea. The patient is in the ICU for close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo M with APML
   1. Fevers:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] has several days of spiking fevers and chills. He has been
   neutropenic and continues to have a low absolute neutrophil count and
   underlying APML concerning for an immunocompromised immune system. He
   has been on broad spectrum antibiotics as well as fungal and viral
   coverage. What infectious organisms may be present remains unclear. A
   single blood culture showed Strep viridans, which could be a
   contamanent. Otherwise BCx have been negative though this is not
   unexpected given his broad spectrum coverage. CSF and urine have been
   negative. TEE has been negative. Thigh abscess shows gram+ cocci in
   pairs/clusters. Head CT is suggestive for mycotic aneurysms. Chest CT
   shows multiple foci of consolidation concerning for pneumonia. He may
   therefore have multiple simultaneous infections, or he may have a seed
   of infection with hematologic spread to brain and lung. An alternative
   possibility for his fevers includes retinoic acid syndrome give ATRA
   treatment, however it would be unusual timing and should only be
   considered if infectious etiology is ruled out.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate surgery following for thigh abscess
   -Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vanc and meropenem.
   -Discontinue clindamycin (no evidence of necrotizing faciitis), and
   flagyl (low concern for anaerobes).
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -Consider cefepime for improved coverage of nocardia.
   -Bronchoscopy for culture in am (also AFB, fungal cx, nocardia)
   -betaglucan, galactomannan pending
   -Legionella urinary antigen
   -Histo antigen/antibody
   -Cryptococcus antigen
   -Toxo antigen
   2. Hypotension:
   He now has SIRS physiology and hypotension with several likely sources
   of infection. While brain abscess does not usually lead to sepsis. This
   is all concerning for new septic physiology. He has been fluid
   responsive thus far and clinically is maintaining adequate pressure for
   perfusion. His

   -No indication for pressors currently, but will follow closely.
   3. Dyspnea:
   The patient has 1 week of worsening dyspnea and an increase A-a
   gradient consistent with V/Q mismatch. This is due to the
   consolidations seen on Chest CT, likely pneumonia.
   -Continue supplemental O2
   -Antibiotic therapy as above.
   3. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC
   -Continue ATRA
   4. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo with APML on ATRA with pulmonary infiltrates,
   intraparenchymal CNS lesions, thigh abscess. In the ICU for fevers and
   hypotension.
   1. Pulmonary infiltrates:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] remains tachypnic with an oxygen requirement, but is stable
   and feels his breathing is improving. He has had only 1 low grade fever
   over the past 48 hours. A bronchoscopy did not identify organisms with
   a negative gram stain and cultures pending. The differential still
   includes infectious pneumonia versus retinoic acid syndorme. Pneumonia
   seems more likely given his immunocompromised state and presentation.
   RA syndrome is less likely given his clinical presentation and lack of
   other findings of this syndrome.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate oncology following
   -Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vanc and meropenem.
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -f/u bronchoscopy results
   -f/u betaglucan
   -f/u Histo antigen
   -f/u Toxo antigen
   -Review chest imaging with radiology
   -Consider diuresis after hemodynamic stabilization and improved renal
   function
   -Discuss steroids and considering stopping ATRA with oncology team
   #.CNS lesions:
   Likely abscess. Stable on past imaging. No change in neurologic exam or
   mental status. Will need repeat head CT in the next several days.
   #. Thigh abscess:
   Coag + staph, improving with vanc and meropenem.
   -Continue ab converage as above.
   #. Fevers:
   The source of his fevers could include any of the above problems,
   including infections or ATRA syndrome. BCx from the past 6 days have
   remained negative. His last high grade fever was greater than 48 hours
   ago. He had a low grade temperature to 101 today. Continue coverage as
   above.
   #. Hypotension:
   He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension with SBP in the 90s and
   concern for sepsis. He was asymptomatic. He has responded well to fluid
   replacement and has not required pressors. He has maintained his
   pressures since admission. His lactate has retunred to normal and he
   does not have septic physiology.
   -Encourage good PO intake and follow closely.
   -IVF bolus as necessary for any hypotension.
   5. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct has been decreasing and has had limited increase with
   transfusions. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he is guiac
   negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. He may have low level hemolysis though
   we cannot assess given his recent transfusions. He may have had some
   pulmonary hemorrhage giving the rapid resolution of the consolidation
   seen on CT, though the lavage did not show any blood.
   -Serial Hcts
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 1.0 and decreased to 0.9 today. There is a broad differential
   for his acute renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would
   be prerenal secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced
   nephropathy. His FENA is <1 also consistent with these two
   possiblities.
   -Trend creatinine. If continues to increase start more extensive workup
   for glomerular etiology.
   #. Proteinuria
 Spot Prot/Cr = 1.2. The most likely causes is a
   functional proteinuria given his multiple likely infections, though
   this could also be related to his [**Last Name (un) **] if he has a new glomerular
   pathology. A urine sediment will be useful for an initial workup.
   -UA, sediment, and culture.
   #. SVT
 Developed an acute onset narrow complex SVT that was
   irregularly irregular. The EKG was difficult to interpret due to a poor
   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with metoprolol.
   -Continue metoprolol.
   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC with diff
   -Continue ATRA, though consider trial of steroids or holding ATRA in
   the future if pulm status does not improve
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.

   Critical Care
   Breathing slightly improved overnight and he slept.  Oxygenation
   stable, but CXR somewhat worse and now suggests primarily volume
   overload.  Febrile this am. WBC sl down over last 2 days but plts up.
   Still seems likely he has some infectious pneumonia but neg BAL and
   appearance of CXR this am do raise possibility of fluid as cause of
   infiltrates although the appearance would certainly be atypical.
   We will try to maintain I&O even to sl negative if possible.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. He is currently in the ICU for fevers and hypotension. The patient has pulmonary infiltrates, intraparenchymal CNS lesions (likely abscess), and a thigh abscess. His recent events include a bronchoscopy, multiple blood cultures, and various lab tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient remains tachypnic with an oxygen requirement, but stable and feels his breathing is improving. The differential includes infectious pneumonia versus retinoic acid syndrome (RA syndrome). Pneumonia seems more likely given the immunocompromised state and presentation. The patient will continue broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin and meropenem, as well as Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.

2. CNS lesions: Likely abscess. The patient is stable on past imaging with no change in neurologic exam or mental status. A repeat head CT will be done in the next several days.

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo with APML on ATRA with pulmonary infiltrates,

   hypotension.
   1. Pulmonary infiltrates:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] remains tachypnic with an oxygen requirement, but is stable
   and feels his breathing is improving. He has had only 1 low grade fever
   over the past 48 hours. A bronchoscopy did not identify organisms with
   a negative gram stain and cultures pending. The differential still
   includes infectious pneumonia versus retinoic acid syndorme. Pneumonia
   seems highly likely given his immunocompromised state and presentation.
   RA syndrome is unlike given his time
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate surgery following for thigh abscess
   -Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vanc and meropenem.

   -f/u Legionella urinary antigen
   -f/u Histo antigen
   -f/u Cryptococcus antigen
   -f/u Toxo antigen
   -Respiratory viral panel
   2. Hypotension:
   He now has been tachycardic with SBPs in the 90s-100s. He has had good
   end organ perfusion with clear mental status and adequate urine output.
   While he is likely infected he does not appear to be septic. He is not
   significantly volume overloaded on exam.
   -Continue fluid boluses as needed to maintain UO
   -Trend Lactic acid to assess prefusion
   -No indication for pressors currently, but will follow closely.
   #. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct has been decreasing and has had limited increase with
   transfusions. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he is guiac
   negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. He may have low level hemolysis though
   we cannot assess given his recent transfusions.
   -Serial Hcts
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 0.8 and now 1.0. There is a broad differential for his acute
   renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would be prerenal
   secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced nephropathy.
   -Urine lytes
   -IVF as above
   -Trend creatinine. If continue to increase start more extensive workup
   for glomerular etiology.
   #. SVT
 Developed an acute onset narrow complex SVT that was
   irregularly irregular. The EKG was difficult to interpret due to a poor
   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with 5mg IV metoprolol.
   -Follow
   -Consider standing metoprolol if afib with tachycardia is persistent.
   #. Dyspnea:
   The patient has 1 week of worsening dyspnea and an increase A-a
   gradient consistent with V/Q mismatch. This is due to the
   consolidations seen on Chest CT, likely pneumonia.
   -Continue supplemental O2
   -Antibiotic therapy as above.
   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC
   -Continue ATRA
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.

   unexpected given his broad spectrum coverage. CSF and urine have been
   negative. TEE has been negative. Thigh abscess shows staph. Head CT is
   suggestive for mycotic aneurysms. Chest CT shows multiple foci of

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo M with APML on ATRA, immunocompromised with
   WBC 1.5 with 7 days of fevers and chills despite broad coverage
   antimicrobial therapy. With likely brain abscesses, pneumonia, and
   thigh abscess.
   1. Fevers:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] has several days of spiking fevers and chills. He has been
   neutropenic and continues to have a low absolute neutrophil count and
   underlying APML concerning for an immunocompromised immune system. He
   has been on broad spectrum antibiotics as well as fungal and viral
   coverage. What infectious organisms may be present remains unclear. A
   single blood culture showed Strep viridans, which could be a
   contamanent. Otherwise BCx have been negative though this is not
   unexpected given his broad spectrum coverage. CSF and urine have been
   negative. TEE has been negative. Thigh abscess shows staph. Head CT is
   suggestive for mycotic aneurysms. Chest CT shows multiple foci of
   consolidation concerning for pneumonia. He may therefore have multiple
   simultaneous infections, or he may have a seed of infection with
   hematologic spread to brain and lung. An alternative possibility for
   his fevers includes retinoic acid syndrome give ATRA treatment, however
   it would be unusual timing and should only be considered if infectious
   etiology is ruled out.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate surgery following for thigh abscess
   -Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vanc and meropenem.
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -Consider cefepime for improved coverage of nocardia.
   -f/u betaglucan, galactomannan
   -f/u Legionella urinary antigen
   -f/u Histo antigen
   -f/u Cryptococcus antigen
   -f/u Toxo antigen
   -Respiratory viral panel
   2. Hypotension (Not shock):
   He now has been tachycardic with SBPs in the 90s-100s. He has had good
   end organ perfusion with clear mental status and adequate urine output.
   While he is likely infected he does not appear to be septic. He is not
   significantly volume overloaded on exam.
   -Continue fluid boluses as needed to maintain UO
   -Trend Lactic acid to assess prefusion
   -No indication for pressors currently, but will follow closely.
   #. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct has been decreasing and has had limited increase with
   transfusions. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he is guiac
   negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. He may have low level hemolysis though
   we cannot assess given his recent transfusions.
   -Serial Hcts
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 0.8 and now 1.0. There is a broad differential for his acute
   renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would be prerenal
   secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced nephropathy.
   -Urine lytes
   -IVF as above
   -Trend creatinine. If continue to increase start more extensive workup
   for glomerular etiology.
   #. SVT
 Developed an acute onset narrow complex SVT that was
   irregularly irregular. The EKG was difficult to interpret due to a poor
   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with 5mg IV metoprolol.
   -Follow
   -Consider standing metoprolol if afib with tachycardia is persistent.
   #. Dyspnea:
   The patient has 1 week of worsening dyspnea and an increase A-a
   gradient consistent with V/Q mismatch. This is due to the
   consolidations seen on Chest CT, likely pneumonia.
   -Continue supplemental O2
   -Antibiotic therapy as above.
   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC
   -Continue ATRA
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is immunocompromised. The patient has been experiencing fevers and chills for several days despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, suggesting a potential infectious cause. The patient also has a low absolute neutrophil count, which increases the risk of infections. The presence of multiple infections or hematologic spread of infection to the brain and lungs is suspected. The patient's thigh abscess shows Staphylococcus infection, and a head CT suggests mycotic aneurysms. The chest CT indicates multiple foci of consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 

The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, but good end-organ perfusion is maintained with clear mental status and adequate urine output. The patient's anemia is attributed to APML and chemotherapy. Acute kidney injury may be secondary to prerenal volume depletion or contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient developed a narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia, which resolved with IV metoprolol. The patient's dyspnea is likely due to pneumonia. 

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, as well as antifungal and antiviral coverage. Additional tests and treatments are being considered to rule out various infectious agents and manage the patient's conditions effectively."

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo with APML on ATRA with pulmonary infiltrates,
   intraparenchymal CNS lesions, thigh abscess. In the ICU for fevers and
   hypotension.
   1. Pulmonary infiltrates:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] remains tachypnic with an oxygen requirement, but is stable
   and feels his breathing is improving. His respiratory rate has
   decreased significantly. His last elevated temperature was 24 hours ago
   to 101, and he has had no high grade fevers for over 72 hours.
   Bronchoscopy has shown no organisms to date, though fungal and nocardia
   cultures remain pending. The differential still includes infectious
   pneumonia, retinoic acid syndrome, and pulmonary edema both cardiogenic
   and non cardiogenic. Pneumonia seems most likely given his
   immunocompromised state and presentation, though it is likely there is
   an element of pulmonary edema as well given his diffuse interstitial
   pattern on CXR. He fever curve is improving on broad spectrum
   antibiotics and his CXR is improving as his urine output increases.
   Retinoic acid syndrome is less likely given his clinical presentation
   and lack of other findings of this syndrome.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate oncology following
   -Continue meropenem
   -Consider discontinuing vancomycin
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -f/u bronchoscopy results
   -f/u betaglucan
   -f/u Histo antigen
   -Consider diuresis after hemodynamic stabilization and improved renal
   function
   #.CNS lesions:
   Likely abscess. Stable on past imaging. No change in neurologic exam or
   mental status.
   -Repeat head CT [**4-24**]
   #. Thigh abscess:
   MSSA, improving with vanc and meropenem.
   -Continue meropenem
   -Repeat thigh US
   -Consider d/c vancomycin
   #. Fevers:
   The source of his fevers could include any of the above problems,
   including infections or ATRA syndrome. BCx from the past 6 days have
   remained negative. His last high grade fever was greater than 72 hours
   ago. Continue antibiotic coverage as above.
   #. Hypotension:
   He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension with SBP in the 90s and
   concern for sepsis. He was asymptomatic. He has responded well to fluid
   replacement and has not required pressors. He has maintained his
   pressures since admission. His lactate has retunred to normal and he
   does not have septic physiology.
   -Encourage good PO intake and follow closely.
   -IVF bolus as necessary for any hypotension.
   5. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct has been decreasing and has had limited increase with
   transfusions. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he is guiac
   negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. He may have low level hemolysis though
   we cannot assess given his recent transfusions. He may have had some
   pulmonary hemorrhage giving the rapid resolution of the consolidation
   seen on CT, though the lavage did not show any blood.
   -Serial Hcts
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 1.0 and decreased to 0.9 today. There is a broad differential
   for his acute renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would
   be prerenal secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced
   nephropathy. His FENA is <1 also consistent with these two
   possiblities.
   -Trend creatinine. If continues to increase start more extensive workup
   for glomerular etiology.
   #. Proteinuria
 Spot Prot/Cr = 1.2. The most likely causes is a
   functional proteinuria given his multiple likely infections, though
   this could also be related to his [**Last Name (un) **] if he has a new glomerular
   pathology. A urine sediment will be useful for an initial workup.
   -UA, sediment, and culture.
   #. SVT
 Developed an acute onset narrow complex SVT that was
   irregularly irregular. The EKG was difficult to interpret due to a poor
   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with metoprolol.
   -Continue metoprolol.
   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC with diff
   -Continue ATRA, though consider trial of steroids or holding ATRA in
   the future if pulm status does not improve
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.
   -Continue vitamin K

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo with APML on ATRA with pulmonary infiltrates,
   intraparenchymal CNS lesions, thigh abscess. In the ICU for fevers and
   hypotension.
   1. Pulmonary infiltrates:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] remains tachypnic with an oxygen requirement, but is stable
   and feels his breathing is improving. His respiratory rate has
   decreased significantly. His last elevated temperature was 24 hours ago
   to 101, and he has had no high grade fevers for over 72 hours.
   Bronchoscopy has shown no organisms to date, though fungal and nocardia
   cultures remain pending. His CXR today shows worsening pulmonary edema.
   The differential still includes infectious pneumonia, retinoic acid
   syndrome, and pulmonary edema both cardiogenic and non cardiogenic.
   Pneumonia seems likely given his immunocompromised state and
   presentation. There is likely an element of pulmonary edema as well
   given his diffuse interstitial pattern on CXR. His worsening pulmonary
   edema may be due to volume overload and a trial of diuresis is
   warranted. Retinoic acid syndrome is less likely given his clinical
   presentation and lack of other findings of this syndrome. Finally his
   Toxo IgG is positive and IgM negative. He could have disseminated Toxo
   to his CNS and lungs. This may simply represent old infection, however
   given his immunocompromised state, he may be infected and unable to
   mount an IgM response.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate oncology following
   -Diuresis with goal negative 1.5-2L
   -Continue antibiotic coverage as discussed below (see leucopenia)
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -Consider coverage for Toxo with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.
   -f/u bronchoscopy cultures
   -f/u Histo antigen
   #. Leukopenia: Oncology feels this is too late to be secondary to
   chemotherapy, and there is no evidence of tumor recurrence leading to
   leukopenia. He likely has marrow suppression. This could be due to a
   drug side effect, most likely from an antimicrobial. Vancomycin is
   known to cause marrow suppression after several days of use. Meropenem
   can also cause marrow suppression those typically presents with anemia.
   -Discuss with ID and Onc change of antibiotics. Would favor changing
   meropenem to cefepime and consideration of discontinuing vancomycin
   given no known MRSA.
   #.CNS lesions:
   Likely abscess. Stable on past imaging. No change in neurologic exam or
   mental status. Will need repeat CT, however plan to wait given need for
   diuresis and elevated creatinine at present.
   #. Thigh abscess:
   MSSA, improving with vanc and meropenem.
   -Antibiotic coverage as above
   #. Fevers:
   The source of his fevers could include any of the above problems,
   including infections or ATRA syndrome. BCx from the past 6 days have
   remained negative. His last high grade fever was greater than 72 hours
   ago. Continue antibiotic coverage as above.
   #. Hypotension:
   He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension with SBP in the 90s and
   concern for sepsis. He was asymptomatic. He has responded well to fluid
   replacement and has not required pressors. He has maintained his
   pressures since admission. His lactate has returned to [**Location 810**] and he
   does not have septic physiology.
   -Careful diuresis as above
   5. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct is now stable. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he
   is guiac negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. Continue to follow Hct.
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 1.0 and decreased to 0.9 today. There is a broad differential
   for his acute renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would
   be prerenal secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced

   functional proteinuria given his multiple likely infections, though
   this could also be related to his [**Last Name (un) **] if he has a new glomerular
   pathology. A urine sediment will be useful for an initial workup.
   -UA, sediment, and culture.

   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with metoprolol.

   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC with diff
   -Continue ATRA
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo with APML on ATRA with pulmonary infiltrates,
   intraparenchymal CNS lesions, thigh abscess. In the ICU for fevers and
   hypotension.
   1. Pulmonary infiltrates:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] remains tachypnic with an oxygen requirement, but is stable
   and feels his breathing is improving. His respiratory rate has
   decreased significantly. His last elevated temperature was 24 hours ago
   to 101, and he has had no high grade fevers for over 72 hours.
   Bronchoscopy has shown no organisms to date, though fungal and nocardia
   cultures remain pending. His CXR today shows worsening pulmonary edema.
   The differential still includes infectious pneumonia, retinoic acid
   syndrome, and pulmonary edema both cardiogenic and non cardiogenic.
   Pneumonia seems likely given his immunocompromised state and
   presentation. There is likely an element of pulmonary edema as well
   given his diffuse interstitial pattern on CXR. His worsening pulmonary
   edema may be due to volume overload and a trial of diuresis is
   warranted. Retinoic acid syndrome is less likely given his clinical
   presentation and lack of other findings of this syndrome. Finally his
   Toxo IgG is positive and IgM negative. He could have disseminated Toxo
   to his CNS and lungs. This may simply represent old infection, however
   given his immunocompromised state, he may be infected and unable to
   mount an IgM response.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate oncology following
   -Diuresis with goal negative 1.5-2L
   -Continue antibiotic coverage as discussed below (see leucopenia)
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -Consider coverage for Toxo with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.
   -f/u bronchoscopy cultures
   -f/u Histo antigen
   #. Leukopenia: Oncology feels this is too late to be secondary to
   chemotherapy, and there is no evidence of tumor recurrence leading to
   leukopenia. He likely has marrow suppression. This could be due to a
   drug side effect, most likely from an antimicrobial. Vancomycin is
   known to cause marrow suppression after several days of use. Meropenem
   can also cause marrow suppression those typically presents with anemia.
   -Discuss with ID and Onc change of antibiotics. Would favor changing
   meropenem to cefepime and consideration of discontinuing vancomycin
   given no known MRSA.
   #.CNS lesions:
   Likely abscess. Stable on past imaging. No change in neurologic exam or
   mental status. Will need repeat CT, however plan to wait given need for
   diuresis and elevated creatinine at present.
   #. Thigh abscess:
   MSSA, improving with vanc and meropenem.
   -Antibiotic coverage as above
   #. Fevers:
   The source of his fevers could include any of the above problems,
   including infections or ATRA syndrome. BCx from the past 6 days have
   remained negative. His last high grade fever was greater than 72 hours
   ago. Continue antibiotic coverage as above.
   #. Hypotension:
   He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension with SBP in the 90s and
   concern for sepsis. He was asymptomatic. He has responded well to fluid
   replacement and has not required pressors. He has maintained his
   pressures since admission. His lactate has returned to [**Location 810**] and he
   does not have septic physiology.
   -Careful diuresis as above
   5. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct is now stable. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he
   is guiac negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. Continue to follow Hct.
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 1.0 and decreased to 0.9 today. There is a broad differential
   for his acute renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would
   be prerenal secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced
   nephropathy. His FENA is <1 also consistent with these two
   possiblities.
   -Trend creatinine. If continues to increase start more extensive workup
   for glomerular etiology.
   #. Proteinuria
 Spot Prot/Cr = 1.2. The most likely causes is a
   functional proteinuria given his multiple likely infections, though
   this could also be related to his [**Last Name (un) **] if he has a new glomerular
   pathology. A urine sediment will be useful for an initial workup.
   -UA, sediment, and culture.
   #. SVT
 Developed an acute onset narrow complex SVT that was
   irregularly irregular. The EKG was difficult to interpret due to a poor
   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with metoprolol.
   -Continue metoprolol.
   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC with diff
   -Continue ATRA
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.
   -Continue vitamin K

   pressures since admission. His lactate has retunred to normal and he
   does not have septic physiology.
   -Encourage good PO intake and follow closely.
   -IVF bolus as necessary for any hypotension.
   5. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct has been decreasing and has had limited increase with
   transfusions. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he is guiac
   negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. He may have low level hemolysis though
   we cannot assess given his recent transfusions. He may have had some
   pulmonary hemorrhage giving the rapid resolution of the consolidation
   seen on CT, though the lavage did not show any blood.

","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), who presented to the ICU with hypotension and concern for sepsis. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, which stabilized his condition. The patient's current condition is stable, with an oxygen requirement but improving breathing. He has had only one low-grade fever over the past 48 hours. A bronchoscopy did not identify any organisms, and cultures are pending.

   Assessment and Plan: 58yo with APML on ATRA with pulmonary infiltrates,
   intraparenchymal CNS lesions, thigh abscess. In the ICU for fevers and
   hypotension.
   1. Pulmonary infiltrates:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6179**] remains tachypnic with an oxygen requirement, but is stable
   and feels his breathing is improving. His respiratory rate has
   decreased significantly. His last elevated temperature was 24 hours ago
   to 101, and he has had no high grade fevers for over 72 hours.
   Bronchoscopy has shown no organisms to date, though fungal and nocardia
   cultures remain pending. His CXR today shows worsening pulmonary edema.
   The differential still includes infectious pneumonia, retinoic acid
   syndrome, and pulmonary edema both cardiogenic and non cardiogenic.
   Pneumonia seems likely given his immunocompromised state and
   presentation. There is likely an element of pulmonary edema as well
   given his diffuse interstitial pattern on CXR. His worsening pulmonary
   edema may be due to volume overload and a trial of diuresis is
   warranted. Retinoic acid syndrome is less likely given his clinical
   presentation and lack of other findings of this syndrome. Finally his
   Toxo IgG is positive and IgM negative. He could have disseminated Toxo
   to his CNS and lungs. This may simply represent old infection, however
   given his immunocompromised state, he may be infected and unable to
   mount an IgM response.
   -Appreciate ID following
   -Appreciate oncology following
   -Diuresis with goal negative 1.5-2L
   -Continue antibiotic coverage as discussed below (see leucopenia)
   -Continue Voriconazole and Acyclovir for fungal/viral coverage.
   -Consider coverage for Toxo with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.
   -f/u bronchoscopy cultures
   -f/u Histo antigen
   #. Leukopenia: Oncology feels this is too late to be secondary to
   chemotherapy, and there is no evidence of tumor recurrence leading to
   leukopenia. He likely has marrow suppression. This could be due to a
   drug side effect, most likely from an antimicrobial. Vancomycin is
   known to cause marrow suppression after several days of use. Meropenem
   can also cause marrow suppression those typically presents with anemia.
   -Discuss with ID and Onc change of antibiotics. Would favor changing
   meropenem to cefepime and consideration of discontinuing vancomycin
   given no known MRSA.
   #.CNS lesions:
   Likely abscess. Stable on past imaging. No change in neurologic exam or
   mental status. Will need repeat CT, however plan to wait given need for
   diuresis and elevated creatinine at present.
   #. Thigh abscess:
   MSSA, improving with vanc and meropenem.
   -Antibiotic coverage as above
   #. Fevers:
   The source of his fevers could include any of the above problems,
   including infections or ATRA syndrome. BCx from the past 6 days have
   remained negative. His last high grade fever was greater than 72 hours
   ago. Continue antibiotic coverage as above.
   #. Hypotension:
   He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension with SBP in the 90s and
   concern for sepsis. He was asymptomatic. He has responded well to fluid
   replacement and has not required pressors. He has maintained his
   pressures since admission. His lactate has returned to [**Location 810**] and he
   does not have septic physiology.
   -Careful diuresis as above
   5. Anemia
 He is anemic at baseline due to his APML and chemotherapy.
   His hct is now stable. There is no clinical indication of bleeding, he
   is guiac negative, DIC labs are negative and he is not hemodynamically
   compromised due to his anemia. Continue to follow Hct.
   #. Acute kidney injury
 Creatinine has increased from a baseline of
   0.5 to 1.0 and decreased to 0.9 today. There is a broad differential
   for his acute renal insufficiency though the most likely causes would
   be prerenal secondary to relative volume depletion or contrast induced
   nephropathy. His FENA is <1 also consistent with these two
   possiblities.
   -Trend creatinine. If continues to increase start more extensive workup
   for glomerular etiology.
   #. Proteinuria
 Spot Prot/Cr = 1.2. The most likely causes is a
   functional proteinuria given his multiple likely infections, though
   this could also be related to his [**Last Name (un) **] if he has a new glomerular
   pathology. A urine sediment will be useful for an initial workup.
   -UA, sediment, and culture.
   #. SVT
 Developed an acute onset narrow complex SVT that was
   irregularly irregular. The EKG was difficult to interpret due to a poor
   baseline but appears consistent with Afib, though MAT or sinus rhythm
   with frequent ectopy is possible. This is likely secondary to his
   pneumonia. He returned to NSR with metoprolol.
   -Continue metoprolol.
   #. APML: s/p induction chemotherapy and now on ATRA per oncology.
   -Appreciate oncology recommendations
   -Trend CBC with diff
   -Continue ATRA
   #. Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology. Present since admission and DIC labs
   have been negative. Most likely nutritional deficiency.
   -Continue vitamin K
