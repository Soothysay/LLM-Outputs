","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HIV on HAART, and status post total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) for fibroids. She was admitted to the ICU for hypertensive urgency, acute respiratory failure not associated with ARDS, and pain control due to acute and chronic pain.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient required non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory depression caused by narcotics and likely obesity-related hypoventilation. She experienced episodes of desaturation in the 80s while sleeping and was placed on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) overnight.

Her blood pressure remained in the 200s despite receiving oral and intravenous medications. She responded well to hydralazine but needed additional medications for blood pressure control. The goal blood pressure range was set at 140-160 mmHg. Lisinopril 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg were continued, and metoprolol was increased to 50 mg. Amlodipine 5 mg was also added.

The patient had serosanguinous drainage from her incision as expected after the TAH. Pain control was managed with dilaudid on an as-needed basis. Foley catheterization was discontinued, and ambulation was encouraged.

Her glucose levels were elevated in the 300s, and NPH insulin was restarted at 20 units qam/pm. The target"

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, HIV on HAART, and previous transabdominal hysterectomy for fibroids. She presented to the ICU with hypertensive urgency and acute respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation. Her current vital signs include a blood pressure of 171/60 mmHg, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm. The patient has been receiving various medications for her conditions including lopressor, hydralazine, labetalol, amlodipine, metoprolol, furosemide, and hydromorphone.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels (243 mg/dL), slightly low white blood cell count (8.7 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (32.0%), normal platelet count (319 K/uL), and elevated creatinine levels (0.7). Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia (Na 127 mEq/L) and hypochloremia (Cl 91 mEq/L). The patient's chest X-ray is clear.

The patient's medical conditions include hypertension, diabetes, HIV, and a history of abdominal surgery. The assessment and plan include pain control, respiratory failure, hypertension, and other ongoing management of her various conditions.

   Patient beginning to auto-diurese. Stop HCTZ given her hyponatremia.
   Autodiuresis should help hyponatremia as long as we don't give
   significant free water; suspect low Na partly due to HCTZ therapy.
   Hct down post-op. Not at transfusion threshold. Doubt significant

   47F with HTN, DM, HIV on HAART, s/p TAH for fibroids, with somnolence
   requiring BiPAP in PACU after receiving analgesics, also hypertensive
   urgency
   # HTN:  Continued to be HTN to 200's requiring po prn po and iv
   medications.  has responded well to hydralizine, but given that it is a
   q6h dosing, need to have her on something less frequent as she will
   likely need to be discharged on this.
   - goal BP's 140-160--goal was 160-170 with first 24 hours, but has
   continued to be in hypertensive urgency, so should still be cautious of
   lower bp too aggressively and cauing cerebral ischemia [**2-19**] to
   autoregulation
   - continue lisinopril40 qd, HCTZ 25 qd
   - metoprolol increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to start today
 would continue to
   increase this consider tid dosing given hr in 90
   - Amlodipine 5mg added to start today
   - had abd CT in [**Month (only) **], no evidence of adrenal mass
   - consider further w/u for secondary HTN if bps do not come down with
   aggressive beta blocker treatment
   - continue iv hydral prn
   # Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: Na 127 and Cl 91 this morning, have been
   low in past.  Likely [**2-19**] to diuretic use.  Patient also autodiuresing,
   expect Na to rise with that
   - D/c HCTZ
   - check pm lytes, if continue to trend down, check urine lytes
   # s/p TAH:  Minimal pain this morning, on dilaudid with good effect.
   Seroosanguinous drainage from incision as is expected
   - pain control Dilaudid prn (received ; No Toradol [**2-19**] G6PD)
   - d/c foley

   # Sommnolence: Resolved completely.  Initial respiratory depression [**2-19**]
   narcotics + likely obesity hypoventilation.  Intermittently desats to
   80's while sleeping though fine when awake

   - conintue NPH and SSI, add up SSI requirement and will add half to NPH
   dosing (split am and pm)
   - hold metformin until discharge
   - discuss ASA with Gyn before restarting

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and HIV on HAART. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy for fibroids and was admitted to the ICU due to somnolence requiring BiPAP in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after receiving analgesics.

Key findings from the progress note include:

1. NPH increased from 20u to 25u: The patient's NPH (Neutral Protonix) dosage was increased from 20 units to 25 units. This medication is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics.

2. Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the 180s-200s. She was given intravenous hydralazine and oral medications including hydralazine, amlodipine, and metoprolol to manage her blood pressure. The goal blood pressure range is 140-160/90-100 mmHg.

3. Renal Doppler study ordered for possible renal artery stenosis (RAS): The patient may have RAS, and a renal doppler study has been ordered to further evaluate this condition.

4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium level was 126, indicating hyponatremia. Her chloride level was also low at 91. This may be related to diuretic use and autodiuresis. The healthcare team decided"

   Assessment and Plan
   47F with HTN, DM, HIV on HAART, s/p TAH for fibroids, with somnolence
   requiring BiPAP in PACU after receiving analgesics, also with
   hypertensive urgency and continuing hypertesion.
   # HTN:  Continued to be HTN to 200's requiring po prn po and iv
   medications.  Has responded well to hydralizine, but given that it is a
   q6h dosing, need to have her on something less frequent as she will
   likely need to be discharged on this.  Hctz was stopped yesterday due
   to hyponatremia.
   - goal BP's 140-160--goal was 160-170 with first 24 hours, but has
   continued to be in hypertensive urgency, so should still be cautious of
   lower bp too aggressively and cauing cerebral ischemia [**2-19**] to
   autoregulation
   - continue lisinopril40 qd, metoprolol increased to 75/50/75 mg tid
   yesterday, Amlodipine was increased to 10 mg daily ysterday.  Also on
   hydralazine 25 mg q 6h.  Consider increasing metoprolol if her SBPs
   remain uncontrolled.
   - had abd CT in [**Month (only) **], no evidence of adrenal mass
   - Will obtain a renal US with dopplers to evaluate for RAS
   - continue iv hydral prn
   # Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: Na 125 this am (from 126) and Cl 89 this
   morning, have been low in past.  Likely [**2-19**] to diuretic use, however it
   did not improve after HCTZ was stopped yesterday.  Potassium is low, so
   unlikely to be due to adrenal insufficency.  TTE showed EF of > 55% in
   [**2196**] and no history of heart failure.  The patient appears volume
   overloaded.  Una 48, Ucl 36, Uosm 232.  Una > 40 would support SIADH as
   the kidneys are not holding onto Na avidly.  Patient is
   auto-diuresising which may be contributing to her hyponatremia.
   - Continue free water restriction of 1.5 L/day.
   - Recheck lytes this afternoon, if not improving would free water
   restrict to 1 L/day.
   - Pain control with percocet prn.
   # Chest pain: Was resolved by morning rounds.  Was likely
   musculoskeletal pain vs pleuritic pain from her lungs given no EKG
   changes and the description of the pain as well as its reproducibility
   on exam.
   - Continue to monitor.
   - Recheck and EKG if her pain changes at all.
   - Pain control with percocet prn.
   # s/p TAH:  Minimal pain this morning, not requiring dilaudid often.
   Seroosanguinous drainage from incision as is expected
   - pain control with percocet prn, dilaudid if necessary (received ; No
   Toradol [**2-19**] G6PD)
   - encourage ambulation
   - ADAT
   # Diabetes: Patient
s NPH was increased from 20qam/pm to 25 units [**Hospital1 **].
   Sugars still in 200's.  Would like <180 given recent surgery.
   - conintue NPH and SSI, continue to monitor for the day and consider
   further increases in NPH tomorrow as her NPH was just changed
   yesterday.

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and HIV on HAART. She is currently in the ICU after undergoing a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) for fibroids. 

The patient's main concerns include increased NPH levels from 20u to 25u, continued hypertension with blood pressures ranging from 180s-200s, and ongoing chest pain described as pleuritic central chest pain without any EKG changes. She also complains of new right lateral thigh numbness and lower back pain. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1C (100.5F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 141/64mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on 2 L nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, Hct, and glucose levels. The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125, hypochloremia with a chloride level of 89, and low potassium. 

The patient's chest pain is likely musculoskeletal pain versus pleuritic pain from her lungs, considering there were no EKG changes and the description of the pain. 

The patient's pain control will be managed with Percocet prn, and she should continue to monitor for any changes in pain. 

For her recent TAH, minimal pain was"

   Assessment and Plan
   47F with HTN, DM, HIV on HAART, s/p TAH for fibroids, with somnolence
   requiring BiPAP in PACU after receiving analgesics, also with
   hypertensive urgency and continuing hypertesion.
   # HTN:  Continued to be HTN to 200's requiring po prn po and iv
   medications.  Has responded well to hydralizine, but given that it is a
   q6h dosing, need to have her on something less frequent as she will
   likely need to be discharged on this.  Hctz was stopped yesterday due
   to hyponatremia.
   - goal BP's 140-160--goal was 160-170 with first 24 hours, but has
   continued to be in hypertensive urgency, so should still be cautious of
   lower bp too aggressively and cauing cerebral ischemia [**2-19**] to
   autoregulation
   - continue lisinopril40 qd, metoprolol increased to 75/50/75 mg tid
   yesterday, Amlodipine was increased to 10 mg daily ysterday.  Also on
   hydralazine 25 mg q 6h.  Consider increasing hydralazine to 50 q6h if
   her pressures remain elevated.
   - had abd CT in [**Month (only) **], no evidence of adrenal mass
   - Will obtain a renal US with dopplers to evaluate for RAS
   - continue iv hydral prn
   # Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: Na 125 this am (from 126) and Cl 89 this
   morning, have been low in past.  Likely [**2-19**] to diuretic use, however it
   did not improve after HCTZ was stopped yesterday.  Potassium is low, so
   unlikely to be due to adrenal insufficency.  TTE showed EF of > 55% in
   [**2196**] and no history of heart failure.  The patient appears evolemic to
   slightly volume overloaded.  Most likely due to SIADH.  Una 48, Ucl 36,
   Uosm 232.  Una > 40 would support SIADH as the kidneys are not holding
   onto Na avidly.
   - Continue free water restriction of 1.5 L/day.
   - Recheck lytes this afternoon, if not improving would free water
   restrict to 1 L/day.
   - Pain control with percocet prn.
   # s/p TAH:  Minimal pain this morning, not requiring dilaudid often.
   Seroosanguinous drainage from incision as is expected
   - pain control with percocet prn, dilaudid if necessary (received ; No
   Toradol [**2-19**] G6PD)
   - encourage ambulation
   - ADAT
   # Diabetes: Patient
s NPH was increased from 20qam/pm to 25 units [**Hospital1 **].
   Sugars still in 200's.  Would like <180 given recent surgery.
   - conintue NPH and SSI, continue to monitor for the day and consider
   further increases in NPH tomorrow as her NPH was just changed
   yesterday.
   - hold metformin until discharge
   - discuss ASA with Gyn before restarting
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue pravastatin
   # HIV
   - continue atazanavir, truvada, ritonavir
   - acyclovir ppx

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HIV on HAART therapy, and who recently underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) for fibroids. She was admitted to the ICU due to somnolence requiring BiPAP in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after receiving analgesics. She also presented with hypertensive urgency and continued hypertension. The patient's current complaints include chest pain described as pleuritic central chest pain, new right lateral thigh numbness, and lower back pain. Her vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing some fluid balance issues with an overall negative balance of 1,785 mL since 12 AM. She has been on various medications including antihypertensives, antidiabetics, and prophylactic antibiotics. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hyponatremia and hypochloremia. The patient's assessment includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HIV, s/p TAH, hyponatremia/hypochloremia, and possible SIADH. The plan includes continuing antihypertensive medications, adjusting insulin therapy, monitoring for further increases in NPH dosage, and managing pain with pain relief medications as needed. The patient's ICU stay has been uneventful, and she is currently on a regular diet"
