   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities and currently showing signs of respiratory failure, fever, hypotension, and potential nutrition alteration. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.8Â°F, heart rate ranging from 90 to 155 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67/48 mmHg to 111/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, micafungin), vasopressin, neosynephrine, low tidal volume ventilation, and sedation. The patient's arterial blood gas results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 152. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (15.5 K/uL), low hemoglobin level (8.5 g/dL), high glucose level (203 mg/dL), and abnormal liver function tests (elevated AST and ALT levels). Imaging studies reveal a right IJ at the cavoatrial junction, small right pneumothorax, diffuse lung parenchymal opacities, tracheostomy catheter in place, and negative bilateral"

   hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes
   of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure now with fevers,
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   Shock:  Most likely etiology is septic shock in the setting of fevers,
   tachycardia, leukocytosis and hypotension.  Now significantly improved
   s/p fluid resuscitation.  Switched from neosynephrine to vasopressin
   with resolution of her tachycardia.  Source of her shock is unclear.
   Sputum, blood, urine, and mycolytic cultures are pending.  She is not
   having diarrhea but will try to send clostridum difficile.  Given
   improvement with resuscitation, other etiologies of shock such as
   cardiac, obstructive, hypovolemic shock are less likely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness who was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She has a history of prolonged hospitalization and multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, which improved after fluid resuscitation. She was switched from neosynephrine to vasopressin with resolution of her tachycardia. The source of her shock is unclear, and cultures are pending. The patient's respiratory failure is being treated with low tidal volume ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. She also has a hemothorax with minimal drainage, a hip fracture that is healing well, and there are no signs of venous clots in the femoral and internal jugular veins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension suggests septic shock. The improvement with fluid resuscitation and the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics support this diagnosis. Monitoring for signs of persistent shock and adjusting the treatment accordingly is essential.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening fevers and respiratory failure indicate the possibility of VAP. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics is necessary, and weaning off the"

   Assessment and Plan: 44 year old female with a history of mental
   retardation and deafness who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on
   [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged
   hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes
   of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure now with fevers,
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   Shock:  Most likely etiology is septic shock in the setting of fevers,
   tachycardia, leukocytosis and hypotension.  Now significantly improved
   s/p fluid resuscitation.  Switched from neosynephrine to vasopressin
   with resolution of her tachycardia.  Source of her shock is unclear.
   Sputum, blood, urine, and mycolytic cultures are pending.  She is not
   having diarrhea but will try to send clostridum difficile.  Given
   improvement with resuscitation, other etiologies of shock such as
   cardiac, obstructive, hypovolemic shock are less likely.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - will attempt to wean vasopressin today
   - echocardiogram to assess for signs of right heart strain, pulmonary
   hypertension
   - blood, urine, sputum, stool cultures
   - send pleural fluid cx
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for VAP vs. hospital acquired
   pneumonia
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**]
   - if diarrhea will start flagyl
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Currently being
   ventilated per ARDSnet protocol given PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200.
   Given worsening fevers and shock we are treating broadly for ventilator
   acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia
   - low tidal volume ventilation (currently on 7 cc/kg after not
   tolerating 6 cc/kg)
   - Plateau pressures borderline at 30-32
   - recheck ABG and central venous sat
   - may need esophageal balloon
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube currently draining minimal serosanguinous
   fluid.
   - thoracis to look at chest tube.
   - continue to monitor output
   - trend hematocrit
   Firm abdomen: refluxed tube feeds from [**Last Name (un) **] hoff
   - change to NG tube to check
   s/p HIP fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   ? Venous clots in femoral and internal jugular veins:  Right IJ widely
   patent on bedside ultrasound.  Central line now in place.  Formal
   ultrasounds negative for clots.

- The patient had a multi-lumen placed and was started on neosynephrine titrated to maximum dose, as well as vasopressin.
- Upper and lower extremity dopplers were performed without evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient was started on vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin.
- Low tidal volume ventilation was initiated but resulted in asynchronous ventilation, leading to increased sedation. The patient was then switched to 7 cc/kg tidal volumes due to acidosis, although plateau pressures near 30 were noted.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Medications: Various antibiotics and antifungal agents were administered.
- Vital signs: The patient had a maximum temperature of 101.8 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 67/48 to 89/51 mmHg, heart rate between 90 and 155 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 18 and 49 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

   Imaging:
   Echocardiogram [**2169-8-30**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac
   index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Portable CXR [**2169-8-30**]: Tracheostomy tube is in the standard position.
   Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Cardiac size is top normal.
   Right chest tube remains in place. Decrease in size in moderate right
   pleural effusion. Mild left pleural effusion is unchanged. Diffuse
   pulmonary opacities left greater then right have improved on the right.
   Previously seen radiolucency projecting over the right cardiac border
   is no longer visualized.
   Portable CXR [**2169-8-31**]: Persistent b/l infiltrates
   KUB [**2169-8-30**]: No evidence of ileus or small-bowel obstruction. Diffuse
   stool.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 44 year old female with a history of mental
   retardation and deafness who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on
   [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged
   hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes
   of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure now with fevers,
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   Septic Shock:  Source continues to be unclear although most likely
   etiology is lung given diffuse infiltrates which worsened prior to MICU
   transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid resuscitation and broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Urine and sputum with yeast, not yet speciated.
   Blood cultures negative.  No diarrhea.  Now off pressors as of 3 AM
   this morning.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - restart vasopressin if necessary
   - f/u cultures
   - blood, urine, sputum, pleural fluid cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] (pending speciation of yeast in
   urine)
   - if persistent non-albicans species will repeat imaging of urinary
   system to determine tx course
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Currently being
   ventilated per ARDSnet protocol given PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 on
   presentation.  Also treating broadly for ventilator acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia
   - now tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant dysynchrony.  ABG with
   acceptable permissive hypercapnia.
   - Plateau pressures borderline at 30-32
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube currently draining minimal serosanguinous
   fluid.  Pleural fluid yesterday with 74 WBC.
   - appreciate thoracics assistance with chest tube
   - continue to monitor output
   - trend hematocrit
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appears constipated.
   Tube feeds currently on hold due to emesis.
   - trial of methylnaltrexone
   - add lactulose to bowel regimen
   - cont to hold tube feeds
   - switching to NGT from Dobhoff to allow for monitoring of residuals
   s/p HIP fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues

   Imaging:
   Echocardiogram [**2169-8-30**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac
   index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Portable CXR [**2169-8-30**]:
   Tracheostomy tube is in the standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is
   in
   the mid SVC. Cardiac size is top normal. Right chest tube remains in
   place.
   Decrease in size in moderate right pleural effusion. Mild left pleural
   effusion is unchanged. Diffuse pulmonary opacities left greater then
   right
   have improved on the right. Previously seen radiolucency projecting
   over the
   right cardiac border is no longer visualized.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 44 year old female with a history of mental
   retardation and deafness who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on
   [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged
   hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes
   of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure now with fevers,
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   Septic Shock:  Source continues to be unclear although most likely
   etiology is lung given diffuse infiltrates which worsened prior to MICU
   transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid resuscitation and broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Urine and sputum with yeast, not yet speciated.
   Blood cultures negative.  No diarrhea.  Now off pressors as of 3 AM
   this morning.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - restart vasopressin if necessary
   - f/u cultures
   - blood, urine, sputum, pleural fluid cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] (pending speciation of yeast in
   urine)
   - if persistent non albicans species will repeat imaging of urinary
   system
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Currently being
   ventilated per ARDSnet protocol given PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 on
   presentation.  Also treating broadly for ventilator acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia
   - now tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant disynchrony.  ABG with
   acceptable permissive hypercapnia.
   - Plateau pressures borderline at 30-32
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube currently draining minimal serosanguinous
   fluid.  Pleural fluid yesterday with 74 WBC.
   - appreciate thoracics assistance with chest tube
   - continue to monitor output
   - trend hematocrit
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus.  Tube feeds currently
   on hold.
   - cautiously restart tube feeds
   - consider switching to NGT from Dobhoff to allow for monitoring of
   residuals
   s/p HIP fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation as above, replete electrolytes, restart tube
   feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock, respiratory failure, ARDS, hemothorax, and a firm abdomen. She has a history of prolonged hospitalization and multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The source of septic shock is unclear, but it is likely related to the lungs given the diffuse infiltrates. Her urine and sputum cultures show yeast, while blood cultures are negative. She has been resuscitated with fluids and is off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP with antibiotics and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and continued administration of appropriate antibiotics are essential.
2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. She is being ventilated per ARDSnet protocol. Monitoring her oxygenation and adjusting ventilation settings accordingly are important.
3. Hemothorax: The patient has a chest tube draining minimal serosanguinous fluid, and pleural fluid showed 74 WBC. Monitoring the output of the chest tube and trend hematocrit levels are necessary.
4. Firm abdomen: The patient's KUB shows no evidence of ileus or small-bowel obstruction. However, tube feeds are"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 44 year old female with a history of mental
   retardation and deafness who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on
   [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged
   hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes
   of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure now with fevers,
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   Shock:  Most likely etiology is septic shock in the setting of fevers,
   tachycardia, leukocytosis and hypotension.  Now significantly improved
   s/p fluid resuscitation.  Switched from neosynephrine to vasopressin
   with resolution of her tachycardia.  Source of her shock is unclear.
   Sputum, blood, urine, and mycolytic cultures are pending.  She is not
   having diarrhea but will try to send clostridum difficile.  Given
   improvement with resuscitation, other etiologies of shock such as
   cardiac, obstructive, hypovolemic shock are less likely.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - will attempt to wean vasopressin today
   - echocardiogram to assess for signs of right heart strain, pulmonary
   hypertension
   - blood, urine, sputum, stool cultures
   - send pleural fluid cx
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for VAP vs. hospital acquired
   pneumonia
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**]
   - if diarrhea will start flagyl
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Currently being
   ventilated per ARDSnet protocol given PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200.
   Given worsening fevers and shock we are treating broadly for ventilator
   acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia
   - low tidal volume ventilation (currently on 7 cc/kg after not
   tolerating 6 cc/kg)
   - Plateau pressures borderline at 30-32
   - recheck ABG and central venous sat
   - may need esophageal balloon
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube currently draining minimal serosanguinous
   fluid.
   - thoracis to look at chest tube.
   - continue to monitor output
   - trend hematocrit
   Firm abdomen: refluxed tube feeds from [**Last Name (un) **] hoff
   - change to NG tube to check
   s/p HIP fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   ? Venous clots in femoral and internal jugular veins:  Right IJ widely
   patent on bedside ultrasound.  Central line now in place.  Formal
   ultrasounds negative for clots.
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation as above, replete electrolytes, hold tube
   feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization. The patient had multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. Currently, she is experiencing fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, indicating possible septic shock. She has been resuscitated and her condition has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's symptoms of fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest the possibility of septic shock. Immediate management includes fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and worsening fevers, there is a risk of developing VAP. Treatment involves broad-spectrum antibiotics and adherence to ARDSnet ventilation protocols.

3. Right Hip Fracture: The patient has a history of a right hip fracture. Although the wound is healing well, it is important to monitor for any signs of dislocation or complications related to the fracture.

4. Hemothorax: The patient has a chest tube draining minimal serosanguinous fluid, indicating a potential hemothorax. Continuous monitoring of the chest tube output and trends in hematocrit levels are necessary.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness.
- She was transferred to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization.
- The patient has had multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for presumed septic shock.
- The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS, a possible hip fracture, constipation, and a history of mental retardation and deafness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of septic shock, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS and requires close monitoring and management.
3. Hip Fracture: Although the fracture seems to be healing well, it needs to be closely monitored for any signs of dislocation or complications.
4. Constipation: The patient has failed enemas and requires further intervention to relieve constipation.
5. Prolonged Hospitalization: The patient's prolonged hospitalization increases the risk of healthcare-associated infections and other complications.
6. Mental Retardation and Deafness: These pre-existing conditions may affect the patient's ability to communicate and follow medical instructions.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS physiology caused by multifocal pneumonia, as well as right pleural effusion/thorax and right chest tube drainage.
- Sepsis: The patient is presumed to have septic shock, with potential sources including pleural infection, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. Antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin.
- Shock: The patient has been on vasopressor support since this morning at 0300.
- HIP Fracture: The patient had a hip fracture, but there are no signs of dislocation. The wound is healing well, and plain films of the hip have been obtained for assessment.
- Constipation: The patient failed enemas yesterday, so the Dobhoff tube has been changed to a nasogastric tube. Methylnatrexone and lactulose will be attempted as well.

   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled
   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure now with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension.
   Septic Shock:  Source continues to be unclear although most likely
   etiology is lung given diffuse infiltrates which worsened prior to MICU
   transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid resuscitation and broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Urine and sputum with yeast, not yet speciated.
   Blood cultures negative.  No diarrhea.  Now off pressors as of 3 AM
   this morning.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - restart vasopressin if necessary
   - f/u cultures
   - blood, urine, sputum, pleural fluid cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina (day [**4-23**])
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] (pending speciation of yeast in
   urine)
   - renal ultrasound today to assess for renal involvement of yeast
   species
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Currently being
   ventilated per ARDSnet protocol given PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 on
   presentation.  Also treating broadly for ventilator acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia day [**4-23**]
   - now tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant dysynchrony.  ABG with
   acceptable permissive hypercapnia.
   - Plateau pressures borderline at 30-32
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube currently draining minimal serosanguinous
   fluid.  Pleural fluid yesterday with 74 WBC.
   - appreciate thoracics assistance with chest tube
   - continue to monitor output
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   currently on hold due to emesis.  NGT not placed yesterday secondary to
   surgically created nasal passages.
   - restart tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin; will speak to IP re: possibility
   next Mon/Tues
   s/p HIP fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization. The patient has had multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and is being treated for septic shock.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/54 to 173/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her temperature is within normal limits.

The patient has several medical conditions that need to be addressed. She has an infection indicated by fevers and elevated white blood cell count. Blood cultures are pending, but so far, they have been negative. The source of the infection is unclear, but it is likely related to the lungs given the diffuse infiltrates. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and yeast has been identified in the urine and sputum, although it has not yet been speciated.

The patient also has respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which she is being ventilated per ARDSnet protocol. She is also being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Additionally, the patient has hemothorax, as indicated by the chest tube draining minimal serosanguinous fluid. The pleural fluid yesterday showed"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, acute. The patient has a history of nasal reconstruction, making it difficult to place a nasogastric tube (NGT). An ileostomy procedure was performed, and the patient is experiencing bilious emesis, indicating possible bowel obstruction or ileus.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/54 to 173/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 cc/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pH 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 55 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 253.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.5 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.3 g/dL, glucose level of 102 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 111 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 3.4 mEq/L, and creatinine (Cr) level of 0.4 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count is low, and the levels of albumin, lactic acid, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) are within normal ranges. Imaging studies show bilateral opacities on chest X-ray (CXR), suggestive of pneumonia.

The patient's medical history includes a recent abdominal surgery, for which he developed postoperative complications such as fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care. However, he continues to have bilious emesis, indicating an ongoing bowel obstruction or ileus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation, further deterioration of renal function, development of nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), worsening nutritional status, and possible progression of bowel obstruction or ileus leading to perforation or peritonitis.

In summary, the patient is a 45-year-old male with acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to a severe underlying condition such as sepsis or multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. The patient's clinical course is complicated by multiple factors including bowel obstruction or ileus, pneumonia, and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation."

      URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
         YEAST, PRESUMPTIVELY NOT C. ALBICANS.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled
   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure now with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension.
   Septic Shock:  Source continues to be unclear although most likely
   etiology is lung given diffuse infiltrates which worsened prior to MICU
   transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid resuscitation and broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Urine and sputum with yeast, not yet speciated.
   Blood cultures negative.  No diarrhea.  Now off pressors as of 3 AM
   this morning.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - restart vasopressin if necessary
   - f/u cultures
   - blood, urine, sputum, pleural fluid cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina (day [**4-23**])
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] (pending speciation of yeast in
   urine)
   - renal ultrasound today to assess for renal involvement of yeast
   species
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Currently being
   ventilated per ARDSnet protocol given PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 on
   presentation.  Also treating broadly for ventilator acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia day [**4-23**]
   - now tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant dysynchrony.  ABG with
   acceptable permissive hypercapnia.
   - Plateau pressures borderline at 30-32
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube currently draining minimal serosanguinous
   fluid.  Pleural fluid yesterday with 74 WBC.
   - appreciate thoracics assistance with chest tube
   - continue to monitor output
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   currently on hold due to emesis.  NGT not placed yesterday secondary to
   surgically created nasal passages.
   - restart tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin; will speak to IP re: possibility
   next Mon/Tues
   s/p HIP fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Very stimulus-dependent.
   - monitor on tele

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   [**Known firstname 792**] has now begun to autodiurese and her HR has remained stable off
   pressors but with sedation. All cultures do not reveal new septic
   source and she even had a large BM overnight.
   We will resume tube feeds but if unable to advance, start TPN to keep
   nutritional reserves repleted. She will need
slow
 ventilator wean and
   limits to this will be anasarca, secretion control and level of anxiety
   manifested by tachycardia.
   We will also request Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] to consider placement of PEG tube next
   week so that she can transition to LTAC unit for weaning soon
   thereafter.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient now presents with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, indicating septic shock. The source of infection is unclear but is likely from the lungs given the diffuse infiltrates. Blood cultures are negative, while urine and sputum cultures show yeast, not yet speciated.

The patient also has respiratory failure/ARDS, for which she is being ventilated per ARDSnet protocol. She is also being treated broadly for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Her chest tube is draining minimal serosanguinous fluid, and there is a concern for hemothorax. The patient's abdomen is firm, and there was a previous concern for constipation, but this has resolved. The patient is currently on hold for tube feeds due to emesis. The patient's hip fracture is healing well without signs of dislocation.

The patient's tachycardia is likely anxiety-related. The plan includes restarting tube feeds, monitoring for any signs of complications, and continuing with the current antibiotics and antifungal therapy. The patient's code status remains as full code."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female with a medical history of [medical history], currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing persistent tachycardia. She has a tracheostomy in place, which needs to be repositioned due to impingement of the right tracheal wall. The patient's renal function is being monitored through regular renal ultrasounds, which have not shown any signs of abscess or hydronephrosis. The patient's recent lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Imaging studies reveal widespread parenchymal opacities consistent with progression of ARDS or superimposed pulmonary edema, as well as bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's nutritional status is being addressed with fiber source nutrition. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure indicates a serious complication. The progression of ARDS or superimposed pulmonary edema seen on the CXR raises concerns for potential worsening of respiratory function.

2. Tracheostomy Complications: The need to reposition the tracheostomy tube due to impingement on the right tracheal wall suggests the possibility of complications related to the trache"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization due to multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, indicating septic shock. The source of infection is unclear but likely originates from the lungs, given the diffuse infiltrates seen on chest X-ray.

The patient has been treated with fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which have significantly improved her condition. She is now off pressors. However, the patient still requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for various medical complications.

1. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition needs to be addressed through tube feeds, intravenous fluids (IVF) as needed, and repletion of electrolytes as required.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is currently being ventilated according to ARDSnet protocol due to a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 on presentation. She is tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant dysynchrony, and her ABG values are within acceptable limits with permissive hypercapnia. Plateau pressures are borderline at 30-32.
3. Hemothorax: The chest tube has been removed, and the pleural fluid culture is negative. The patient's hematocrit should"

   of the
   line being at the level of cavoatrial junction/low SVC. The Dobbhoff
   tube is
   in the proximal stomach. There is interval significant worsening
   widespread parenchymal opacities
   consistent with progression of ARDS or may be superimposed pulmonary
   edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present. There is no
   evidence of pneumothorax. The right chest tube was removed prior to the
   previous radiograph that was obtained on [**2169-8-31**] at 3:21 p.m. On
   the current radiograph, there is minimal apical lucency seen on the

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization. She has had multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is currently experiencing fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension. She has diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating possible progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or superimposed pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has improved with fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, but she still requires mechanical ventilation and is being treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Other issues include hemothorax, firm abdomen, and a history of a hip fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to being on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular cultures are necessary.
2. ARDS: The patient's diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest worsening ARDS. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and lung function is essential. Following ARDSnet protocol for ventilation is crucial.
3. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, there is a concern for sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management with antibiotics and supportive care are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with congenital deafness and developmental delay who was initially admitted to the hospital following a fall. She underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery and developed chronic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis likely from a pulmonary source. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis, which is now resolved. However, there is still a risk of developing sepsis again due to her immunocompromised state and presence of a tracheostomy.
2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may result in long-term respiratory compromise and the need for supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be common in critically ill patients. It is important to monitor for changes in mental status and ensure appropriate communication with the family.
5. Candiduria: The patient has candiduria, indicating a fungal infection in the urinary tract. This requires prompt treatment to prevent the progression of infection.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased, indicating anemia. Close monitoring of blood counts and consideration of blood transfusion may be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of congenital deafness and developmental delay. She was initially admitted to OSH following a fall and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient developed chronic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis likely from a pulmonary source. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications including erythromycin, micafungin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. She is also receiving infusions of midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.6Â°C, current temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate (HR) of 111 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 139/82 mmHg to 105/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight has increased from 45.5 kg at admission to 58.1 kg currently. Her height is 60 inches. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,288 mL and output of 2,485 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 260 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O, and a respiratory system compliance of 14.4 cmH2O/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal range.

Physical examination reveals right arm ecchymosis and a surgical incision post ORIF. Neurological examination is not assessable due to the patient's unresponsive state.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 474 K/uL, and normal liver function tests. Urinalysis shows candiduria.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis is now resolved, but the patient still has candiduria.
2. The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is on ARDSnet ventilation.
3. The patient has ARDS and is on ARDSnet ventilation for the past three days.
4. The patient is experiencing delirium.
5. The patient has anemia with a decrease in hemoglobin from 29% to 24%.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with congenital deafness and developmental delay. She was initially admitted to OSH following a fall and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. The patient has chronic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She also developed sepsis, likely from a pulmonary source. 

24-hour events include the administration of various antibiotics and changes in the patient's medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/82 to 105/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 260 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 250. 

Physical examination findings include right arm ecchymosis and surgical incision post ORIF. Neurological examination was not assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness.
- She was transferred to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization.
- The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- She is currently being treated for septic shock, likely due to a pulmonary cause, and has shown improvement with fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient's urine culture is positive for C. difficile, but she does not have diarrhea, and her renal ultrasound is negative for abscess.
- She is off pressors and her vital signs are stable.
- The patient has respiratory failure and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and is being ventilated according to the ARDSnet protocol.
- She is also receiving treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- The patient previously had hemothorax, but her chest tube has been removed and the pleural fluid culture is negative.
- She had a firm abdomen, which has resolved with aggressive bowel regimen, and tube feeds have been restarted.
- The patient had a hip fracture, but there are no signs of dislocation or misalignment.
- She is experiencing tachycardia, which is likely due to anxiety and is very stimulus-dependent.

   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure now with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension.
   Septic Shock:  Source continues to be unclear although most likely
   etiology is lung given diffuse infiltrates which worsened prior to MICU
   transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid resuscitation and broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Urine and sputum with yeast, not yet speciated.
   Blood cultures negative.  No diarrhea.  Now off pressors.  Renal
   ultrasound negative for abscess.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - restart vasopressin if necessary

   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Currently being
   ventilated per ARDSnet protocol given PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 on
   presentation.  Also treating broadly for ventilator acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia day [**4-23**]
   - now tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant dysynchrony.  ABG with
   normalization pH
   - Plateau pressures stable in 20s
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube removed and pleural fluid cx with no growth
   thus far.
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restareted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin; will speak to IP re: possibility

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG due to prolonged hospitalization complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. 

The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggesting septic shock. The source of infection is unclear, but it is likely related to the lungs given the presence of diffuse infiltrates. The patient has shown improvement after fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Urine and sputum cultures revealed yeast, but they have not been speciated yet. Blood cultures were negative.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:
1. IVF for urine output <30 cc/hr, CVP <11, MAP <60, SVV <1.
2. Restart vasopressin if necessary.
3. Follow-up cultures.
4. Blood, urine, sputum, and pleural fluid cultures.
5. Continue vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for ventilator-associated pneumonia until September 6th.
6. Continue micafungin for Foley catheter.
7. Change Foley catheter again today.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been in the ICU since [**2169-8-28**] and is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (Erythromycin, Micafungin, Vancomycin, Cefipime, Ciprofloxacin), sedatives (Midazolam), pain management (Fentanyl), and prophylactic treatments (Heparin Sodium, Famotidine).
- Vital signs show a tachycardia with a heart rate of 122 bpm, slightly elevated blood pressure ranging from 120/55 mmHg to 183/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's weight has increased from 45.5 kg at admission to 58.1 kg currently.
- Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, fluid balance with an input of 2,977 mL and output of 1,466 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,511 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a volume control mode, set tidal volume of 260 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- Physical examination reveals an intact tracheostomy site, warm and well-perfused extremities, but a hematoma on the right arm. No other significant abnormalities were noted.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 564 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 133 mg/dL, creatinine of 6 mg/dL, and potassium levels within normal range.
- The patient's platelet count is stable, ranging from 11.8 to 12.3 K/uL.
- Imaging studies and other test results are not provided in the given information.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating a possible ongoing or recurrent infection. The presence of fever and leukocytosis supports this concern.
2. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance of 1,511 mL suggests the possibility of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function.
3. Delirium or agitation: The use of sedatives (Midazolam) and the presence of restraints may indicate potential delirium or agitation, which requires careful monitoring and management.
4. Pressure injuries: Prolonged immobility and the presence of a tracheostomy tube increase the risk of pressure injuries, particularly in vulnerable areas such as the sacrum or heels.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures (boots, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin) are in place to prevent DVT, but the patient's immobility and central venous catheter may still predispose him to this complication.

Please note that this summary is based on the limited information provided in the progress note, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate assessment of the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of congenital deafness and developmental delay. She was initially admitted to the hospital following a fall and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient has chronic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She required a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient developed sepsis likely from a pulmonary source and was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and was given appropriate empiric therapy. The patient's delirium is unclear, and she may need an ASL interpreter if family is unavailable. She has candiduria, and her Foley catheter was changed. The patient's anemia is stable without transfusion. She previously had hemothorax but the chest tube was removed. Her total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is at goal. The plan is to transition her sedation from midazolam (versed) to lorazepam (ativan) via the PEG tube. The patient's analgesia will continue with fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure - The patient's chronic respiratory failure puts her at risk for ongoing respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or further ARDS.
2. Sepsis - Although the patient's sepsis appears to be resolved, there is still a risk of"

   I was physically present with the housestaff team on this date and
   independently examined the patient.  I would agree with the findings
   and plan as defined above and would add the following comments.
   48 yo female admitted with chronic respiratory failure to medical ICU.
   Patient is now s/p tracheostomy with evolution of significant sepsis
   [**2169-8-28**].  With IVF and ABX rx she has had improved sepsis.
   Patient had CVL
s changed completely and remains on antibiotic therapy
   which will continue.
   For persistent ventilatory failure will maintain pt on low volume
   ventilation with volume targeted ventilation and move to wean when
   patient able to maintain improved oxygenation and is still confronted
   with persistent infiltrates
will move to PSV today given favorable
   minute ventilation requirement, reasonable plateau pressure and
   excellent mental alertness.
   Critical Care Time-35 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of congenital deafness, developmental delay, and chronic respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU following a fall and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She had sepsis likely from a pulmonary source and ongoing bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure - The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, and the current ARDSnet ventilation strategy is being used to manage her condition. The risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be closely monitored.
2. Sepsis - Although the patient's sepsis appears to be resolved, there is a positive culture in the urine with Foley catheter. This raises concerns about a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), which could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been started, and the chest X-ray shows ongoing bilateral infiltrates.
4. ARDS - The patient is still on ARDSnet ventilation, and it will be important to monitor her oxygenation and ABG values regularly.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of congenital deafness, developmental delay, and chronic respiratory failure. She was initially admitted to OSH after a fall and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was transferred to the ICU with sepsis likely from a pulmonary source. Since admission, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and is currently on ARDSnet ventilation. The patient has ongoing bilateral infiltrates and is being treated for various conditions including chronic respiratory failure, sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ARDS, possible delirium, candiduria, anemia, hemothorax, and enteral nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying chronic respiratory condition may continue to pose a challenge in weaning off ventilatory support.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis appears to be resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence due to her immunocompromised state and presence of ongoing bilateral infiltrates.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. ARDS: The patient may experience worsening of ARDS symptoms or complications such as hypoxemia and difficulty weaning from mechanical"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of congenital deafness and developmental delay. She was initially admitted to the hospital following a fall and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. The patient developed chronic respiratory failure, likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and subsequently sepsis from a presumed pulmonary source. Sepsis has now been resolved, with only positive urine culture results. The patient has been receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for treatment.

The patient's current condition includes ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), chronic respiratory failure post-tracheostomy, and ARDS. She is on ARDSnet ventilation and is not attempting an aggressive wean due to the low tidal volume strategy and recent sepsis. There are concerns about delirium, and the plan is to discuss this with the family or obtain an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter if needed. The patient also has candiduria, and a change in Foley catheter with follow-up cultures has been planned. Renal ultrasound did not show any abscess. Anemia has improved from Hct 29% to 24%, and transfusion is recommended for Hct less than 21%. The patient should have a follow-up Hct and guaiac all stools.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled
   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure now with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension.
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Month/Day/Year 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - restart vasopressin if necessary
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina to end on [**9-6**], started [**8-29**]

   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Currently being
   ventilated per ARDSnet protocol given PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 on
   presentation.  Also treating broadly for ventilator acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia, to end on [**9-6**]
   - now tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant dysynchrony; ABG with
   normalization of pH
   - Plateau pressures stable in 20s
   - lasix 10 mg IV for diuresis
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube removed and pleural fluid cx with no growth
   thus far.
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restarted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin; will speak to IP re: possibility
   next Mon/Tues

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization due to multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, which were likely related to septic shock. She has shown significant improvement since fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. The patient has diffuse infiltrates on chest x-ray, but cultures have been negative. She is now off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently being ventilated due to ARDS and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. She is also at risk for developing VAP, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started for this condition.
2. Renal issues: The patient's urine output is low, and there is a persistent presence of C. difficile in the urine. Renal ultrasound has ruled out abscess, and blood cultures are negative.
3. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing persistent tachycardia, which may be due to anxiety or extensive volume resuscitation.
4. Edema: The patient has significant edema, likely secondary to extensive volume resuscitation. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness who was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. She had a prolonged hospitalization prior to admission due to episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is now presenting with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely of pulmonary origin, and has shown improvement after fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient is also being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other medical issues include hemothorax, firm abdomen, s/p hip fracture, and tachycardia. The patient's current condition is stable, with ongoing monitoring and management of her ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular bronchial suctioning are necessary. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored based on culture results.
2. ARDS: The patient is being ventilated according to the ARDSnet protocol. Regular assessment of oxygenation and lung mechanics is crucial. Plateau pressures should be maintained below 30 cmH2O to prevent further lung injury.
3. Septic shock: Despite initial improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent septic shock. Continuous monitoring of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of congenital deafness and developmental delay. She was initially admitted to the hospital following a fall and underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). The patient then developed chronic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to sepsis likely from a pulmonary source.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient is stable on ARDSnet ventilation with pressures set at PIPs 25 and Peak 20s. The decision not to attempt an aggressive wean is due to the low tidal volume strategy and recent sepsis with ongoing bilateral infiltrates.
2. Sepsis: This condition has now resolved, with negative blood cultures except for a positive urine culture with [Female First Name]. The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, as well as a 7-day course of micafungin.
3. Sedation: The patient is currently sedated due to ICU medications. Weaning of sedation should be done daily, and an ASL interpreter should be used for communication.
4. GI access: The patient requires percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) but will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with congenital deafness and developmental delay. She was initially admitted to OSH after a fall and underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. Subsequently, she developed chronic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure. The patient was then transferred to MICU with sepsis suspected to be from a pulmonary source. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently stable on ARDSnet ventilation. Her recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. However, her blood glucose levels are elevated. Imaging shows patchy infiltrates unchanged from previous CXR. The patient's assessment and plan include chronic respiratory failure, sepsis (resolved), sedation weaning, GI access with Dobhoff tube and potential PEG placement, anasarca management, and nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and presence of bilateral infiltrates, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections, such as catheter-related"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 f w/ congenital deafness and developmental delay initially admitted
   to OSH following fall, s/p ORIF, chronic respiratory failure [**3-20**] ARDS
   c/b ptx and hemothorax, s/p VATS ([**8-22**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**8-25**] and to
   MICU with sepsis likely from a pulmonary source on [**8-28**] (last CT tube
   removed [**8-28**]), now hemodynamically stable.
   1. Chronic resp failure
 s/p tracheostomy [**8-28**].   Stable on ARDSnet
   ventilation, w/ PIPs 25 and Peak 20s.  Currently not attempting
   aggressive wean given low tidal volume strategy and recent sepsis w/
   presumed pulmonary source and ongoing b/l infiltrates.
   -diurese as below
   2. Sepsis
 now resolved.  Bx Cx neg.  Only positive culture is urine
   w/ [**Female First Name (un) **].
   -complete vanco + cefepime + cipro total 8d course for presumed VAP
   -complete 7d micafungin course today
   -concern for sinusitis given purulent nasal drainage; however would
   prefer not to d/c dobhoff as pt would then be without access for
   enteral feeds. On abx and will add saline nasal irrigation.
   3. Sedation- due to ICU meds, weaning sedation
   -daily assessment w/ ASL interpreter
   -transition back to home meds
   4. GI access- w/ Dobhoff, needs PEG but will require OR approach
   -tube feeds + TPN to improve nturition; per [**Doctor First Name **] goal albumin 2.0
   -follow pre-albumin and albumin levels
   5. Anasarca- total body fluid up, moving to dry phase of ARDS mgmt
   -diurese to goal neg -[**Telephone/Fax (1) 264**]/day w/ FACTT trial principle in mind

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 48-year-old female with congenital deafness and developmental delay. She was admitted to the hospital following a fall and underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). The patient developed chronic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to sepsis likely from a pulmonary source.

The patient's current condition is stable, but she continues to require mechanical ventilation. She has ongoing bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's nasal drainage is purulent, and there is a concern for sinusitis. She has completed a course of vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as a seven-day course of micafungin.

The patient's sedation is being weaned, and there is a plan to transition her back to home medications. She requires gastrointestinal access, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is needed. The patient's nutrition needs improvement, and she will receive tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Her albumin levels will be closely monitored.

The patient has anasarca, with total body fluid up, and is moving to the dry phase of ARDS management. Diuresis is being initiated to achieve negative fluid balance, following the FACTT trial principle."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled
   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure presented  with fevers, tachycardia and
   hypotension.
    .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Treating for VAP
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia, to end on [**9-6**]
   - Plateau pressures stable in 20s
   - lasix 10-20 mg IV for diuresis, goal -1L
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Month/Year (2) 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina to end on [**9-6**], started [**8-29**]
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] x 7 day course, started [**8-29**],
   finished last night.
   - foley catheter changed; resent urine cx
   - f/u pending cultures-NGTD
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube removed and pleural fluid cx with no growth
   thus far.
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx-NGTD
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restarted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days, checking pre-albumin
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin;
   -[**Doctor First Name **] will hold off on PEG given low albumin.
   s/p hip fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Very stimulus-dependent.
   - monitor on tele
   - boluses of sedation prn
   - start NG ativan to start weaning versed
   -resumed home clomipramine and
 dose of klonapin
   .
   Edema-likely [**3-20**] extensive volume resuscitation. Now normotensive. Will
   diurese with plan for -500cc to 1L daily.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization. The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension. She has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and septic shock. Her respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has improved following fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also had hemothorax, which has resolved, and a hip fracture, which is healing well without any surgical issues. She has been experiencing tachycardia likely due to anxiety and edema possibly from extensive volume resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been treated for VAP, but it is important to monitor for any worsening symptoms or signs of infection.
2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure that she does not develop further complications or require reintubation.
3. Septic shock: Although the patient's condition has improved, there is still a risk of recurrence, especially if there is a new source of infection or inadequate source control.
4. Hemothorax: Although the chest tube has been removed and the pleural fluid culture showed"

   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure presented  with fevers, tachycardia and
   hypotension.
    .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Treating for VAP
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator
   associated pneumonia, to end on [**9-6**]
   - now tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant dysynchrony; ABG with
   normalization of pH
   - Plateau pressures stable in 20s
   - lasix 10 mg IV for diuresis.
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Month/Year (2) 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - restart vasopressin if necessary
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina to end on [**9-6**], started [**8-29**]
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] x 7 day course, started [**8-29**], last
   day today.
   - foley catheter changed; resent urine cx
   - f/u pending cultures
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube removed and pleural fluid cx with no growth
   thus far.
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx-NGTD
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restarted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin; will speak to IP re: possibility
   next Mon/Tues
   -[**Doctor First Name **] will hold off on PEG given low albumin.
   s/p hip fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Very stimulus-dependent.
   - monitor on tele
   - boluses of sedation prn
   - start NG ativan to start weaning versed
   .
   Edema-likely [**3-20**] extensive volume resuscitation. Now normotensive. Will
   diurese with plan for -500cc to 1L daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 44 year old female with a history of mental
   retardation and deafness who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on
   [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged
   hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes
   of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure presented with fevers,
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  Treating for HAP-
   continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonia
   - low tidal volume ventilation
   .
   Shock:  Resolved. Most likely etiology was septic shock in the setting
   of fevers, tachycardia, leukocytosis and hypotension.  Patient has
   known severe lung disease from multiple recent aspiration events.  Her
   shock developed after discontinuation of antibiotics.  Sources could be
   pulmonary (no recent positive cultures), blood (PICC line in place),
   urine (recent cultures with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**]) or stool.  Cardiac
   etiology of shock is unlikely given high cardiac output/index.
   Pulmonary embolism is of concern given lack of anticoagulation but
   would have to come from upper extremity veins given DVT filter in
   place.  EKG with sinus tachycardia but without signs of right heart
   strain.  Echocardiogram from [**8-7**] with elevated pulmonary pressures but
   preserved ejection fraction.  Stable hematocrit and nutritional status
   argue against hypovolemic shock.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - blood, urine, sputum, stool cultures NGTD
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for hospital acquired pneumonia
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**]-last dose today.
   - will get upper and lower extremity dopplers to assess for venous
   clots although unable to anticoagulate given hemothorax
   .
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube currently draining minimal serosanguinous
   fluid.  No air leak.
   - continue to monitor output
   .
   s/p HIP fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.
   - f/u final read of hip films
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization from July 25, 2169, to August 25, 2169, complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.

The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, which indicated possible septic shock. The source of infection could be pulmonary, blood, urine, or stool. The patient's cardiac output was high, making cardiac etiology of shock less likely. Pulmonary embolism was also a concern due to lack of anticoagulation but would have to originate from upper extremity veins given the presence of a DVT filter. An echocardiogram from August 7 showed elevated pulmonary pressures but preserved ejection fraction. The patient's hematocrit and nutritional status were stable, arguing against hypovolemic shock.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is receiving low tidal volume ventilation.

2. Shock: The patient had resolved septic shock, likely caused by HAP. Sources of infection include pulmonary, blood, urine, or stool."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness who was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization due to multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension.
- She was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient improved after fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, although cultures remained negative.
- She is now off pressors and tolerating 6 cc/kg without significant dysynchrony, with normalization of ABG pH.
- Plateau pressures are stable in the 20s, and diuresis with lasix 10 mg IV is ongoing.
- The patient's septic shock is likely of pulmonary origin given the diffuse infiltrates, which improved significantly after fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- Urine output is less than 30 cc/hr, CVP is less than 11, MAP is less than 60, and SVV is less than 1.
- Vasopressin may be restarted if necessary.
- The patient has completed a 7-day course of micafungin for suspected fungal infection.
- Foley catheter change and repeat urine culture were performed.
- Chest tube removal was done, and pleural fluid culture showed no growth.
- The patient had a firm abdomen with no signs of obstruction or ileus but appeared constipated, which resolved with an aggressive bowel regimen.
- Tube feeds were restarted and tolerated well.
- Nasogastric tube (NGT) was not placed due to surgically created nasal passages.
- PEG tube placement is pending improved albumin levels.
- The patient had a hip fracture, but there are no signs of dislocation, and wound healing is well progressing.
- Hip films showed no evidence of misalignment.
- Orthopedics indicated no surgical issues.
- Tachycardia is likely due to anxiety, which is stimulus-dependent.
- The patient will be monitored on tele, receive boluses of sedation as needed, and start NG ativan to wean off versed.
- Edema is likely due to extensive volume resuscitation but is now normotensive.
- Diuretics will be used to plan for -500cc to 1L daily.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient is being treated for VAP, and close monitoring of respiratory parameters and infection control measures are essential to prevent its progression.
2. Renal insufficiency - The patient has persistent low urine output, and renal function should be closely monitored to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypotension - Despite being off pressors, the patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating a need for continued close monitoring and appropriate management.
4. Constipation - The patient's previous episode of constipation resolved with an aggressive bowel regimen, but ongoing monitoring and management are necessary to prevent future episodes.
5. PEG placement complications - Delaying PEG tube placement due to low albumin levels carries the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with congenital deafness and developmental delay. She was admitted to the hospital following a fall and underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). The patient developed chronic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to sepsis likely from a pulmonary source. The patient is currently stable and on ARDSnet ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient has ongoing bilateral infiltrates and is not attempting aggressive weaning due to recent sepsis. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in lung function.
2. Sepsis: The patient completed a course of VAP treatment and will receive treatment for a urinary tract infection (UTI) tomorrow. There is a risk of recurrent sepsis or antibiotic resistance.
3. Sedation: The patient is currently on ICU medications and may require weaning off sedation. There is a risk of agitation and delirium upon extubation.
4. GI access: The patient needs percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for long-term nutrition. There is a risk of procedure-related complications such as infection or perforation.
5. Anasarca: The patient has total body fluid overload and requires diuresis. There is a risk of electroly"

   48 yo female with congenital deafness and developmental delay s/p ORIF
   with acute respiratory failure related to recurrent aspiration and
   barotraumas (PTX s/p CT). Major issues include:
   1. Acute renal failure: had recent ARDS/pneumonia with slow recovery-
   continues to require mechanical ventilation but appears to be
   tolerating small weans. Continue PS ventilation as tolerated
   2. VAP-Finishing a course of Vanc/cefipime
   3. anasarca/malnutrition: unable to have G-tube placed due to concerns
   that poor nutritional status (albumin 1.6-1.7) will impede wound
   healing. Tolerating high protein enteral feeds nearly at goal,
   nutrition involved, pre-albumin pending.
   4. Agitation: appears calmer today, working on weaning fentatnyl and
   versed infusions. Pt
s home regimen of klonipin started.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 35 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with congenital deafness and developmental delay who was admitted to the ICU after falling and undergoing open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. The patient developed chronic respiratory failure due to recurrent aspiration and barotraumas, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent pneumonia. She required mechanical ventilation and was transferred to another hospital for further treatment.

Upon admission to the MICU, the patient had sepsis likely from a pulmonary source and was hemodynamically stable. The patient has a tracheostomy and is currently on ARDSnet ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) at 25 cmH2O and plateau pressures (PPS) at 20 cmH2O. Due to recent sepsis and ongoing bilateral infiltrates, the team is not aggressively weaning the patient off mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical issues include chronic respiratory failure, sepsis, sedation, gastrointestinal (GI) access, anasarca (total body swelling), and malnutrition. The patient requires continued diuresis, adjustment of sedation, completion of antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI), transition back to home medications, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and optimization of nutrition.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 119 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from "

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) due to prolonged hospitalization complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.

The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, indicating a possible septic shock. She required fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which led to significant improvement. The cultures showed no growth, suggesting that the infection was effectively treated.

The patient also had respiratory failure/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and was treated with tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. She developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which she received vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

Additionally, the patient had hemothorax, for which a chest tube was inserted and later removed when the pleural fluid culture showed no growth. She also had a firm abdomen, possibly due to constipation, which resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Her nutritional status was assessed, and she required tube feeds.

Furthermore, the patient had a history of hip fracture, but there were no signs of dislocation or misalignment. She experienced tachycardia likely due to anxiety, and her edema was attributed to extensive volume resuscitation.

In summary, the patient's medical complications include"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness, admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy and PEG due to prolonged hospitalization.
- She presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, indicating respiratory failure/ARDS and septic shock.
- The patient underwent tracheostomy and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Her condition improved after fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- She also had hemothorax, for which the chest tube was removed, and the pleural fluid culture showed no growth.
- The patient had a firm abdomen, which resolved with aggressive bowel regimen, and tube feeds were restarted.
- She had a hip fracture, but there were no signs of dislocation, and the wound is healing well.
- The patient experienced tachycardia likely due to anxiety and edema from extensive volume resuscitation.
- The plan is to continue treating for VAP, diurese with Lasix, monitor for any surgical issues, and manage anxiety.
- The patient's current condition is stable, and she is tolerating tube feeds well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been treated for VAP, but it is important to continue monitoring for any worsening respiratory symptoms or changes in oxygenation.
2. Septic shock: Although the patient's condition improved after"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness, admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization. She presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient had a history of aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and hip fracture. She was diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure/ARDS, hemothorax, firm abdomen, and tachycardia. The patient underwent several interventions including tracheostomy, fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, chest tube removal, and bowel regimen. She is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia and has completed a course of micafungin. The patient's current condition is stable, but she requires ongoing monitoring and management for her various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients. It is important to monitor her respiratory status and adjust antibiotics as needed.
2. Renal dysfunction: The patient's urine output is low, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
3. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient had a firm abdomen initially, which resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. However, there is a risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications such as ileus or bowel ischemia.
4. Infection: Despite negative"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation (MR) delay, recurrent respiratory failure, and a history of orotracheal intubation and fixation (ORIF) due to repeated aspiration and barotrauma. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned slowly as her respiratory status allows. She will complete her course of antibiotics for VAP today. The goal is to diurese with a net loss of 1 liter today. 

The patient also has tachycardia, which appears partly mediated by anxiety. She is encouraged to have regular communication with an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter. Clonazepam has been increased to 1 mg, and the weaning of versed and fentanyl will continue as tolerated.

The patient exhibits anasarca, a combination of fluid overload and hypoalbuminemia. The plan is to diurese with a net loss of 1 liter today. The patient is malnourished, with enteral feeds now at goal and on a high-protein diet. Pre-albumin levels are pending, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement will be discussed once the patient's nutritional status improves. 

Other plans are mentioned in the housestaff note. In terms of ICU care,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The chief complaint is acute respiratory failure, and the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 105/63 to 154/91 mmHg, heart rate of 127 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,046 mL and output of 3,252 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -206 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PPS mode ventilation, set tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 26.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 11.8 to 15.8 thousand cells per microliter, anemia with hemoglobin (Hct) levels between 26.8 and 29.6 percent, thrombocytopenia with platelet (Plt) count of 46 thousand cells per microliter,"

   - lasix 10-20 mg IV for diuresis, goal -1L
   -will attempt PSV today.
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Month/Day/Year 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]

   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restarted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days, checking pre-albumin
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin;
   -[**Doctor First Name **] will hold off on PEG given low albumin.
   s/p hip fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness, admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization. She presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient had multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. She was treated for VAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. She also had septic shock likely due to a pulmonary etiology, improved with fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient had hemothorax, chest tube removal, and negative pleural fluid culture. She had a firm abdomen, possibly due to constipation, which resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. The patient had a hip fracture, wound healing well, and no signs of dislocation. She had tachycardia, likely anxiety-related, and edema possibly from extensive volume resuscitation. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, heparin, furosemide, klonopin, and lasix. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was treated for VAP, indicating a risk of pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation.
2. Septic shock: The patient had signs of septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can occur as a result of severe infection and inadequate oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled
   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure presented  with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension
   and ARDS.
    .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  s/p treatment of VAP
   with vanco, cefepime and cipro, ended on [**9-6**].
   - Plateau pressures stable in 20s
   - continuing to try to wean PS as possible
   - apneic at nighttime, and requiring MMV, likley due to metabolic
   alkalosis
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Month/Year (2) 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina to end today.
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] x 7 day course, started [**8-29**],
   finished 2 days ago.
   - foley catheter changed; resent urine cx
   - f/u pending cultures-NGTD
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube removed and pleural fluid cx with no growth
   thus far.
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx-NGTD
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restarted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days, checking pre-albumin
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin;
   -[**Doctor First Name **] will hold off on PEG given low albumin.
   s/p hip fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Very stimulus-dependent.
   - monitor on tele
   - boluses of sedation prn
   - start NG ativan to start weaning versed
   -resumed home clomipramine and will resume home dose klonapin today.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension and was diagnosed with ARDS.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient underwent tracheostomy and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is now stable with plateau pressures in the 20s, continuing to try to wean the peak inspiratory pressure (PS) as possible, apneic at nighttime, and requiring mandatory minute volume (MMV) due to metabolic alkalosis.
2. Septic Shock: The patient likely had pulmonary etiology given the diffuse infiltrates which worsened prior to MICU transfer. She significantly improved after fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, although the culture was without growth. Urine culture showed persistent C. [**Month/Year (2) 7706**]; renal ultrasound was negative for abscess. Blood cultures were negative. The patient is now off pressors.
3. Hemothorax: The patient had a chest tube placed and removed. Pleural fluid culture"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled
   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure presented  with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension
   and ARDS.
    .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  s/p treatment of VAP
   with vanco, cefepime and cipro, ended on [**9-6**].
   - Plateau pressures stable in 20s
   - continuing to try to wean PS as possible
   - apneic at nighttime, and requiring MMV, likley due to metabolic
   alkalosis
   .
   Metabolic Alkalosis: worsening since diuresis intitiated last few
   days.  VBG showing CO2 in the 70s, likely contributing to her apnea
   overnight.
   - holding lasix
   - starting acetazolamide for diuresis and try to reverse alkalosis
   .
   Tachycardia:
   .
   Nutrition: patient still with low albumin, prealbumin is 9.  Plan is to
   increase nutritional status prior to surgery to place PEG tube.
   Continue high protein tube feeds.  Can consider TPN in future if
   albumin not changing.
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Month/Year (2) 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]

   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restarted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days, checking pre-albumin
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin;
   -[**Doctor First Name **] will hold off on PEG given low albumin.
   s/p hip fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Very stimulus-dependent.

   recurrent aspiration, acute respiratory failure, PTX and hemothorax.
   s/p trach, recovering from VAP/ARDS. Her major issues include:
   1.       Acute respiratory failure: continue to require mechanical
   ventilation, though tolerating slow wean
             *Pt now on PS 8 ventilation, will continue to wean\
             *Remains volume overloaded, diuresis gently
   2.       Poor nutrition: Enteral feeds at goal. Will continue to assess
   nutritional status with goal of PEG placement when albumin adequate
   3.       Anxiety: she is now on her home regimen of clonazepam, and
   appears more alert on lower levels of sedation. Still on continuous
   infusions of midazolam and fentanyl which we will continue to decrease.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 35 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness who underwent ORIF and experienced recurrent aspiration, acute respiratory failure, PTX, and hemothorax. She has since undergone tracheostomy placement and is recovering from VAP/ARDS. The patient's current issues include acute respiratory failure, poor nutrition, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation and is being slowly weaned. She remains volume overloaded, and diuresis is being gently continued.
2. Poor Nutrition: Enteral feeds are at goal, but the patient's nutritional status needs ongoing assessment. The goal is to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube when albumin levels are adequate.
3. Anxiety: The patient is on her home regimen of clonazepam and appears more alert on lower levels of sedation. She is still on continuous infusions of midazolam and fentanyl, which will be gradually decreased.
4. Anasarca: The patient has fluid overload and hypoalbuminemia, leading to edema. Diuresis is planned to remove excess fluid, and 5% albumin may be used if needed.
5. Malnutrition: The patient requires high-protein tube feeds and her pre-albumin levels are low. An open PEG placement will be necessary once albumin levels exceed 2.0.
6. Constipation: A bowel regimen has been initiated.
7. Code Status: The patient has a full code status.
8. Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization. She presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, and was diagnosed with ARDS. The patient has undergone treatment for VAP and is now on mechanical ventilation. She also has metabolic alkalosis, which is contributing to her apnea at night. The patient's nutritional status is low, and there are plans to improve it before surgery. She also has anemia, likely due to abdominal pathology. Other issues include hemothorax, firm abdomen, and a hip fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's ARDS is improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. There may be a need for weaning off the ventilator and transitioning to a tracheostomy collar.

2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is worsening, which could contribute to her apnea at night. Holding diuretics and starting acetazolamide may help reverse the alkalosis.

3. Anemia: The patient has low hemoglobin levels, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or other sources.

4. Hemothorax: The patient previously had a hemothorax, but the chest tube has been removed, and the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG due to prolonged hospitalization complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.

The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, and was diagnosed with ARDS. She has since undergone a tracheostomy and treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her respiratory status is stable with plateau pressures in the 20s and efforts are being made to wean the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) as possible.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, which is worsening since diuretic initiation. This is likely contributing to her apnea overnight. Lasix has been held and acetazolamide started for diuresis and to reverse alkalosis.

The patient's tachycardia is likely due to anxiety. She is being monitored on tele, receiving boluses of sedation as needed, and starting on ativan to wean off versed. Her home medications, including clomipramine and klonapin, are being resumed.

Nutritionally, the patient has low albumin levels and prealbumin is 9. A plan is in place to increase nutritional status prior to surgery to place a PEG tube. High protein tube feeds are being continued, and consideration will be given to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization. The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation. The patient's metabolic alkalosis is worsening since the initiation of diuresis, and acetazolamide has been started to reverse the alkalosis.

The patient also has tachycardia, likely due to anxiety. Sedation is being administered as needed, and the patient is being weaned off midazolam (versed) with the addition of ativan. The patient's nutritional status is low, with low albumin levels, and plans are in place to improve this before proceeding with PEG tube placement.

The patient's past medical history includes septic shock, hemothorax, firm abdomen, and a hip fracture. The hip fracture is healing well, and there are no surgical issues. The patient's edema is likely due to extensive volume resuscitation, and diuretics are being used to manage this.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation (MR) and a history of recurrent respiratory failure following orthopedic surgery (ORIF). She has been in the ICU for an extended period due to aspiration and barotrauma. The patient has had a tracheostomy placement and is currently resolving ARDS/VAP. She is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) during the day and mandatory minute volume (MMV) at night. The plan is to down-titrate PSV to 8 or 6 and possibly trial extubation with a tracheal collar.

The patient's current medical issues include acute respiratory failure (VAP/ARDS resolving), metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis, tachycardia (possibly related to anxiety and anemia), anemia (possibly due to chronic disease), anasarca (fluid overload and hypoalbuminemia), and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure - The patient has been experiencing recurrent respiratory failure, which can be a life-threatening condition if not properly managed.
2. Metabolic alkalosis - This condition needs to be monitored and treated to prevent complications such as neuromuscular irritability, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
3. Tachycardia - The underlying cause of tachycardia needs to be addressed to prevent complications like increased oxygen demand, arrhythmias, and cardiac ischemia.
4. Anemia - If left untreated, anemia can lead to complications such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and decreased tissue perfusion.
5. Anasarca - Fluid overload and hypoalbuminemia can lead to complications such as edema, ascites, and poor wound healing.
6. Malnutrition - Poor nutritional status can result in complications such as delayed wound healing, infections, weakened immune system, and impaired organ function.

Please note that these are potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual complications and their severity may vary depending on various factors."

   resolving VAP/ARDS. Her major issues include:
   1. Acute respiratory failure/VAP/ARDS: remains ventilator dependent but
   slow improv
t this week. Briefly on  trach collar trial this morning.
   Will continue to attempt TC as tolerated, PSV otherwise. Has
   intermittently required MMV for apneic spells but this should hopefully
   decrease as her sedation is further weaned. Continue  to diurese.
   2. Malnutrtion: pt pulled out Dobhoff tube yesterday. Albumin improved
   but still borderline at 1.9. Spoke with thoracics- as Dobhoff placement
   was extremely difficult even under direct endoscopic guidance, will
   temporize with TPN. Tentatively for G-tube placement within the next
   wk.
   3. Agitation: improving, tolerating sedation wean.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 35 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with MR delay and recurrent respiratory failure, who underwent ORIF and developed ARDS/VAP. She is currently recovering and tolerating PSV by day and MMV by night. The patient's major issues include acute respiratory failure/VAP/ARDS, metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis, tachycardia, anemia, anasarca, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure/VAP/ARDS: The patient remains ventilator dependent but is showing slow improvement this week. There may be a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if she does not continue to improve.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis. If not properly managed, this could lead to complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is partly mediated by anxiety and possibly related to anemia. If left unaddressed, it could lead to complications such as increased cardiac workload, reduced blood flow to vital organs, and arrhythmias.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, possibly due to chronic disease or blood loss. If not treated appropriately, it could result in fatigue, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased risk of infection.
5. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, a combination of fluid overload and hypoalbuminemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. He has a history of fever, hypotension, and alteration in nutrition. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving TPN without lipids. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, increased body weight, and a balance of -938 mL in fluids. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypophosphatemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased secretions, and changes in oxygenation is essential.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability state can increase the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment for signs of DVT, such as leg swelling and pain, should be performed.
3. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of nosocomial infections. Monitoring for fever and other signs of infection is crucial.
4. Stress ulcer: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Close monitoring for symptoms like abdominal"

   .
   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled
   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure presented  with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension
   and ARDS.
    .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  s/p treatment of VAP
   with vanco, cefepime and cipro, ended on [**9-6**].
   - Plateau pressures stable in 20s
   - continuing to try to wean PS as possible
   - recently apneic at nighttime, and requiring MMV, likley due to
   metabolic alkalosis
   -attempt to keep on PSV today, with possibly wean to trach collar after
   lightening sedation.
   .
   Metabolic Alkalosis: worsening since diuresis intitiated last few
   days.  VBG showing CO2 in the 70s, likely contributing to her apnea
   overnight.
   - holding lasix
   - starting acetazolamide for diuresis and try to reverse alkalosis,
   will increased dose today given blood transfusion.
   ..
   Nutrition: patient still with low albumin, prealbumin is 9.  Plan is to
   increase nutritional status prior to surgery to place PEG tube.
   Continue high protein tube feeds.  Can consider TPN in future if
   albumin not changing.
   -will ask thoracics re: PEG today. If no plan, will need IR guided
   dobhoff and if no PO access will need to start TPN.
   .
   Anemia-no clear source of bleeding. Pt with recent abd pain, could be
   secondary to abd pathologyl.
   -continue [**Hospital1 **] HCt
   -access appropriate
   -T+S
   -transfuse 1 unit PRBCs.
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Hospital1 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina completed
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] x 7 day course, started [**8-29**],
   completed.
   - foley catheter changed; resent urine cx
   - f/u pending cultures-NGTD
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube removed and pleural fluid cx with no growth
   thus far.
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx-NGTD
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restarted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days, checking pre-albumin
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin;
   -[**Doctor First Name **] will hold off on PEG given low albumin.
   -increased bowel regimen, as no BM recently
   s/p hip fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Very stimulus-dependent.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization. The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, along with ARDS. The patient underwent treatment for VAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and cipro. Currently, the patient is on CPAP/PSV with a tracheostomy, and attempts are being made to wean PSV and potentially transition to a trach collar. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, likely contributing to nighttime apnea. Acetazolamide has been started for diuresis and to reverse alkalosis. The patient's nutrition is a concern, with low albumin levels, and plans are in place to improve nutritional status before surgery. Anemia is also present without a clear source of bleeding. The patient had a recent episode of septic shock, which is now improved after fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's hemothorax has resolved, and the chest tube has been removed. Other issues include a firm abdomen, likely secondary to abdominal pathology, and a history of hip fracture with no signs of dislocation. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, likely due to anxiety, and edema, which is being addressed with diuresis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and recurrent respiratory failure, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in the setting of repeated aspiration and barotrauma. She has since developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), both of which are now resolving. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) during the day and mandatory minute volume (MMV) at night while on a tracheostomy mask. She has completed an antibiotic course for VAP and continues diuresis, remaining 7 liters positive over her hospital stay. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis, leukocytosis, tachycardia, anemia, anasarca, and malnutrition. She is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure - The patient's resolving ARDS and VAP indicate improvement, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the patient develops further complications or does not continue to improve.
2. Metabolic alkalosis - The patient's diuresis has led to metabolic alkalosis, which may require ongoing management with medication"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation who has been admitted to the ICU due to recurrent respiratory failure following an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She has a history of repeated aspiration and barotrauma. The patient had tracheostomy placement and subsequently developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), which are now resolving. 

The patient is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) during the day and mandatory minute volume (MMV) at night. She is doing well on the tracheostomy mask, and sedation can be lightened. The left lung sounds rhonchorous, indicating some secretions present. Antibiotic therapy for VAP has been completed.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis, and acetazolamide has been prescribed to manage this condition. Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.5 is observed, which could be related to secretions on the left side or hemoconcentration. The patient's tachycardia appears partly mediated by anxiety and possibly related to anemia. 

Anemia has been identified without a source of bleeding, and the patient has received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Anasarca, a combination of fluid overload and hypoalbuminemia, is present, and the plan"

   respiratory failure presented  with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension
   and ARDS.
    .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  s/p treatment of VAP
   with vanco, cefepime and cipro, ended on [**9-6**].

   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors for over two weeks.
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina completed
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] x 7 day course, started [**8-29**],
   completed.
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube removed and pleural fluid cx with no growth
   thus far.
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx-NGTD
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. NGT not placed
   secondary to surgically created nasal passages.
   - patient having bowel movements
   - continue to monitor

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who was admitted to the ICU for a scheduled tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a prolonged hospitalization. She presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent tracheostomy and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is now off sedation and tolerating the tracheostomy mask well. She was recently apneic at night, but has improved since the resolution of metabolic alkalosis. She is still on the initial mask, and appropriate suctioning is being continued.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending upward, and her lungs sound coarse today. A chest X-ray is planned for this afternoon, and cultures will be obtained if there is a spike in temperature. Infection will continue to be monitored.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis has resolved after three days of diamox treatment. Diamox will be stopped today, and further diuresis will only be considered if the patient does not meet the goal of losing about -500 mL/day.

   - recently apneic at nighttime, but since alkalosis resolved has been
   tolerating trach mask all night
   -now off sedation, ativan boluses PRN because cannot take home oral
   meds
   -continue appropriate suctioning.

   - CXR this afternoon
   - culture if spikes, continue to monitor for other signs of infection
   .
   Metabolic Alkalosis:  resolved
   - responded to diamox treatment for three days

   about -500 a day.
   ..
   Nutrition: patient still with low albumin, prealbumin is 9.  Plan is to
   increase nutritional status prior to surgery to place PEG tube. Had to
   switch to TPN given no PO access.
   -awaiting thoracics placement of PEG tube next week.
   - continue TPN, appreciate nutrition recs
   - consider speech and swallow eval
   - no NG tube because of difficult nasal passages s/p reconstruction
   .
   Anemia-no clear source of bleeding. s/p 1 u PRBCs and Hct stable.

   -access appropriate
   -T+S
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors for over two weeks.

   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. NGT not placed
   secondary to surgically created nasal passages.
   - patient having bowel movements
   - continue to monitor
   s/p hip fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Very stimulus-dependent.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness who was admitted to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization. She presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension and was diagnosed with ARDS. 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and placement of a central line. She has also been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to lack of oral access.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is now off sedation and tolerating the tracheostomy mask well. However, she has coarse lung sounds, indicating possible ongoing lung issues. A chest X-ray was ordered, and cultures will be monitored for any signs of infection.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending upward, which could indicate an infection. Coarse lung sounds and the possibility of pneumonia should be considered.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's alkalosis has resolved after treatment with diamox. Diuretics will be continued unless there is no diuresis within the next few days.
4. Nutrition: The patient has low albumin levels, and prealbumin is 9. The plan is to increase nutritional status prior to surgery for PEG tube placement. T"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-8-25**] for scheduled
   tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization from [**2170-7-25**] to
   [**2169-8-25**] complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and
   respiratory failure presented  with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension
   and ARDS.
    .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy.  s/p treatment of VAP
   with vanco, cefepime and cipro, ended on [**9-6**].
   - currently on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 996**] mask
   - recently apneic at nighttime, and requiring MMV, likley due to
   metabolic alkalosis
   -continue to wean sedation, to bolus rather than gtt.
   -continue appropriate suctioning.
   .
   Metabolic Alkalosis:  since diuresis intitiated last few days.  VBG
   showing CO2 in the 70s, likely contributing to her apnea overnight.
   - holding lasix
   - started acetazolamide for diuresis and try to reverse alkalosis, last
   dose today.
   ..
   Nutrition: patient still with low albumin, prealbumin is 9.  Plan is to
   increase nutritional status prior to surgery to place PEG tube.
   Continue high protein tube feeds.  Had to switch to TPN given no PO
   access.
   -awaiting thoracics placement of PEG tube next week.
   .
   leukocytosis-no clear signs of infection. Has just completed tx for Uti
   and VAP. Will continue to monitor currently and trend fever curve.
   .
   Anemia-no clear source of bleeding. Pt with recent abd pain, could be
   secondary to abd pathology.
   -continue to monitor HCT.
   -access appropriate
   -T+S
   -transfused 1 unit PRBCs. Recently.
   s/p Septic Shock:  Likely pulm etiology given diffuse infiltrates which
   worsened prior to MICU transfer.  Now significantly improved s/p fluid
   resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics although cx without
   growth.  Urine with persistent C. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7706**]; renal ultrasound negative
   for abscess. Blood cultures negative. No diarrhea and C. diff
   negative.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF for urine output < 30 cc/hr, CVP < [**11-27**], MAP < 60, SVV < [**1-28**]
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for ventilator associated
   pneumonina completed
   - micafungin for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 474**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7706**] x 7 day course, started [**8-29**],
   completed.
   - foley catheter changed; resent urine cx
   - f/u pending cultures-NGTD
   Hemothorax:  Chest tube removed and pleural fluid cx with no growth
   thus far.
   - trend hematocrit daily
   - f/u pleural fluid cx-NGTD
   Firm abdomen: KUB without obstruction or ileus but appeared
   constipated; now resolved with aggressive bowel regimen. Tube feeds
   restarted and tolerating well.  NGT not placed secondary to surgically
   created nasal passages.
   - continue tube feeds
   - repeat albumin in several days, checking pre-albumin
   - PEG tube pending improved albumin;
   -[**Doctor First Name **] will hold off on PEG given low albumin.
   -increased bowel regimen, as no BM recently
   s/p hip fracture:  No signs of dislocation.  Wound healing well.  SICU
   team had obtained plain films of hip for assessment.  Hip films without
   evidence of misalignment.
   - per orthopedics no surgical issues
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Very stimulus-dependent.
   - monitor on tele
   - boluses of sedation prn
   - unable to get PO meds currently as without access
   -resumed home clomipramine and will resume home dose klonapin, no PO
   access currently.,
   .
   Edema-likely [**3-20**] extensive volume resuscitation. Now normotensive. Will
   diurese with plan for - 1L daily.
   -[**Hospital1 **] diamox for now, will plan to use lasix tomorrow for goal.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness who was transferred to the ICU for scheduled tracheostomy and PEG after a prolonged hospitalization complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. She presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension and was diagnosed with ARDS.

The patient is now post tracheostomy and has completed treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. She is currently on TPN due to no PO access and is being weaned off sedation. She is also on protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure/ARDS, metabolic alkalosis, nutrition, leukocytosis, anemia, septic shock, hemothorax, firm abdomen, s/p hip fracture, tachycardia, and edema. The potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, worsening of metabolic alkalosis, poor nutritional status, infection, bleeding, kidney issues related to septic shock, recurrent pleural effusion, abdominal pathology, joint dislocation, anxiety, and fluid overload.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and management plan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation who has had recurrent respiratory failure following an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. She has been on a tracheostomy (trach) mask and has shown improvement in her condition. The patient was previously diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), which are now resolving. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP and is tolerating tracheostomy well.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (103 bpm), but otherwise stable blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. The patient has gained weight since admission.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.1 K/uL, which is increasing. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient has an elevated TCO2 level of 36 and a glucose level of 174 mg/dL.

Plan:
1. Continue tracheostomy care and suctioning as needed.
2. Complete the course of antibiotics for VAP.
3. Slow down diuresis.
4. Discontinue acetazolamide and monitor I/O, aiming for a goal of 500cc today.
5. Check sputum, urine analysis (UA), and chest X-ray (CXR) now, and perform a blood culture if necessary.
6. Encourage regular communication"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation (MR) and a history of recurrent respiratory failure following an orthopedic surgery (ORIF) due to repeated aspiration and barotrauma. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and has developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Currently, her condition is resolving, and she is well-tolerating tracheostomy mask ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, increased body weight, positive fluid balance, and adequate oxygenation. Her respiratory support includes being on a tracheostomy mask with supplemental oxygen. There are diffuse rhonchi and thick secretions in her lungs, but no significant edema.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.1 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL, and slightly elevated platelet count of 711 K/uL. Blood gas analysis shows partial respiratory alkalosis. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute respiratory failure - VAP/ARDS resolving. The patient will continue with tracheostomy mask ventilation and lighten sedation as tolerated.
2. Metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis. Acetazolamide will be discontinued, and input/output monitoring will be done with a goal of 500cc output today.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 16-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple injuries from a motor vehicle accident.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/69 mmHg to 92/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient has received various medications including midazolam, heparin sodium, and TPN without lipids.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count.
- The patient has multiple injuries including fractures of the right and left lower extremities, rib fractures, and a head injury.
- The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score is 8/15.
- The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not associated with ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged intubation and immobility increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism ("

   Leukocytosis: WBC trending upward, lungs sound coarse today
   - CXR this afternoon
   - culture if spikes, continue to monitor for other signs of infection
   ..
   Nutrition: patient still with low albumin, prealbumin is 9.  Plan is to
   increase nutritional status prior to surgery to place PEG tube. Had to
   switch to TPN given no PO access.
   -awaiting thoracics placement of PEG tube next week.
   - continue TPN, appreciate nutrition recs
   - consider speech and swallow eval
   - no NG tube because of difficult nasal passages s/p reconstruction

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period due to pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. She is currently in the ICU and is now resolving her condition. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is tolerating tube feeding. However, she shows signs of new respiratory infection, such as rising white blood cell count and new infiltrate in the right lower lobe, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has leukocytosis and evidence of aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed new infiltrates in the right lower lobe and increased secretions, indicating a possible new episode of VAP. The treatment plan includes initiating vancomycin and cefepime, bronchoscopy, and pan culture.
2. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin levels have improved with tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). However, she needs a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for long-term nutrition support. The patient is awaiting surgery for PEG placement.
3. Hip fracture: The patient had a hip fracture six weeks ago, and her weight-bearing status needs to be clarified with her orthopedic surgeon.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to anxiety. It should be monitored closely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with congenital deafness, mental retardation, who underwent an ORIF surgery and experienced recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory failure. She was transferred to the ICU for consideration of tracheostomy and G-tube placement. Postoperatively, she developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Currently, she presents with leukocytosis, malnutrition, new infiltrate on CXR, hepatomegaly, and impaired functional status. The patient's medical history includes OCD and recent ORIF surgery. Her current plan includes bronchoscopy evaluation, G-tube placement, and resuming OCD medication once enteral access is established.

Potential Complications:
1. Infectious Complications: The patient has a history of VAP and ARDS, and currently shows signs of leukocytosis with a new infiltrate on CXR. This could indicate a new infection or atelectasis. Close monitoring for signs of worsening infection or sepsis is necessary.
2. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, as indicated by her low albumin level and impaired functional status. Proper nutrition support through TPN or enteral feeding should be continued to prevent further nutritional deficits.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had previous episodes of acute respiratory failure, which may recur due to her impaired airway clearance, balance, gait, muscle performance, and transfers. Monitoring her respiratory status"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with recurrent aspiration and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an oropharyngeal examination under general anesthesia (ORIF) and was transferred to the ICU for consideration of tracheostomy (trach) and gastric tube placement. The patient has a history of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), malnutrition, acute respiratory failure, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 140/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheal mask with 50% FiO2. The patient's physical examination reveals scattered rhonchi and decreased breath sounds at the left bases. Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and other abnormalities in electrolyte and kidney function tests. The patient's nutrition is currently being managed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but plans are in place for enteral feeding once a gastrostomy tube is placed. The patient's current medications include lorazepam and heparin for prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has been admitted to the ICU for a prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis, which is now resolving. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and is tolerating tube-feeding. However, she has developed new respiratory symptoms and a rising white blood cell count, suggesting a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also shows signs of aspiration and has a recent history of treating VAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. 

Additionally, the patient's nutritional status has improved with tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but she requires percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to her inability to access oral intake. The patient also has a history of hip fracture and is currently non-weight bearing, awaiting further guidance from her orthopedic surgeon. 

The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, lasix, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and various other antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include worsening respiratory failure, recurrent V"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has been hospitalized for a prolonged period due to complications from pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis, which are now resolving. The patient is awaiting percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient previously had ARDS but is now tolerating tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation for several days. However, there is a new development of rising white blood cell count (WBC) and a right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also shows signs of aspiration. Therefore, it is recommended to initiate vancomycin and cefepime, tailor antibiotic therapy based on bronchoscopy results, perform bronchoscopy today, and frequently suction the patient.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is trending upward. A pan culture should be done, and the most likely source of infection is VAP considering the RLL infiltrate, increasing secretions, and aspiration of secretions. Vancomycin and cefepime should be continued to cover VAP, and bronchoscopy should be performed today.
3. Nutrition: The patient's albumin levels have significantly improved with tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), although the patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness
   s/p hip fracture, with prolonged hospital stay complicated by
   pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis, now resolving.  Awaiting PEG placement.
   .
   Respiratory Failure/ARDS:  Now s/p tracheostomy and tolerating TCM for
   several days.    She is s/p treatment of VAP with vanco, cefepime and
   cipro which ended on [**9-6**], however, now with rising wbc and new RLL
   infiltrate suggesting of new VAP.  S&S eval shows patient is aspirating
   her secretions.  GPCs in sputum from two days ago.
   - continues to have cough and few rhonchi in RUL
   - leukoyctosis trending down today, no fever, bronch unremarkable
   - cont to monitor, could be secondary to pneumonitis
   - if febrile, would treat for VAP
   .
   Leukocytosis: WBC trending down now.  Will pan culture, but most likely
   source is VAP given RLL infiltrate, increasing secretions and
   aspiration of secretions
 culture on [**9-10**] of sputum had sparse
   oropharyngeal growth.  Urine was negative.
   - no abx for now, cont to trend WBC, monitor for fever
   ..
   Nutrition.  Albumin has significantly improved with tube feeds and TPN,
   though patient has had no PO access for several days.  Now has new PICC
   after she pulled it out on Sunday night.  She is in need of PEG, but is
   awaiting surgery.  Unable to replace NGT due to nasal reconstruction.
   -awaiting thoracics placement of PEG tube this week, scheduled for
   tomorrow afternoon
   - continue TPN, appreciate nutrition recs
   .
   S/p hip fracture.  Hip fracture was 6 weeks ago.  Currently NWB, but
   will need to clarify weight bearing status with her orthopedic surgeon.
   - clarify weight bearing status with ortho, has been called, should
   call back today
   - PT
   Tachycardia: Likely [**3-20**] anxiety. Overall is improving.
   - monitor on tele
   - ativan PRN
   .
   OCD/Anxiety: unable to get home meds because has no PO access.
   - ativan PRN, restart home meds after PEG tube placed

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who has been admitted to the ICU due to a hip fracture. She has had a prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. The patient is now resolving from these conditions but remains dependent on mechanical ventilation. She is scheduled for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient had ARDS previously and now presents with a new right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, suggesting a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is leukocytosis, cough, and rhonchi in the right upper lobe (RUL). Monitoring for fever and worsening respiratory symptoms is necessary. If febrile, treatment for VAP should be initiated.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a trending-down white blood cell (WBC) count. It is important to pan culture and closely monitor the WBC count. The source of leukocytosis is likely VAP given the RLL infiltrate, increasing secretions, and aspiration of secretions. Antibiotics may be considered if the patient becomes febrile or if the leukocytosis worsens.

3. Nutrition: The patient requires nutritional support due to her inability to take oral intake. Albumin levels have improved with tube"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and developmental delay who has had an operation (ORIF) and is currently in the ICU. She has a history of recurrent aspiration and respiratory failure, as well as resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and a tracheostomy was performed, but a gastric tube was not placed due to hepatomegaly and the need for an open procedure, along with poor nutrition. 

Current issues include leukocytosis, malnutrition, chronic respiratory failure, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) via a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and is awaiting open gastric tube placement. Her blood sugar levels are well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration and respiratory failure. It is important to closely monitor her respiratory status and ensure that her tracheostomy is functioning properly to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could indicate an infectious source. Further evaluation and follow-up cultures should be done to identify the cause of leukocytosis and determine if any additional treatment"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of congenital deafness, mental retardation, and post-operative complications. She was admitted to the ICU due to recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory failure. The patient underwent a tracheostomy but did not have a gastrostomy tube placed. She had a previous case of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.0 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 130/51 mmHg to 177/136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask. She is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging shows an unchanged chest X-ray, and microbiology results indicate sparse oropharyngeal flora in the sputum and negative urine cultures.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is concerning for an infectious source. No high-grade fevers were noted. She completed a course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia on September 6th. Further cultures should be obtained, and the trend of white blood cell count should be monitored.
2. Malnutrition"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has had a prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis, which are now resolving. The patient is awaiting percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure/ARDS, leukocytosis, potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tachycardia. She also has a history of hip fracture, OCD/anxiety, and is awaiting orthopedic consultation for weight-bearing status.

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving tracheostomy care with tolerating tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient is also on prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has pneumboots applied.

Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of new VAP, and potential infection due to the use of a PICC line. The patient's nutritional status is being addressed through tube feeds and TPN, as she is awaiting PEG placement.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has been in the ICU for a prolonged period of time due to a hip fracture, pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. The patient is now resolving from these conditions and awaiting a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient has recently undergone a tracheostomy and is tolerating tube feeding through a nasogastric tube (NGT). However, she is experiencing new right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, which suggests a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is also showing signs of aspiration, as indicated by the presence of gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in her sputum.

The patient's leukocyte count (WBC) is elevated, but it is trending down. There is no fever at this time, and her bronchial sounds are unremarkable. The healthcare team is monitoring her condition closely and considering the possibility of secondary pneumonitis. If the patient becomes febrile, treatment for VAP will be initiated.

The patient's nutrition has improved with the use of tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). However, she still requires a PEG tube due to her inability to take oral medications. The patient's hip fracture occurred six weeks ago, and she is currently non-weight bearing (NWB). The healthcare team needs to clarify the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who has had a prolonged hospital stay due to complications from pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. She is now recovering but still faces several medical complications. The patient has impaired aerobic capacity, airway clearance, balance, gait, knowledge, muscle performance, and transfers. She is awaiting a PEG placement for nutrition support. The patient's current medical problems include an alteration in nutrition, fever, hypotension, acute respiratory failure, and aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of VAP, including rising white blood cell count, new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, and sputum culture revealing oropharyngeal growth. Monitoring for fever and continuing to trend WBC levels is important. Pan culture has been ordered, and treatment for VAP may be necessary if the patient becomes febrile.
2. Aspiration: The patient is aspirating her secretions, which can lead to further respiratory infections. Monitoring for signs of aspiration and implementing appropriate interventions, such as proper head positioning and suctioning, is crucial.
3. Pneumonitis: The patient's cough and rhonchi in the right upper lobe could indicate pneumonitis. Continued monitoring and assessment for fever and worsening respiratory symptoms are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent an ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) procedure and experienced recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory failure. She has been intubated and tracheostomized, and her condition is resolving. The patient also has hepatomegaly and poor nutrition, precluding the simultaneous placement of a G-tube with tracheostomy. She has been on TPN (total parenteral nutrition) since the feeding tube was pulled out by the patient. The patient's current issues include malnutrition, acute respiratory failure (which has improved), anxiety, and post-ORIF status (weight-bearing status to be clarified with her orthopedic surgeon).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutrition and dependence on TPN indicate a risk of malnutrition, which can lead to weakened immune function, delayed wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infections.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has improved, there is still a risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further deterioration in lung function.
3. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety, which has improved but remains stimulus-dependent and associated with tachycardia, may contribute to increased stress levels and potential complications related to agitation or restlessness.
4. Post-ORIF Complications: Clarification of weight-bearing status with the orthopedic surgeon is necessary to assess the risk of complications related"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who has been in the ICU for a prolonged period of time due to a hip fracture. She has developed pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis, but is now resolving. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is tolerating tube feeding (TF) for several days. She previously had an infection of the lower respiratory tract (VAP) and received treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. However, she now shows signs of a new infection with leukocytosis and a new right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient also has impaired aerobic capacity, airway clearance, balance, gait, knowledge, muscle performance, and transfers. She has an alteration in nutrition, fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of previous VAP and is showing signs of a new infection with leukocytosis and a new right lower lobe infiltrate. It is important to monitor for fever and treat accordingly.
2. Aspiration: The patient is aspirating her secretions, which can lead to further respiratory infections. Monitoring and appropriate interventions should be done to prevent aspiration.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility. Pro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure/ARDS. She underwent a prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis, which is now resolving. The patient is awaiting PEG placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure/ARDS and is currently on tracheostomy with tolerating TCM. She continues to have cough and few rhonchi in RUL, leukocytosis that is trending down, and low-grade fever. This may be secondary to pneumonitis or VAP. Continuous respiratory monitoring and treatment for VAP if febrile are recommended.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Pan culture has been done, and the source is most likely VAP given RLL infiltrate, increasing secretions, and aspiration of secretions. Monitoring the WBC count and treating for VAP if necessary is advised.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level has improved with tube feeds and TPN, but she is awaiting PEG placement due to her inability to have PO access. She is in need of PEG, and the plan is to begin total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.
4. Hip Fracture: The patient had a hip"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period due to a hip fracture. She has developed complications including pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis, which are now resolving. The patient is awaiting PEG placement for nutrition. She has a tracheostomy and is on tube feeding and TPN. Her current issues include respiratory failure/ARDS, leukocytosis, altered nutrition, fever, hypotension, and OCD/anxiety. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has had previous episodes of respiratory failure and ARDS. There is a risk of recurrence, especially if there is aspiration of secretions or new VAP.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an ongoing infection, such as VAP or another source of infection.
3. Altered Nutrition: The patient requires PEG placement due to her inability to take oral intake. She also has an altered albumin level, indicating malnutrition.
4. Fever: The patient has had episodes of fever, which may suggest an underlying infection, such as VAP.
5. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis or other causes.
6. OCD/Anxiety: The patient has a history of OCD and anxiety, and these conditions may be exacerbated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who had a hip fracture 6 weeks ago. She has been in the ICU with a prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is tolerating tracheal tube feeding. She was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, which ended on [**9-6**]. However, the patient now shows signs of new VAP with rising white blood cell count and a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. She is also experiencing cough and rhonchi in the right upper lobe, suggesting pneumonitis or aspiration. The patient's leukocytosis is trending down, and cultures have been obtained. She has significantly improved albumin levels with tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but still requires percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to her inability to take oral intake for several days. The patient has had no PO access since [**9-6**], and her current PICC line was placed after she pulled out the previous one on Sunday night. The patient's orthopedic surgeon needs to clarify her weight-bearing status following the hip fracture. The patient is expected to undergo PEG placement today, as recommended by Dr. [**Last Name 91**]. She continues to require TPN and will need restart of home medications after PEG tube placement. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to anxiety and is improving. She also has a history of OCD/anxiety and is currently unable to access her home medications. The patient's code status is full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent orthopedic surgery and experienced postoperative complications, including recurrent aspiration leading to acute respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy and G-tube placement. The patient has been recovering in the ICU and has shown improvement in her respiratory status. She tolerated laparoscopic percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) without any problems. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. However, her creatinine level is elevated at 0.4 mg/dL. Imaging shows stable lung infiltrates with slight improvement. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple ongoing issues, including malnutrition, acute respiratory failure, anxiety, and a recent orthopedic surgery repair. The plan includes resuming tube feeds, discontinuing total parenteral nutrition (TPN), continuing trials for pressure mode ventilation (PMV), and resuming home medications for anxiety. Physical therapy and occupational therapy have been recommended due to the patient's spondylolisthesis with neurogenic bladder. The patient is expected to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility once cleared"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She has a history of recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory failure, and has undergone tracheostomy (trach) placement. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for malnutrition, acute respiratory failure, anxiety, and surgical complications from the ORIF. She is also receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malnutrition: The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to a previous feeding tube removal. It is important to monitor her nutritional status and ensure adequate intake to prevent further malnutrition.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation support. Monitoring her oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to prevent further respiratory complications.
3. Anxiety: The patient exhibits signs of anxiety and stimulus dependency. It is important to continue managing her anxiety symptoms to prevent exacerbation of her condition.
4. Surgical complications: The patient underwent ORIF surgery, and it is essential to monitor for any post-operative complications such as infection, bleeding, or wound dehiscence.
5. VAP: Although the patient has completed her course of antibiotics, she remains at risk for VAP due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and s"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, deafness, and recent hip fracture. She has been in the ICU for an extended period of time due to complications from pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. The patient is currently recovering and awaiting placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition.

The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, and her vital signs have shown tachycardia ranging from the 140s. She also has been having voluminous diarrhea, and stool samples have been sent for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) testing. Lasix was held due to the diarrhea, and fluid bolus was given. The patient's abdomen is distended, and she is tender on the left side.

The patient's respiratory status has improved since the placement of a tracheostomy and tolerance of tube feeding. However, there are still signs of respiratory failure with cough and rhonchi in the right upper lobe (RUL). The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. A sputum culture showed growth, suggesting an oropharyngeal source, and urine culture was negative.

The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count has been elevated but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who has been in the ICU for a prolonged period due to complications from a hip fracture, including pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. She recently underwent PEG placement. The patient is currently experiencing abdominal pain with guarding and tenderness, as well as tachycardia. A KUB showed ileus. Her vital signs are stable, but she has leukocytosis with an elevated WBC count. She is at risk for various complications such as obstruction, ileus, infection at the site of G-tube, or infectious diarrhea (possible C. diff). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Obstruction: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may indicate an obstruction in her gastrointestinal tract.
2. Ileus: The presence of ileus on KUB suggests a temporary cessation of bowel motility, which could contribute to her symptoms.
3. Infection at G-tube site: The patient's recent G-tube placement puts her at risk for infection at the site.
4. Infectious diarrhea (C. diff): Given her symptoms and the presence of voluminous diarrhea, there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection.
5. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has a history of ARDS and respiratory failure, and she is still dependent on TCM (tracheal continuous mechanical ventilation). She is at risk for further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45.5 kg, 60-inch female with a chief complaint of being s/p trach and G-tube. She tolerated tube feeds and was anxious about discharge, so the plan was made to go to [**Hospital 858**] tomorrow. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.1Â°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 139/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has been experiencing voluminous diarrhea since the night, and her stool was sent for C. diff. IV fluid bolus was given, and Lasix was held. She also started having significant abdominal pain associated with tachycardia to the 140s. She was tender on the left side of her abdomen and distended. KUB showed ileus, but no free air. Tube feeds were held, and the G-tube was placed to suction. Thoracics were notified. Tachycardia fell by 40 bpm with stopping tube feeds, putting the G-tube to suction, and removing the rectal tube. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Clostridium difficile infection due to the symptoms of voluminous diarrhea.
2. Abdominal distension and ileus which may lead to bowel obstruction or perforation.
3. Tachycardia and abdominal pain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and is currently experiencing recurrent aspiration/acute respiratory failure. She has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and laparoscopic percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is showing signs of ileus or early large bowel obstruction (LBO) this morning, likely related to the PEG placement. Her vital signs indicate tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. She has a history of diarrhea, which may be related to tube feeds post PEG, but it needs to be ruled out for Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection. The patient also has anxiety that is improving but remains stimulus-dependent. She is on non-potable (npo) status and her nutritional plan is being adjusted accordingly. The patient's s/p ORIF involves total body weight-bearing restrictions on the side of orthopedic repair for three months. She requires physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which may be due to ileus or early LBO. Further evaluation and monitoring are required.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has had increased frequency of diarrhea since yesterday evening. This could be related to tube feeds post PEG or a possible C diff infection. Antibiotic therapy may be necessary if there are signs of infection.

   recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory failure, VAP, resolving
   ARDS, now s/p trach and PEG. Enteral feeds started yesterday with
   development of ileus overnight. Appropriate placement of PEG confirmed.
   Degree of  presumed tenderness earlier this morning was concerning;
   however through sign language interpreter subsequently determined that
   the pt was only reporting a mild degree of tenderness. TF

   but at lower rate. Prior plans for discharge today therefore cancelled.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent an operation for orthopedic repair and subsequently experienced recurrent aspiration, acute respiratory failure, and required a tracheostomy. The patient also had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which are now resolving. Additionally, the patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

The patient's recent events include increased frequency of diarrhea yesterday evening, followed by increased abdominal pain and associated tachycardia last night. Oxycodone was given as needed, and morphine sulfate IV was administered in the evening with minimal relief. The patient also received 2 liters of IV fluids. Due to suspected ileus, tube feeds were stopped, and the PEG tube was temporarily put on wall suction. This morning, the patient is experiencing abdominal pain only.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.5Â°F), heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/52 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on tracheostomy mask. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight is currently 43 kg, and her height is 60 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,074 mL and output of 2,590 mL. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who had a hip fracture six weeks ago. She has been in the ICU with prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis, which are now resolving. The patient recently underwent PEG placement. She is currently experiencing abdominal pain, which is concerning given her recent surgery. She is at risk for obstruction, ileus, infection at the site of the G-tube, or infectious diarrhea (C. diff). The patient also has impaired respiratory function and has had treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her white blood cell count is elevated, indicating leukocytosis, and she had a low-grade fever overnight. She is also dealing with impaired nutrition and has been on tube feeds but is not tolerating them well. The patient has a history of OCD/anxiety and is on medication for it.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Abdominal pain and ileus: The patient's abdominal pain, along with the presence of ileus on KUB, suggests a potential complication related to her recent surgery. This could lead to further obstruction, infection, or the development of conditions like C. diff.

2. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has a history of ARDS and is still at risk for respiratory failure due to her impaired respiratory function and the ongoing risk of aspiration.

3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has been in the hospital for a prolonged period of time and has developed several complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis, which are now resolving. She recently underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient is currently experiencing abdominal pain, which is concerning given her recent surgery. The pain could be due to obstruction, ileus, infection at the site of the G-tube, or infectious diarrhea (such as Clostridium difficile). Serial abdominal exams should be performed, and tube feeds should be resumed cautiously. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis may be necessary if the abdominal pain worsens.

The patient also has respiratory failure/ARDS, for which she has undergone a tracheostomy and is tolerating tube feeding. She previously had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient is still at risk of aspiration due to her condition. Continuous tube feeding and avoidance of oral intake should be continued.

There is leukocytosis with no clear source of infection. The patient had a low-grade fever overnight, and urinalysis and urine culture should be performed. Tests for Clostridium difficile and follow-up cultures should also be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has been in the ICU due to complications from a hip fracture, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. The patient recently underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient developed significant abdominal tenderness with guarding overnight after reaching tube feed rate of 40 (goal = 50). Her heart rate was in the 140s, and a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) scan showed ileus. Morphine was given for pain relief, and tube feeds were temporarily stopped. The patient's heart rate and abdominal pain improved since then. Abdominal pain is concerning due to recent surgery; the patient is at risk for obstruction, ileus, infection at the G-tube site, or infectious diarrhea (possibly Clostridium difficile). Pain improved and C. difficile was negative, so it was likely post-operative pain. The patient is now tolerating tube feeds at goal.

Further plans include serial abdominal exams, considering KUB or CT abdomen/pelvis if worsening abdominal pain occurs, thoracics following, and per thoracics if necessary. The patient's pain has improved, and oxycodone will be used for pain control with continued bowel regimen.

The patient also has transaminitis, which is unclear in etiology. It could be secondary to total parenteral"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with congenital deafness and mental retardation. She has been admitted multiple times and has a complex medical history, including a hip fracture, recurrent aspiration, persistent respiratory failure, presumed barotrauma-related pneumothorax and hemothorax, tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock.

The patient's current condition is stable on a tracheostomy collar after undergoing a laparoscopic PEG procedure. She is expected to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility once she can tolerate tube feeds. However, she is currently experiencing some ileus.

Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/68 mmHg to 162/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask.

Her laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes. However, her albumin level is slightly low at 2.8 g/dL.

The patient's medical complications include impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She was admitted to the ICU for a hip fracture and has since developed pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis, which are now resolving. The patient had a prolonged hospital stay, resulting in an ileus after gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placement. She is currently tolerating tube feeds well. The patient also has transaminitis with unclear etiology, possible secondary to total parenteral nutrition (TPN), although it would be unusual after only about a week or so of TPN. RUQ shows evidence of chronic liver disease, but no cholecystitis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has had treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is a concern for aspiration, so oral intake is restricted. The patient's white blood cell count is stable and trending down. She is scheduled for rehabilitation and will need to be reassessed for rehabs as her bed was lost this Friday. The patient's hip fracture occurred six weeks ago, and she is currently touch-down weight-bearing for three months post-op. The patient has a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety, for which she is receiving medication. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient developed ileus post G-tube placement. It is important to continue monitoring abdominal exams and ensure that tube feeds are tolerated without"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, deafness, and recent hip fracture. She has been in the ICU due to complications from pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis, which are now resolving. She underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on 9/13. The patient developed ileus post G-tube placement but is now tolerating tube feeds well. She tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). 

The patient's liver function tests show transaminitis with unclear etiology. An abdominal ultrasound reveals contracted gallbladder, heterogeneous and coarsened liver texture suggestive of chronic liver disease, and right pleural effusion. No obvious cause for the elevated liver enzymes was found, so a repeat ultrasound was ordered. The patient's tube feeds were held to allow for the repeat study. 

The patient has been on respiratory support and is now tolerating tracheostomy and timed cough mandatory (TCM) ventilation for over a week. She was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, which ended on 9/6. The patient is at high risk for aspiration, so oral intake has been withheld. 

Her white blood cell count has been stably elevated with no clear source of infection and is trending down. The patient had a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and gastrostomy tube (g-tube) placement. The patient's pain has improved, and they are receiving oxycodone as needed.

A transaminitis was discovered during abdominal pain evaluation, with no apparent cause identified. A right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ US) was ordered, revealing contracted gallbladder, heterogeneous and coarsened liver echo texture suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease, and right pleural effusion. The tube feeds were held temporarily due to these findings but were later resumed at goal.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (99Â°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/77 mmHg to 170/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 45.5 kg at admission to 43 kg currently.

The patient is receiving various medications, including lansoprazole and lorazepam, and is also on other ICU medications. The patient's allergies are noted, and no known drug allergies are reported.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the transaminitis finding. The patient's flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with mental retardation and deafness who has been admitted to the ICU for a prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. She underwent a PEG placement on 9/13 and has since developed ileus, but is now tolerating tube feeds well. Her transaminase levels are elevated, possibly due to TPN, and an ultrasound showed evidence of chronic liver disease. She is also experiencing respiratory failure/ARDS, for which she has undergone a tracheostomy and is tolerating TCM. She has been treated for VAP and has shown improvement. She also has leukocytosis with no clear source of infection. The patient's hip fracture occurred 6 weeks ago, and she is currently touch down weight bearing for 3 months post-op. She has a history of OCD/anxiety and is being treated with clonazepam and clomipramine. She is also experiencing tachycardia without clear signs of anxiety, pain, or dehydration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient developed ileus post G-tube placement but is currently tolerating tube feeds well. Close monitoring of bowel movements and abdominal exams will be necessary.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminase levels are elevated, and the cause is unclear. Possible secondary to TPN, although it would be unusual after only about a week or so of T"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who has been in the ICU for a prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. She underwent a PEG placement on [**9-13**] and developed ileus post G-tube placement. The patient is now tolerating tube feeds well at goal, with a negative C. diff test.

The patient's transaminase levels are elevated, with unclear etiology. The RUQ shows evidence of chronic liver disease, but no cholecystitis. The patient's respiratory status has improved since the treatment of VAP with vanco, cefepime, and cipro, which ended on [**9-6**]. She is now s/p tracheostomy and tolerating TCM for > 1 week. She is at risk for aspiration, so oral intake is restricted.

The patient has leukocytosis with a stable WBC count trending down today. She had a low-grade fever three nights ago but is now afebrile. The patient underwent hip fracture surgery 6 weeks ago and is currently touch down weight bearing for 3 months post op. She is being treated for OCD/anxiety with klonipin and clomipramine.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Fibersource HN (Full) at 49.[**Telephone/Fax (3) 8082**] mL/hour, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has a PICC line placed on [**2169-9-11**] 05:32 PM. Prophylaxis is being given for DVT with boots and SQ UF Heparin, as well as stress ulcer with PPI. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has been in the ICU due to complications from a hip fracture, including pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. The patient underwent PEG placement on 9/13 and developed ileus post G-tube placement but is now tolerating tube feeds well at goal. C. diff negative.

Assessment and plan:
1. Ileus: Continue tube feeds, serial abdominal exams, and thoracics following.
2. Transaminitis: Trend transaminases.
3. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: Continue TCM, no oral intake given aspiration risk is high, and continue PMV trials at rehab.
4. Leukocytosis: Follow-up WBC and fever curve.
5. Nutrition: Continue tube feeds.
6. S/p hip fracture: Touch down weight bearing for 3 months post-op.
7. OCD/Anxiety: Continue klonipin & clomipramine.
8. ICU Care: Nutrition - Fibersource HN (Full) at 49 mL/hour, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines - PICC Line, prophylaxis - DVT (boots, SQ UF Heparin), stress ulcer - PPI, VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's risk of aspirating secretions.
2. Liver disease or dysfunction indicated by RUQ findings.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to ileus or other factors.
6. Further complications related to the hip fracture, such as nonunion or avascular necrosis.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other potential complications that can arise in this patient's case."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has been in the ICU for an extended period of time due to complications from a hip fracture, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. She recently underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient developed significant abdominal tenderness overnight after reaching her goal tube feed rate, along with tachycardia. A kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) ultrasound showed ileus, so tube feeds were held. The patient's pain improved, and she is now tolerating tube feeds at goal. There are concerns regarding possible obstruction, ileus, infection at the site of the gastrostomy tube, or infectious diarrhea (Clostridium difficile). The patient's transaminitis has unclear etiology, possibly secondary to total parenteral nutrition (TPN), although it would be unusual after only about a week or so of TPN. A right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound was ordered to further evaluate this condition. The patient has a history of respiratory failure/ARDS, now post tracheostomy and tolerating intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) for over a week. She was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, which ended on September 6th. The patient continues to be at"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old individual with several medical issues. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and other complications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/73 to 170/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient's weight is currently 43 kg.

The patient has been receiving various medications and infusions, including lorazepam, lansoprazole, and other medications like chlomipramine, clonapin, senna, colace, and lanoprazole.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results indicate abnormal levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and blood glucose.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are thin, with no rashes or skin abnormalities. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and warm skin. The patient has muscle wasting and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

The patient's medical history includes several problems, such as impaired aerobic capacity, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, and impaired transfers. The patient also has a problem of alteration in nutrition, fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's current plan includes continuing temperature control, maintaining ileus improvement, monitoring abdominal pain, managing stress ulcers, providing deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and maintaining glycemic control. The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential medical complications that can arise include pneumonia due to impaired airway clearance, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and hypotension, further decline in respiratory function leading to respiratory failure, and pressure ulcers due to immobility.

Please note that the above summary and potential complications are based on the provided information and may not cover all aspects of the patient's condition. It is essential to consult with the patient's healthcare team for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate management."

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1516**]
s note above and
   agree with her findings and plan of care.  The patient is not easy to
   communicate with but expresses no  distress or pain. Her GI tract seems
   to be functioning well now, with PEG nicely in place.  Lungs clear with
   trache also without inflammation at stoma.  I would think she is ready
   to be evaluated for transfer to rehab.  I would advise her staying in
   MICU till such transfer, given the difficulties in communicating with
   pt and the long complicated course she has had already.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She has had a hip fracture, prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis, and recently underwent PEG placement with resolving ileus.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Ileus: The patient developed ileus post G-tube placement but is now tolerating tube feeds well at goal, and C. diff negative. The plan is to continue tube feeds, perform serial abdominal exams, and follow up with thoracics.

2. Transaminitis: The patient has unclear etiology transaminitis, possibly secondary to TPN. Although it would be unusual after only about a week or so of TPN, there is evidence of chronic liver disease. The plan is to trend transaminases and follow up with a [**Name (NI)**] sono in 6 weeks.

3. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has now undergone tracheostomy and tolerating TCM for > 1 week. She was treated for VAP with vanco, cefepime, and cipro, which ended on [**9-6**]. The patient shows signs of aspiration of her secretions, but her CXR is overall improving. The plan is to continue TCM, no oral intake given the high aspiration risk, and continue PMV trials at rehab.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has stable elevated WBC with no clear source of infection, trending down today. She had a low-grade fever three nights ago but is now afebrile. The plan is to follow up with WBC and fever curve.

5. Nutrition: The patient has undergone G-tube placement and will continue with tube feeds.

6. S/p Hip Fracture: The patient's hip fracture occurred six weeks ago. She is currently touch down weight bearing for 3 months post-op. The plan is to follow up with PT.

7. OCD/Anxiety: The patient will continue with Klonopin and Clomipramine.

8. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has worsened over the past few days without clear signs of anxiety, pain, or dehydration. The plan is to administer prn Ativan for anxiety, aim for Is=Os as the patient appears euvolemic, and monitor with telemetry.

It is important to note that these are just summaries of the patient's conditions and potential complications based on the provided information. A thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate assessment and appropriate management of the patient."

","Summary:
The patient is a 17-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint due to a language barrier. The patient has been receiving multiple infusions and medications, including Lansoprazole and Lorazepam. Vital signs show a fever, elevated heart rate, and slightly high blood pressure. The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy mask and has an oxygen saturation of 98%. Fluid balance shows an overall positive balance of 62 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since September 12th and remains on sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of an infection. Sepsis can be a serious complication in critically ill patients.
2. Bleeding: The low platelet count may indicate a risk of bleeding. This is particularly concerning if the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy or has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
3. Organ dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests and low hemoglobin levels may indicate potential organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of these parameters is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of respiratory infection is crucial.

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness, who had a hip fracture and prolonged hospital stay complicated by pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. She is now resolving from these conditions and has undergone PEG placement.
- The patient developed ileus post G-tube placement but is now tolerating tube feeds well at goal and tested negative for C. diff.
- She has transaminitis with unclear etiology, possibly secondary to TPN. Further follow-up of transaminases and liver ultrasound is needed.
- The patient has a history of respiratory failure/ARDS and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She underwent tracheostomy and has been tolerating TCM for over a week. She is still at risk for aspiration and her CXR is improving.
- She has leukocytosis with no clear source of infection, which is trending down. She had a low-grade fever three nights ago but is now afebrile.
- The patient has been nutritionally supported with G-tube placement.
- She had a hip fracture six weeks ago and is currently touch-down weight-bearing for three months post-op.
- She has OCD/anxiety and is being treated with clonazepam and clomipramine.
- The patient has worsening tachycardia over the past few days without clear signs of anxiety, pain, or dehydration.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and deafness. She had a hip fracture six weeks ago and has been in the hospital for a prolonged period of time. The patient has been complicated by pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), sepsis, ileus, transaminitis (liver inflammation), respiratory failure/ARDS, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), and tachycardia (rapid heart rate). The patient underwent procedures such as a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placement, tracheostomy, and G-tube placement. She is currently receiving tube feeds and is tolerating them well. The patient's current medications include lansoprazole, lorazepam, clonazepam, and clomipramine. She is also on prophylactic medications for DVT (deep vein thrombosis), pneumoboots, and stress ulcer. The patient's recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes, but her other lab values are within normal range. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, high heart rate, and stable blood pressure. The patient's respiratory status is improving, as shown by the improvement in her chest x-ray. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is rehab.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and pneumothorax. Although her pulmonary issues have resolved, there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if proper tracheostomy care and weaning from mechanical ventilation are not managed appropriately.
2. Malnutrition: The patient has undergone laparoscopic PEG and is receiving tube feeds. However, she may still be at risk for malnutrition due to her long hospitalization and potential difficulty with oral intake. Continuous assessments for nutritional status and possible swallow evaluations should be conducted.
3. Deconditioning: The patient's prolonged hospitalization may lead to deconditioning, which can affect her overall physical function and recovery. Physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) should be initiated to prevent deconditioning and promote rehabilitation.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old woman with congenital deafness and mental retardation.
- She had a tracheostomy on 08/28 for aspiration pneumonia and pneumothorax, leading to chronic respiratory failure.
- She was transferred to Hospital 1 on 08/28 for ARDS and septic shock, which are now resolved.
- She underwent a laparoscopic percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on 09/13 and is doing well.
- The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, malnutrition, and deconditioning due to long hospitalization.
- The plan includes continuing tube feeds, assessing for potential decannulation, physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), and rehabilitation at Hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient still requires respiratory support through a tracheostomy collar with pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV). There is a possibility of downsizing the ventilator settings or considering decannulation if the patient tolerates it.
2. Malnutrition: The patient had a laparoscopic PEG on 09/13 and is currently receiving tube feeds. Continuous assessments for oral intake and swallow evaluations will be conducted.
3. Deconditioning: Due to the long hospitalization, the patient may benefit from PT/OT to address muscle weakness and loss of function.
4. Potential Infections: Although the patient's ARDS and septic shock have"
