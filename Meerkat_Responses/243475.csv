   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 70 yo female with known COPD presents with neasea, vomiting likely
   secondary to SBO, as well as pulmonary infact in the setting of
   polycythemia.
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: Etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]-abdominal hernia has
   been described to cause this; alternatively, an ischemic event in the
   bowel, perhaps mediated by the pt's polycythemia, could also be a
   potential trigger.
   - appreciate surgical input
   - NGT tube
   - liberal volume repletion, although will hold further IV fluids for
   now given vigerous repletion already performed in ED
   - NPO
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   # Polycythemia: Pt with long-standing high-normal red cell mass.
   Suspect that current increase in red cell concentration is likely
   multifactorial, occuring in the setting of heavy tobacco use, probably
   dehydration and, most likely, a myloproliferative disorder. Pt's
   history of a JAK2 mutation makes the later even more likely.
   - serial HCTs
   - IV fluids as above
   - ASA (rectal while NPO)
   - phlebotomy as directed per hematology
   - appreciate ongoing hematology input
   - check epo level
   # Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial in the setting of acute illness,
   probable pulmonary edema, moderate respiratory distress, and pulmonary
   infarct. For now, will attempt to control via symptom relief (careful
   volume managment, bronchodilators, pain control) and will trend
   closely. Low threshold for further evaluation, such as pulmonary CTA,
   if no improvement.
   # Hypoxia: Suspected pulmonary infarct likely secondary to increased
   red cell mass. Likely also with component from COPD. [**Month (only) 60**] also Pt does
   not have LE swelling to suggest a peripheral venous source for PE.
   - Assess reponse to lasix, may need to consider intubation if
   respiratory status does not improve
   - Will need to monitor respiratory status closely in the setting of
   acute illness and volume repletion. Continue home albuterol and
   ipratropium nebs.
   - Consider imaging of pulmonary vasculature if deterioration
   # Bipolar Disorder: Will need to hold outpt psychiatric medication in
   setting of SBO. Can use IV haldol judiciously if needed, however do not
   anticipate this will be necessary at the [**Last Name (un) **].

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with known COPD who presents with nausea, vomiting likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as pulmonary infarction in the setting of polycythemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Nausea/vomiting/SBO: The etiology of the SBO in this patient without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. It could be due to an abdominal hernia or an ischemic event in the bowel, potentially mediated by the patient's polycythemia. 

2. Polycythemia: The patient has a long-standing high-normal red cell mass, which may be multifactorial and occur in the setting of heavy tobacco use, dehydration, and possibly a myeloproliferative disorder. The presence of a JAK2 mutation makes a myeloproliferative disorder more likely.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial and may be related to acute illness, probable pulmonary edema, moderate respiratory distress, and pulmonary infarct. Symptom relief and careful volume management are currently being attempted, along with close monitoring. Further evaluation, such as a pulmonary CT angiogram, may be necessary if there is no improvement.

4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is suspected to be due to a pulmonary infarct likely secondary to increased red cell mass. It is also likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 70 yo female with known COPD presents with neasea, vomiting likely
   secondary to SBO, as well as pulmonary infact in the setting of
   polycythemia.
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: Etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]-abdominal hernia has
   been described to cause this; alternatively, an ischemic event in the
   bowel, perhaps mediated by the pt's polycythemia, could also be a
   potential trigger.
   - appreciate surgical input
   - NGT tube
   - liberal volume repletion, although will hold further IV fluids for
   now given vigerous repletion already performed in ED
   - NPO
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   # Polycythemia: Pt with long-standing high-normal red cell mass.
   Suspect that current increase in red cell concentration is likely
   multifactorial, occuring in the setting of heavy tobacco use, probably
   dehydration and, most likely, a myloproliferative disorder. Pt's
   history of a JAK2 mutation makes the later even more likely.
   - serial HCTs
   - IV fluids as above
   - ASA (rectal while NPO)
   - phlebotomy as directed per hematology
   - appreciate ongoing hematology input
   - check epo level
   # Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial in the setting of acute illness,
   probable pulmonary edema, moderate respiratory distress, and pulmonary
   infarct. For now, will attempt to control via symptom relief (careful
   volume managment, bronchodilators, pain control) and will trend
   closely. Low threshold for further evaluation, such as pulmonary CTA,
   if no improvement.
   # Suspected pulmonary infarct: Likely secondary to increased red cell
   mass. Pt does not have LE swelling to suggest a peripheral venous
   source for PE. Would monitor pt's clinical status closely and consider
   imaging of pulmonary vasculature if deterioration.
   # COPD: Will need to monitor respiratory status closely in the setting
   of acute illness and volume repletion. Continue home albuterol and
   ipratropium nebs.
   # Bipolar Disorder: Will need to hold outpt psychiatric medication in
   setting of SBO. Can use IV haldol judiciously if needed, however do not
   anticipate this will be necessary at the [**Last Name (un) **].

   71 yo female with h/o COPD and MR now admit with SBO after presentation
   with nausea and vomiting.  During ED evaluation significant elevation
   of HCT seen and patient with bandemia noted but minimal evidence of
   focal source of infection.  In the setting of significant hydration
   patient has evolved some significant worsening of oxygenation and
   suggestion of pulmonary edema.

   -NPO
   -Follow exam
   -KUB for any acute chagnes
   2)Polycythemia-Do not have clear evidence as to source of persistent
   hypoxemia to drive elevation of RBC counts

   -ASA
   -Hydrate as possible
   -Heme to continue to follow and continue to discuss possibility of
   hydrea

   3)Hypoxemia-There is question raised as to pulmonary embolism on CT
   scan initially and hypoxemia seen now in the setting of volume overload
   and inaddition patient now has pleural effusion and possible pulmonary
   infiltrates.
   -Follow up pulmonary imaging and exam to determine need for any further
   diuresis as non-invasive ventilation not reasonable.
   -Vanco/Zosyn to continue
   -Will need dedicated scan to evaluate for PE as the findings on CT scan
   are concerning, she does have suggestion of increased right hilar
   fullness which may represent venous congestion, she does have hypoxemia
   with alternative contribution from pulmonary edema
but given all these
   findings would
   -Check LENI
   -Check CTA for possible PE
   4)Bandemia
is concerning for possible source of infection but patient
   with no evidence of clear sputum/cough/fever although there are
   pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and CT scan.
   -Vanco/Flagyl
given and will continue and look to determine focal
   source of infection but for now treating as pneumonia
   -Continue to Rx for SBO as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of COPD and MR who was admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO). She presented with nausea and vomiting, and during her evaluation, there was a significant elevation of hematocrit (HCT) and bandemia noted, but minimal evidence of a focal source of infection. The patient also has worsening oxygenation and suggestion of pulmonary edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has SBO, and a surgical consultation is in place. The plan includes NGT to suction, NPO, follow-up exam, and KUB for any acute changes. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of bowel ischemia or perforation, which can lead to sepsis and require immediate surgical intervention.

2. Polycythemia: The patient has polycythemia, but the source of persistent hypoxemia is not clear. A heme consultation has been ordered to further evaluate and discuss the possibility of using hydrea to reduce the hematocrit level. Monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation and considering oxygen therapy may be necessary to prevent further hypoxemia.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia could be due to pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary edema, or a combination of both. Further imaging studies, such as a dedicated scan or CT"

   multifactorial, occuring in the setting of heavy tobacco use, probably
   dehydration and, most likely, a myloproliferative disorder. Pt's
   history of a JAK2 mutation makes the later even more likely.

   - IV fluids as above
   - ASA (rectal while NPO)
   - phlebotomy as directed per hematology
   - appreciate ongoing hematology input
   - check epo level
   # Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial in the setting of acute illness,
   probable pulmonary edema, moderate respiratory distress, and pulmonary
   infarct. For now, will attempt to control via symptom relief (careful
   volume managment, bronchodilators, pain control) and will trend
   closely. Low threshold for further evaluation, such as pulmonary CTA,
   if no improvement.
   # Hypoxia: Suspected pulmonary infarct likely secondary to increased
   red cell mass. Likely also with component from COPD. [**Month (only) 60**] also Pt does
   not have LE swelling to suggest a peripheral venous source for PE.
   - Assess reponse to lasix, may need to consider intubation if
   respiratory status does not improve
   - Will need to monitor respiratory status closely in the setting of
   acute illness and volume repletion. Continue home albuterol and
   ipratropium nebs.
   - Consider imaging of pulmonary vasculature if deterioration
   # Bipolar Disorder: Will need to hold outpt psychiatric medication in

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with known COPD who presents with nausea, vomiting likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as pulmonary infarct in the setting of polycythemia. The patient also has a history of heavy tobacco use, probable dehydration, and a myeloproliferative disorder, which is supported by the presence of a JAK2 mutation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Nausea/Vomiting/SBO: The etiology of SBO in this patient without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. Possible triggers include abdominal hernia or an ischemic event in the bowel, potentially mediated by the patient's polycythemia. Close monitoring of the patient's abdominal exam and relevant lab values such as WBC, K, Cr, and lactate is important. Surgical input may be required.

2. Polycythemia: The patient has a long-standing high-normal red cell mass, which is likely multifactorial, occurring in the setting of heavy tobacco use, probable dehydration, and a myeloproliferative disorder. Serial HCTs, IV fluids, ASA (rectal while NPO), phlebotomy as directed per hematology, and ongoing hematology input are recommended. Checking epo levels is also important.

   - NPO
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as

   # Polycythemia: Pt with long-standing high-normal red cell mass.
   Suspect that current increase in red cell concentration is likely
   multifactorial, occuring in the setting of heavy tobacco use, probably
   dehydration and, most likely, a myloproliferative disorder. Pt's
   history of a JAK2 mutation makes the later even more likely.
   - serial HCTs
   - IV fluids as above
   - ASA (rectal while NPO)
   - phlebotomy as directed per hematology
   - appreciate ongoing hematology input
   - check epo level
   # Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial in the setting of acute illness,
   probable pulmonary edema, moderate respiratory distress, and pulmonary
   infarct. For now, will attempt to control via symptom relief (careful
   volume managment, bronchodilators, pain control) and will trend
   closely. Low threshold for further evaluation, such as pulmonary CTA,
   if no improvement.
   # Hypoxia: Suspected pulmonary infarct likely secondary to increased
   red cell mass. Likely also with component from COPD. [**Month (only) 60**] also Pt does
   not have LE swelling to suggest a peripheral venous source for PE.
   - Assess reponse to lasix, may need to consider intubation if
   respiratory status does not improve
   - Will need to monitor respiratory status closely in the setting of
   acute illness and volume repletion. Continue home albuterol and
   ipratropium nebs.
   - Consider imaging of pulmonary vasculature if deterioration
   # Bipolar Disorder: Will need to hold outpt psychiatric medication in
   setting of SBO. Can use IV haldol judiciously if needed, however do not
   anticipate this will be necessary at the [**Last Name (un) **].

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with known COPD who was admitted to the ICU due to nausea, vomiting, and suspected small bowel obstruction (SBO). She also has signs of pulmonary infarction in the setting of polycythemia.

The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with various interventions and assessments carried out. The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Nausea/vomiting/SBO: The etiology of the SBO is unclear, with possibilities including an abdominal hernia or an ischemic event in the bowel, potentially mediated by the patient's polycythemia. Surgical input is appreciated, and the patient has been placed on NPO status with an NGT tube inserted. Liberal volume repletion is recommended, although further IV fluids will be held for now. Close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate, and abdominal exam trends is advised.

2. Polycythemia: The patient has a long-standing high-normal red cell mass, which is suspected to be multifactorial. Heavy tobacco use, dehydration, and a myeloproliferative disorder are likely contributing factors. The patient's history of a JAK2 mutation makes a myeloproliferative disorder even more likely. Serial HCTs, IV fluids, ASA (rectal while NPO), phlebotomy as directed by hematology,"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo with COPD and initial presentation with SBO who was found to have
   polycythemia.  Upon further history it does appear that patient has had
   long standing hypoxemia and O2 requirement at home which she may not
   have been fully supported with O2 which may in large part contributing
   to elevation in HCT.  Now she has severe compromise in regards to both
   oxygenation and ventilation.  This may well be driven by the large
   bilateral LL consolidations with minimal effusions.  In that setting
   patient has had some worsening of vd/Vt with consolidation of the lower
   lobes and exclusive use of the upper lobes.  This may account for
   moving to position of severe compromise of ventilation and perfusion
   until LL consolidations are improved.  This will have to be pursued
   through aggressive chest PT, [**Name (NI) **], suctioning.  In terms of support
   BIPAP would be concerning as modality given need to secretion
   clearance, patient compliance will be limited and concern for
   aerophagia is significnat with SBO.

","The patient is a 71-year-old with a history of COPD and acute exacerbation, who presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO). They have been diagnosed with polycythemia due to long-standing hypoxemia and O2 requirement at home. The patient's current condition is severe compromise in regards to both oxygenation and ventilation, driven by large bilateral lower lobe (LL) consolidations with minimal effusions. This has resulted in worsening of ventilation-perfusion mismatch until LL consolidations are improved. The patient will require aggressive chest physical therapy (PT), suctioning, and alternative respiratory support due to concerns about modality given need for secretion clearance, limited patient compliance, and significant concern for aerophagia associated with SBO.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure - Secondary to the above factors, the patient may experience respiratory failure, which will be attempted to be managed with invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) across the day. If there is progression, intubation may be necessary.
2. Infection - The patient is currently on Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for infection, indicating a potential risk of infection.
3. Volume Status - The patient's volume status is tenuous and needs to be closely monitored.
4. Enteric Fever - Given the small bowel obstruction, there is a possibility of enteric fever or other gastrointestinal complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of COPD who presented with nausea, vomiting, and respiratory distress. She was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO) and pneumonia secondary to aspiration. The cause of SBO is unclear as she has no prior abdominal surgery. An NG tube was placed, and she is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition. 

Medical Complications:
1. Nausea/Vomiting/SBO: The etiology of the development of SBO in this patient without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. Close monitoring of WBC, potassium, creatinine, lactate, and abdominal exam is recommended.
2. Polycythemia: This is likely due to secondary causes such as COPD and hemoconcentration. It has been resolved with hydration, and further monitoring of hematocrit is advised.
3. Tachycardia: This is likely in the setting of respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring is necessary.
4. Hypoxia/Pneumonia: The patient likely aspirated based on CT findings. Close monitoring of respiratory status is required, and she should continue using home albuterol and ipratropium nebs. Antibiotics will be changed due to drug rash.
5. Drug Rash: Changing antibiotics today as mentioned above and continuing to monitor.
6. Bipolar Disorder: Holding outpatient psychiatric medications in the setting of SBO. IV haldol may be used judiciously"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with known COPD who presents with nausea, vomiting, and respiratory distress. The patient's symptoms are likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO) and pulmonary infarction in the setting of polycythemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Worsening of respiratory distress: The patient already has hypoxia and is unable to compensate due to underlying lung disease. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary, especially in the setting of acute illness and volume repletion.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to tolerate BiPAP and coughing up more phlegm suggests a higher risk of aspiration. Continued monitoring and management of aspiration pneumonia are crucial.

3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's labs show low potassium levels (K: 3.6 mEq/L) and slightly elevated lactate levels (1.1 mmol/L). Close monitoring of electrolytes and correction as needed is important.

4. Thromboembolic events: Despite the negative CT angiogram (CTA) for pulmonary embolism (PE), the patient's tachycardia and hypoxia still raise concerns for potential thromboembolic events. Continued monitoring is necessary.

5. Bipolar disorder management: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, and inpatient psychiatric medications need to be held during small bowel obstruction. IV hal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and now presents with significant evidence of basilar infiltrate concerning for aspiration pneumonia. She has been able to produce some sputum with cough, but has not had any further worsening of oxygenation or ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) - The patient's SBO has persisted despite conservative management, and there is concern for the need to maintain adequate nutrition as she is now 5 days into hospitalization. Continuing NPO status and monitoring the situation closely is recommended.
2. Hypoxemia and Respiratory Distress - The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia are likely due to aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) have been initiated, and the patient is being maintained on noninvasive ventilation. If the patient's condition worsens or if the rash continues or worsens, a change in antibiotics may be necessary.
3. Tachycardia - The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be due to various factors such as pain, anxiety, infection, or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation and management should be considered to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Potential Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) - The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin"

   may be resolving now.
   - continue NPO status
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   - surgery following; appreciate recs
   - [**Month (only) 60**] be able to pull BG tube if patient without nausea/emesis today.

   - appreciate Heme recs, will follow up as needed.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely in setting of respiratory distress.
   CTA without PE.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: patient likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Cough improving with much instruction.  Patient now with less tenuous
   respiratory status.

She presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), changes in antibiotics due to drug rash, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBO: The patient has been diagnosed with SBO, which can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, and infection if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Drug Rash: The patient has developed a drug rash likely due to the antibiotics vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Changing antibiotics may help resolve the rash, but it is important to monitor for any signs of allergic reactions or worsening skin condition.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels. Close monitoring and correction of these electrolytes are necessary to avoid complications like cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be secondary to respiratory distress and should be closely monitored. If it persists or worsens, further evaluation for other causes of tachyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a chief complaint of small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has been diagnosed with high-grade SBO and is experiencing mild abdominal pain, which has resolved with NSAID IV. She also has a rash likely from Zosyn, for which she was switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl. The patient is still experiencing mild hypoxia and has had small bowel movements. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to phenothiazines and an unknown allergy. Her last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole. She is currently receiving various medications including TPN, Pantoprazole (Protonix), Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.

Physical examination findings include tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, and warm skin with resolving rash. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/87 to 161/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool device and nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 8.3 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 12"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and likely aspiration pneumonia (PNA). She has been experiencing mild abdominal pain, which resolved with NSAID IV. The patient also has a rash, likely from Zosyn, and it is being treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl. She continues to have mild hypoxia and small bowel movements. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, with a heart rate of 113 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 134/87 mmHg to 161/89 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 85%. The patient has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, and her glucose levels are elevated. The patient has a history of phenothiazines allergy and unknown allergies. She has received multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has SBO, which can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, necrosis, perforation, and sepsis.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia (PNA): The patient likely has aspiration PNA, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a chief complaint of small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being NPO. The patient has experienced mild abdominal pain, which resolved with NSAID IV. She also developed a rash likely from Zosyn and was switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl. Mild hypoxia persists, and the patient continues to have small bowel movements.

The patient has a history of phenothiazine allergies and has received various antibiotics including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole. She is currently on Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, Pantoprazole (Protonix), and other medications as well.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/87 mmHg to 161/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

   71 yo female with SBO now with NGT removed and able to maintain
   oxygenation with NC alone.  She has had some meaninful return of bowel
   function as evidenced by passage of stool.  Of meaninful concern is
   elevation in WBC count which may be marker of infection.  Will have to
   check for C. Diff but otherwise do not have focal infection identified
   as source.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a chief complaint of small bowel obstruction (SBO). She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. The patient's arterial line stopped at 12:00 PM, and she has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/79 to 124/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's review of systems includes fatigue and cough. She is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results show a pH level of 7.35. Physical examination reveals that she is overweight/obese, has symmetric expansion and dullness in her chest, diminished breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and minimal stool and gas passage. Neurologic examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has not been assessed for movement or tone. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and lactic acid levels, while other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's imaging shows improved aeration in her lower lung fields. The assessment and plan include ongoing care for SBO,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 70 yo woman with known COPD presented with nausea, vomiting likely
   secondary to SBO, as well as pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration,
   clinically she appears stable to modestly improved, although still
   requiring large amounts of oxygen to maintain saturations.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: patient likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Her cough has been improving with much instruction, and her respiratory
   status is overall improved, although still somewhat tenuous on high
   amounts of supplemental oxygen. She was originally treated with
   Vanco/Zosyn for aspiration pna; however, she developed a drug rash on
   this regimen and was switched to Levo/Flagyl on [**5-3**].
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - chest PT and cough as needed
   - continue antibiotics with Levo/Flagyl for 8-day course
   - consider broadening coverage for MRSA if clinically worsens
   - will check CT chest today d/t fevers/white count/tenuous respiratory
   status and concern that current antibiotic regimen may not be
   sufficient; would like to check for interval change from previous CT
   mid last week
   - sputum cultures today
   - will start IV steroids today d/t wheezes heard on exam
   - check ABG this morning
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Unclear etiology at this time.  Patient also with
   fever to 101.5 overnight. Concern for UTI or possible aspiration event
   as patient started on sips.  C dif from [**5-4**] was negative.
   - follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - CT chest as above
   - consider broadening antimicrobial coverage if clinically worsens
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 53**] with no current
   n/v and minimal bowel sounds.   SBO may be resolving now.  NGT in
   place, tube feeds have been started.
   - advance TF rate as tolerated
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   - surgery following; appreciate recs
   - video study pending for Monday
   # Polycythemia: likely due to COPD and hemoconcentration.  Resolved
   with hydration.  Will continue to monitor hct, nothing more to do for
   now.
   - appreciate Heme recs, will follow up as needed.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely in setting of respiratory distress.
   CTA without PE.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Drug rash: resolved after antibiotic change as above
   # Bipolar Disorder: will need to hold outpt psychiatric meds in setting
   of SBO. Can use IV haldol judiciously if needed, however do not
   anticipate this will be necessary.
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # FEN:
   - Correct/replete electrolytes PRN
   - TF for now pending video evaluation as above
   - D%
 NS today due to thirst and possible dehydration

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note and agree
   with the findings and plan of care.  While overall Ms [**Known lastname 8842**] has
   improved, today she is showing more hypoxemia which is not due to
   further increase in PC02.  Her CXR is not significantly changed to my
   eye compared to yesterday
s.  She was changed to Levo/Flagyl yesterday
   from Zosyn/Vanco due to rash.  She also developed a fever last night.
   The etiology of her worse V/Q mismatch is not entirely clear. I doubt
   CHF or PE.  It could be the wheezing we hear prominently on exam today
   or mucus plugging as her sputum by report is thick and yellow.  We have
   started IV steroids and will try Mucomyst by nebs, in addition to high
   fi02 and Xopenex and Ipatropium nebs.  We will also consult with ID
   about changing antibiotic coverage pending sputum culture results.
   However, she is very close to needing intubation if these measures

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD who presented with nausea, vomiting likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration. 

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- General: awake, alert, and oriented; in mild respiratory distress, although maintaining O2 sats as above
- Lungs: coarse breath sounds anteriorly; scattered wheezes in posterior fields
- Heart: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2
- Abdomen: soft and non-tender; HYPOACTIVE bowel sounds present; abdominal rash has resolved
- Extremities: non-edematous, no rashes

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tmax: 38.6 C (101.5 F)
- Tcurrent: 36.2 C (97.1 F)
- HR: 109 bpm (97 - 109 bpm)
- BP: 113/87 mmHg (93/61 - 122/87 mmHg)

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Hypoxia/pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is still somewhat tenuous on high amounts of supplemental oxygen, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. This may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, possibly unrelated to the initial aspiration pneumonia. This could indicate a secondary infection or a worsening of the current infection.
3. Nausea/vomiting/SBO: The patient's SBO may resolve, but there"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 70 yo woman with known COPD presents with neasea, vomiting likely
   secondary to SBO, as well as pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration.
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  NGT pulled.  Patient with
   no current n/v and minimal bowel sounds.   SBO may be resolving now.
   - advance diet as tolerated.
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   - surgery following; appreciate recs
   - Speech and swallow eval.
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear at this time.  Patient also with low grade temp
   overnight (100.4). Concern for UTI or possible aspiration event as
   patient started on sips.
   -Bl Cx
   -Urine Cx
   -CXR.
   # Polycythemia: likely mix of secondary to COPD and hemoconcentration.
   Resolved with hydration.  Will continue to monitor hct, nothing more to
   do for now.
   - appreciate Heme recs, will follow up as needed.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely in setting of respiratory distress.
   CTA without PE.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: patient likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Cough improving with much instruction.  Patient now with less tenuous
   respiratory status.
   - will need to monitor respiratory status closely in the setting of
   acute illness and volume repletion. Continue home albuterol and
   ipratropium nebs.
   -chest PT and cough as needed
   -will change antibiotics from vanco/Zosyn to Levo/Flagyl due to drug
   rash on abdomen and back (continue for 8-day course for aspiration
   pneumonia coverage)
   # Drug rash: changing antibiotics today as above; continue to monitor
   # Bipolar Disorder: will need to hold outpt psychiatric meds in setting
   of SBO. Can use IV haldol judiciously if needed, however do not
   anticipate this will be necessary.
   # GERD: Continue PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 70-year-old woman with known COPD, was admitted with nausea, vomiting, suspected small bowel obstruction (SBO), and pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration. The patient's respiratory status has improved but still requires a significant amount of oxygen to maintain saturation levels. She was initially treated with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for aspiration pneumonia, but developed a drug rash and was switched to Levofloxacin and Metronidazole on [5-3]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Pneumonia: The patient's ongoing requirement for high amounts of supplemental oxygen indicates ongoing respiratory distress, which could lead to further hypoxia and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an ongoing infection. It is unclear at this time if this is due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), aspiration event, or another source. Monitoring and further investigation are necessary to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate treatment.
3. Nausea/Vomiting/SBO: The etiology of the patient's SBO without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. The presence of minimal bowel sounds and resolution of symptoms suggest that the SBO may be resolving. However, close monitoring of laboratory parameters and abdominal examination is warranted to ensure continued improvement.
4. Polycythemia: The patient's elevated hematocrit is"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD presented originally with nausea,
   vomiting likely secondary to SBO, as well as pneumonia likely secondary
   to aspiration, treated initially with vanc/Zosyn, then levo/Flagyl
   after development of drug rash. Unfortunately, on the latter regimen,
   her respiratory status worsened, she developed white count and spiked
   fevers, requiring alteration of antibiotics and intubation for hypoxic
   respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: patient likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Her cough had been improving with much instruction, and her respiratory
   status had improved originally with vanco/Zosyn for aspiration pna;
   however, she developed a drug rash on this regimen and was switched to
   levo/Flagyl on [**5-3**]. With the levo/Flagyl, she spiked and developed
   increasing oxygen demands necessitating intubation on [**5-5**]. She is
   currently on assist control ventilation, with vanco/aztreonam/flagyl
   for aspiration pna coverage. She is afebrile with decreasing white
   count since starting this regimen.
   -continue albuterol and ipratropium inh
   -taper methylprednisolone to 40 mg q8h
   -continue antibiotics with vanco/aztreonam/Flagyl- course not yet
   decided on
   -bronchoscopy today
   -f/u sputum culture
   -repeat ABG this morning
   # Leukocytosis/fever: improving after antibiotic adjustment as above
   -follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   # Hypotension/increase in lactate: hypotension believed due to
   combination of PEEP and sedation on vent since before intubation she
   was never hypotensive, despite ongoing infection. The low BP has
   responded well to IVF. However, due to rising lactate, we would like to
   maintain slightly higher MAPs. Therefore, will aim for MAPs >65 with
   fluid boluses prn.
   -fluid bolus 500 cc prn
   -repeat lactic acid in afternoon with ABG
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 53**] with no current
   n/v and minimal bowel sounds.  SBO may be resolving now.  NGT in place,
   tube feeds have been started.
   - advance TF rate as tolerated
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   - surgery following; appreciate recs
   # Polycythemia: likely due to COPD and hemoconcentration.  Resolved
   with hydration.  Will continue to monitor hct, nothing more to do for
   now.
   - appreciate Heme recs, will follow up as needed.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely in setting of respiratory distress.
   CTA without PE.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Drug rash: resolved after antibiotic change as above
   # Bipolar Disorder: will need to hold outpt psychiatric meds in setting
   of SBO. Can use IV haldol judiciously if needed, however do not
   anticipate this will be necessary.

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD who presented with nausea, vomiting likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration. She was initially treated with vancomycin/Zosyn, then switched to levofloxacin/Flagyl due to a drug rash. Unfortunately, her respiratory status worsened, and she developed white count and fever spikes, requiring alteration of antibiotics and intubation for hypoxic respiratory distress.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Hypoxia/pneumonia: The patient likely aspirated based on CT findings. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient developed white count and fever spikes, indicating an ongoing infection. If not properly managed, it may progress to sepsis or septic shock.

3. Hypotension/increase in lactate: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to the combination of PEEP and sedation on the ventilator. This can result in decreased tissue perfusion and an increase in lactate levels, indicating possible tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.

4. Nausea/vomiting/SBO: The etiology of the development of SBO in this patient without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. If not managed appropriately, it"

   On this day I examined this patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8911**]
 note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.   24 hour events on Ms [**Known lastname 8842**]
   include intubation and mech ventilation for tachypnea and  hypoxemia
   and hypercarbia.  Today she
s doing some better with ABG: 7.28/68/85 in
   this woman who likely lives with Pco2 of 60. Current vent settings: VT
   320cc on A/C with Fio2 50% and 10 PEEP.
   She has lots of purulent thick secretions and not only will we await
   culture results but will plan on bronchoscopy to facilitate airway
   clearance and hopefully V/Q matching. A line will be inserted and
   lactate will be followed.  However her wheezing is improved and WBC
   normal, and for now the plan is to stay with current antibiotics.  40
   min spent in thd care of this critically ill patient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD who presented with nausea, vomiting likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration. The patient's respiratory status worsened after being switched to a different antibiotic regimen, leading to hypoxic respiratory distress and subsequent intubation.

The patient is currently on assist-control ventilation with vancomycin/aztreonam/Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia coverage. Her white blood cell count has decreased since starting this regimen. The plan is to continue the antibiotics, perform a bronchoscopy, and repeat an arterial blood gas (ABG) this morning.

The patient also has hypotension and an increase in lactate levels, believed to be due to a combination of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and sedation on the ventilator. The low blood pressure has responded well to intravenous fluids (IVF). However, due to rising lactate levels, the goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 with fluid boluses as needed.

Regarding the nausea and vomiting, the etiology of the SBO in this patient without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. The patient's bowel sounds are hypoactive, and tube feeds have been started. The plan is to advance the tube feeding rate as tolerated.

The patient also has polycythemia, likely due to COPD and hemoconcentration, which has resolved with hydration"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD presented originally with nausea,
   vomiting likely secondary to SBO, as well as pneumonia likely secondary
   to aspiration, treated initially with vanc/Zosyn, then levo/Flagyl
   after development of drug rash. Unfortunately, on the latter regimen,
   her respiratory status worsened, she developed white count and spiked,
   requiring alteration of antibiotics and intubation for hypoxic
   respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: patient likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Her cough had been improving with much instruction, and her respiratory
   status had improved originally with vanco/Zosyn for aspiration pna;
   however, she developed a drug rash on this regimen and was switched to
   levo/Flagyl on [**5-3**]. With the levo/Flagyl, she spiked and developed
   increasing oxygen demands necessitating intubation on [**5-5**]. She is
   currently on AC, with vanco/aztreonam/flagyl for aspiration pna
   coverage. She is afebrile with decreasing white count since starting
   this regimen.
   -continue albuterol and ipratropium inh
   -continue methylprednisolone
   -continue antibiotics with vanco/aztreonam/Flagyl for 14-day course
   (currently day 8)
   -consider CT chest to evaluate progression of pneumonia
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -repeat ABG this morning
   # Leukocytosis/fever: improving after antibiotic adjustment as above
   - follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - CT chest as above
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 53**] with no current
   n/v and minimal bowel sounds.  SBO may be resolving now.  NGT in place,
   tube feeds have been started.
   - advance TF rate as tolerated
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   - surgery following; appreciate recs
   # Polycythemia: likely due to COPD and hemoconcentration.  Resolved
   with hydration.  Will continue to monitor hct, nothing more to do for

   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely in setting of respiratory distress.
   CTA without PE.  Will continue to monitor.

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD who presented with nausea, vomiting likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration. She was initially treated with vancomycin (Vanco) and Zosyn, then switched to levofloxacin (Levo) and metronidazole (Flagyl) after developing a drug rash. Unfortunately, her respiratory status worsened, she developed leukocytosis, and she required intubation for hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia/pneumonia, leukocytosis/fever, nausea/vomiting/SBO, polycythemia, tachycardia, drug rash, bipolar disorder, GERD, and electrolyte imbalance. She is currently on antibiotics with vancomycin, aztreonam, and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia coverage. She is also on albuterol and ipratropium inhalers, methylprednisolone, and tube feeds have been started.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, worsening leukocytosis/fever, worsening nausea/vomiting/SBO, further electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD presented originally with nausea,
   vomiting likely secondary to SBO, as well as pneumonia likely secondary
   to aspiration, treated initially with vanc/Zosyn, then levo/Flagyl
   after development of drug rash. Unfortunately, on the latter regimen,
   her respiratory status worsened, she developed white count and spiked
   fevers, requiring alteration of antibiotics and intubation for hypoxic
   respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: patient likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Her cough had been improving with much instruction, and her respiratory
   status had improved originally with vanco/Zosyn for aspiration pna;
   however, she developed a drug rash on this regimen and was switched to
   levo/Flagyl on [**5-3**]. With the levo/Flagyl, she spiked and developed
   increasing oxygen demands necessitating intubation on [**5-5**]. She is
   currently on assist control ventilation, with vanco/aztreonam/flagyl
   for aspiration pna coverage. She is afebrile with decreasing white
   count since starting this regimen.
   -continue albuterol and ipratropium inh
   -taper methylprednisolone to 40 mg q8h
   -continue antibiotics with vanco/aztreonam/Flagyl- course not yet
   decided on
   -bronchoscopy today
   -f/u sputum culture
   -repeat ABG this morning
   # Leukocytosis/fever: improving after antibiotic adjustment as above
   -follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   # Hypotension/increase in lactate: hypotension believed due to
   combination of PEEP and sedation on vent since before intubation she
   was never hypotensive, despite ongoing infection. The low BP has
   responded well to IVF. However, due to rising lactate, we would like to
   maintain slightly higher MAPs. Therefore, will aim for MAPs >65 with
   fluid boluses prn.
   -fluid bolus 500 cc prn
   -repeat lactic acid in afternoon with ABG
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 53**] with no current
   n/v and minimal bowel sounds.  SBO may be resolving now.  NGT in place,
   tube feeds have been started.
   - advance TF rate as tolerated
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   - surgery following; appreciate recs
   # Polycythemia: likely due to COPD and hemoconcentration.  Resolved
   with hydration.  Will continue to monitor hct, nothing more to do for
   now.
   - appreciate Heme recs, will follow up as needed.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely in setting of respiratory distress.
   CTA without PE.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Drug rash: resolved after antibiotic change as above
   # Bipolar Disorder: will need to hold outpt psychiatric meds in setting
   of SBO. Can use IV haldol judiciously if needed, however do not
   anticipate this will be necessary.
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # FEN:
   - Correct/replete electrolytes PRN
   - TF for now pending video evaluation as above
   - D5
 NS today due to thirst and possible dehydration

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of COPD.
- She presented with nausea, vomiting likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration.
- She was initially treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, then switched to metronidazole and Flagyl due to a drug rash.
- Unfortunately, her respiratory status worsened, she developed white count and spiked fevers, requiring alteration of antibiotics and intubation for hypoxic respiratory distress.
- She is currently on assist-control ventilation, with vancomycin, aztreonam, and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia coverage.
- She is afebrile with decreasing white count since starting this regimen.
- She has hypoxia/pneumonia, leukocytosis/fever, hypotension/increase in lactate, nausea/vomiting/SBO, polycythemia, tachycardia, drug rash, bipolar disorder, GERD, and potential electrolyte imbalance.
- She is being closely monitored with various interventions and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's worsening respiratory status and development of white count and fevers indicate a possible complication of aspiration pneumonia. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potentially require more aggressive interventions such as bronchoscopy or tracheostomy.
2. Sepsis: The combination of fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggests the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and lactate levels is essential to detect and manage this condition promptly.
3. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient's initial presentation included symptoms consistent with SBO. Although her condition has improved, ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess the resolution of SBO and prevent further complications like bowel ischemia or perforation.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of vomiting, diarrhea, and ongoing fluid resuscitation puts her at risk for electrolyte imbalances. Frequent electrolyte measurements and appropriate corrections are required to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility due to intubation and bed rest increases the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and repositioning are crucial to prevent and manage these complications.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Surveillance cultures, bronchoscopy, and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be important in preventing and treating this complication.

These are potential medical complications based on the information provided. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage these risks and optimize the patient's recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with mental retardation and now with SBO and likely
   significant aspiration leading to bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and
   now progression to hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  This
   is likely evidence of intermittent mucus plugging but with fevers
   concern for worsening or new infection is significant.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Will be supported as follows, for
   1a)Aspiration Pneumonia-Vanco/Aztreonam/Flagyl
follow up sputum
   cultures
   1b)Mucus plugging/Lobar Collapse
Will pursue bronchoscopy for evidence
   of lobar collapse certainly but will need to evaluate for possible
   organism with quantitative BAL specimen
   1c)Will work to wean ventilator today and decrease PEEP to 5
   -Will need continued wean of ventilator and work to allo optimal chance
   at success with extubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD presenting with SBO and hypoxia thought
   secondary to COPD and overlying pneumonia likely secondary to
   aspiration, improving initially on abx but worsened requiring
   intubation when regimen revised for drug rash; now improved on current
   abx and s/p bronch suctioning.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: Likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Respiratory status had improved originally with vanco/Zosyn but she was
   switched to levo/flagyl on [**5-3**] for drug rash. She subsequently spiked
   and developed increasing oxygen demands necessitating intubation on [**5-5**]
   and revision of abx to vanc/aztreonam/flagyl. Improved on vent s/p
   suctioning and on current abx.
   -Change methylpred to prednisone 60mg, continue albuterol and
   ipratropium inh
   -Continue vanco/aztreonam/Flagyl with plan for 8-day course, D1

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia. The hypoxia was thought to be secondary to COPD and an underlying pneumonia likely due to aspiration. Initially, the patient showed improvement on antibiotics but then worsened and required intubation when the antibiotic regimen was revised for a drug rash. Currently, the patient is improving on the current antibiotics and has undergone bronchial suctioning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/pneumonia: The patient may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as worsening pneumonia or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and chest X-rays is necessary.
2. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which can indicate an ongoing infection. Regular monitoring of temperature and white blood cell count is needed. Cultures should be obtained to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during intubation, which responded to fluids. Monitoring of blood pressure is essential to detect any recurrence of hypotension, especially during extubation.
4. Nausea/vomiting/SBO: The etiology of the patient's small bowel obstruction is unclear, but it appears to be resolved at present. Close monitoring of abdominal"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD presented originally with nausea,
   vomiting likely secondary to SBO, as well as pneumonia likely secondary
   to aspiration, treated initially with vanc/Zosyn, then levo/Flagyl
   after development of drug rash. Unfortunately, on the latter regimen,
   her respiratory status worsened, she developed white count and spiked
   fevers, requiring alteration of antibiotics and intubation for hypoxic
   respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: patient likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Her cough had been improving with much instruction, and her respiratory
   status had improved originally with vanco/Zosyn for aspiration pna;
   however, she developed a drug rash on this regimen and was switched to
   levo/Flagyl on [**5-3**]. With the levo/Flagyl, she spiked and developed
   increasing oxygen demands necessitating intubation on [**5-5**]. She is
   currently on assist control ventilation, with vanco/aztreonam/flagyl
   for aspiration pna coverage. She is afebrile with decreasing white
   count since starting this regimen.
   -continue albuterol and ipratropium inh
   -taper methylprednisolone to 40 mg q8h
   -continue antibiotics with vanco/aztreonam/Flagyl- course not yet
   decided on
   -bronchoscopy today, was not done yesterday.
   -f/u sputum culture
   -repeat ABG this morning
   # Leukocytosis/fever: improving after antibiotic adjustment as above.
   No culture data to date.  Plan on Bronch today with BAL for organism.
   -follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   # Hypotension: occurred in the setting of intubation, sedation and
   increased PEEP.  She responded to fluids and her hypotension has
   resolved.
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  Currently resolved.  NGT
   in place, tube feeds have been started.  Tube feeds at goal.
   - close monitoring of WBC, K, Cr, lactate; trend abdominal exam as
   well, though this may be less helpful given pt's MR
   - surgery following; appreciate recs
   # Polycythemia: likely due to COPD and hemoconcentration.  Resolved
   with hydration.  Will continue to monitor hct, nothing more to do for

   - appreciate Heme recs, will follow up as needed.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely in setting of respiratory distress.
   CTA without PE.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Drug rash: resolved after antibiotic change as above
   # Bipolar Disorder: will need to hold outpt psychiatric meds in setting
   of SBO. Can use IV haldol judiciously if needed, however do not
   anticipate this will be necessary.
   # GERD: Continue PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD who presented with nausea, vomiting likely secondary to small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration.
- She was initially treated with vancomycin and aztreonam, then switched to levofloxacin and metronidazole after developing a drug rash.
- Unfortunately, her respiratory status worsened, she developed a high white blood cell count and fever, requiring a change in antibiotics and intubation for hypoxic respiratory distress.
- She has been on assist-control ventilation and is currently receiving vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole for aspiration pneumonia coverage.
- Her fever has resolved, and her white blood cell count is decreasing since starting this regimen.
- She is also being treated for hypoxia, leukocytosis/fever, hypotension, nausea/vomiting/SBO, polycythemia, tachycardia, drug rash, bipolar disorder, GERD, and FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional management).
- The patient's condition is currently stable, and she is expected to continue receiving ICU care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and re-intubation. The patient had evidence of significant left-sided opacities, which were cleared through bronchoscopy. The patient's respiratory failure improved with management of airways obstruction, pneumonia, and airway-related mucus plugging and collapse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure - The patient continues to have mild residual wheezes but is tolerating minimal respiratory support. Treatment includes pneumonia antibiotics, continued steroid treatment for COPD, aggressive chest physical therapy, coughing, and suctioning.
2) Pneumonia - The patient is being treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.
3) Mucus Plugging - The patient will require aggressive chest physical therapy, coughing, and suctioning to prevent further mucus plugging.
4) Extubation - The plan is to hold the tracheostomy tube and move towards extubation this morning.
5) Pain Control - The patient's acute and chronic pain will be managed appropriately.
6) Small Bowel Obstruction - The patient has a history of small bowel obstruction, which may require further intervention.
7) Tachycardia - The patient has other causes of tachycardia, which need to be addressed.
8) ICU Care - The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD presenting with SBO and hypoxia thought
   secondary to COPD and overlying pneumonia likely secondary to
   aspiration, improving initially on abx but worsened requiring
   intubation when regimen revised for drug rash; now improved on current
   abx and s/p bronch suctioning.
   # Hypoxia/pneumonia: Likely aspirated based on CT findings.
   Respiratory status had improved originally with vanco/Zosyn but she was
   switched to levo/flagyl on [**5-3**] for drug rash. She subsequently spiked
   and developed increasing oxygen demands necessitating intubation on [**5-5**]
   and revision of abx to vanc/aztreonam/flagyl. Improved on vent s/p
   suctioning and bronch and on current abx.
   -Change methylpred to prednisone 60mg, continue albuterol and
   ipratropium inh
   -Continue vanco/aztreonam/Flagyl with plan for 8-day course, D1
   beginning when afebrile on [**5-6**]
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Improving after antibiotic adjustment as above.
   No culture data to date.
   -F/u pending sputum cultures
   # Hypotension: occurred in the setting of intubation, sedation and
   increased PEEP.  She responded to fluids and her hypotension has

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of COPD who presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia. The hypoxia was initially thought to be secondary to COPD and an underlying pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. The patient initially improved on antibiotics but then worsened and required intubation when the antibiotic regimen was revised due to a drug rash. The patient has now improved on the current antibiotics and underwent bronchial suctioning.

The patient's respiratory status had initially improved with vancomycin and Zosyn but was switched to levofoxacin and Flagyl on [**5-3**] for the drug rash. Subsequently, the patient spiked and developed increasing oxygen demands, necessitating intubation on [**5-5**] and revision of antibiotics to vancomycin, aztreonam, and Flagyl. The patient has improved on ventilation following suctioning and bronchoscopy and on the current antibiotics.

The patient's leukocytosis and fever are improving after adjusting the antibiotics. No culture data are available yet, and follow-up pending sputum cultures is planned. The patient experienced hypotension during intubation, sedation, and increased PEEP but responded to fluids and has resolved. 

The patient also had nausea, vomiting, and SBO, but the etiology of the SBO is unclear. It has since resolved, and the patient has started receiving tube"

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She was initially admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and experienced significant aspiration events, leading to bilateral pneumonia and collapse. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated without any events. 

Key findings from the review of systems include:
- Respiratory: The patient has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure has been stable within normal limits.
- Neurologic: The patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Movement, tone, and skin assessments are not documented.

From the physical examination, the following observations were made:
- General appearance: The patient is described as overweight/obese.
- Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 heart sounds are present, but distant.
- Peripheral vascular: Radial and digital pulses are not assessed.
- Respiratory/chest: Expansion is symmetric, percussion reveals dullness, and diminished breath sounds are noted.
- Abdominal: The abdomen is soft and non-tender.
- Extremities: Edema is present in both lower extremities.
- Neurologic: The patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Movement, tone, and skin assessments are not documented.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 9.1-12.1 K/uL
- Platelet count: 191-280 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 110 mg/dL
- Sodium: 140 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
- Chloride: 98 mEq/L
- Carbon dioxide: 32-35 mmHg
- BUN: 19 mg/dL
- Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
- Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L

Radiology results are not provided in the given note.

Assessment and plan:
The patient has done well with extubation, with significant secretions cleared during bronchoscopy. She is expected to continue with respiratory support and receive ongoing care in the ICU. The plan includes continuing with Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl for pneumonia, as well as albendazole and atropine for wheezing. The patient is encouraged to move to a chair, undergo chest physiotherapy, and be suctioned as needed. Ambulation is also encouraged. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include pneumonia, aspiration, pain control, and small bowel obstruction."
