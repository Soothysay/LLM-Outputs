   PNA requiring long intubation and trach placement. He had been doing
   well at home s/p trach removal. Now presenting with acute onset of
   respiratory distress. No witnessed aspiration event. CXR with
   multifocal opacities concerning for edema vs infiltrate.
   - Continue invasive ventilation - versed and fentanyl for sedation

   culture. Pt chronically immunosuppressed given kidney transplant, has
   been on PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 4384**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), chronic aspiration, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who underwent a cadaveric renal transplant in [**2175**]. He was recently admitted to the MICU for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and was doing well at home after the removal of his tracheostomy. However, he presented with acute respiratory distress and is now in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Vital signs:
   - Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
   - Heart rate: 57 bpm (normal range: 49-69 bpm)
   - Blood pressure: 101/32 mmHg (normal range: 49-135/25-68 mmHg)
   - Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (normal range: 10-18 breaths per minute)
   - Oxygen saturation: 99% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on invasive ventilation with fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. His heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 633 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 1,998 mL of urine. There is a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, chronic kidney disease post-cadaveric renal transplant, hypertension, coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and type 1 diabetes. The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress, which is suspected to be caused by either congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia (PNA). 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/32 to 135/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with pinpoint pupils, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), crackles in the left lung, and a history of chronic aspiration. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, mildly elevated blood glucose, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a low potassium level. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), antibiotics (levofloxacin and ceftriaxone), sedatives (fentanyl and midazolam), and other medications for his comorbidities such as diabetes,"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, chronic kidney disease post-cadaveric renal transplant, cerebrovascular accident, chronic aspiration, and coronary artery disease status post-coronary artery bypass grafting. He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for aspiration pneumonia and later developed congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, leading to respiratory failure and intubation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/43 mmHg to 140/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is extubated and follows commands but remains very sleepy. Physical examination findings include pinpoint pupils, an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) of approximately 12 cm, left-sided crackles in the lungs, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and trace lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values such as blood glucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal a small pericardial effusion but no signs of tamponade, and the echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular"

The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress and was found to have hypoxic respiratory failure, which was likely due to pneumonia (PNA) or congestive heart failure (CHF).
