","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension, systolic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and leg edema, and subsequently developed chest pain with ST-T wave changes on electrocardiogram (ECG). This prompted a cardiac catheterization that revealed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was transferred to another hospital for further management.

On admission, the patient was started on nitroglycerin for chest pain control, beta-blockers for blood pressure control, and aspirin for antiplatelet therapy. He was also placed on a low-sodium diet and instructed to restrict fluid intake. The patient's vital signs were stable with a heart rate in the low 100s, blood pressure around 130/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 95%.

A bedside echocardiogram showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%. The right ventricular cavity was dilated with borderline normal function. There was trace aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient's blood glucose levels were elevated at 216 mg/dL, but his troponin-T levels were within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results showed a slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension, systolic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. He then developed chest pain with ST-T wave changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG), prompting cardiac catheterization that revealed severe three-vessel disease. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further management.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced chest pain at 21:11 that improved with nitroglycerin.
- He was given a total of 15 mg IV lopressor for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- A bedside echocardiogram showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%. There was relative sparing of the inferior wall with hypokinesis of the remaining myocardial segments. The right ventricular cavity was dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve was not well seen, but there was no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation and mild (1+) mitral regurgitation were observed. There was no pericardial effusion.
- The patient will undergo an echocardiogram and carotid duplex in the morning.
- He received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit (Hct) level of 28.
- No additional episodes of chest pain occurred overnight.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Multivessel CAD: The patient is evaluated by Cardiology overnight. The plan is to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the morning.
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and carotid duplex in the morning
   - Chest X-ray (CXR) in the morning
   - Continue nitroglycerin for pain control
   - Keep systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 100 to maintain coronary perfusion
   - Continue aspirin (ASA) and beta-blocker (BB) therapy
   - NPO (nothing by mouth) for procedure
   - Follow-up with preoperative Cardiology recommendations

2. Pump: The bedside echocardiogram last night showed an EF of 30-35% with trace aortic regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation. The patient remains euvolemic on examination.
   - Hold lasix this morning given the patient is going to surgery
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg three times daily (TID)
   - Continue lisinopril 10 mg daily

3. Rhythm: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation with a controlled heart rate in the 80s.
   - Give 5 mg IV lopressor bolus to get HR < 100

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for chest pain and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient experienced an episode of chest pain at 2111, which improved with nitroglycerin. He was given a total of 15 mg IV lopressor for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The bedside echo showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30-35%. There was relative sparing of the inferior wall with hypokinesis of the remaining myocardial segments. The right ventricular cavity was dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve was not well seen, but there was no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation was observed. The mitral valve leaflets were moderately thickened, and mild (1+) mitral regurgitation was seen, although the severity of mitral regurgitation may be underestimated due to acoustic shadowing. There was no pericardial effusion. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hematocrit level of 28. The patient did not have any additional episodes of chest pain overnight.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient received lopressor for this condition.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, systolic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and lower extremity edema, followed by chest pain and ST-T wave changes on electrocardiogram (ECG). A cardiac catheterization revealed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred to this hospital for further management.

The patient's current condition includes multivessel CAD, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), systolic heart failure, COPD, and a recent drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently receiving nitroglycerin for chest pain control, beta-blockers for blood pressure control and rate control in AFib, and diuretics for fluid management.

The plan is to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the morning. Preoperative assessments include a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and carotid duplex, as well as a chest X-ray. In the meantime, the patient's medications will be continued, including aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins. He will be kept nil per os (NPO) for the procedure.

The aortic valve is not well seen, but there is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen, and the mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is present, with the severity potentially underestimated due to acoustic shadowing. There is no pericardial effusion.

The patient's current medications include nitroglycerin, metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and lisinopril. He is also on supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%. The plan is to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension, systolic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and lower extremity edema, which were followed by chest pain and ST-T wave changes on the ECG. Subsequently, he underwent cardiac catheterization that revealed severe three-vessel disease. He was transferred to another hospital for further management.

The patient has been diagnosed with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Prior to the surgery, a bedside echocardiogram showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, trace aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing consistent with COPD and 1+ lower extremity pitting edema.

Laboratory findings include a white blood cell count of 9.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration of 28.3 g/dL, platelet count of 243 x 10"
