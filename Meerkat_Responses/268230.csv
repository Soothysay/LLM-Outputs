","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that has transitioned to leukemia. He presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The labs and CT scan indicate evidence of pancreatitis.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Pancreatitis: The most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis due to the acute onset. Since the stone is not visible on current imaging, it may have passed. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with good urine output, and his pain has improved. Pain control is being managed with IV dilaudid in small doses. IV fluids are being titrated to blood pressure and urine output, considering his history of congestive heart failure (CHF). Central access is being held due to neutropenia and hemodynamic stability. Antibiotics (cefepime and flagyl) are being continued for biliary coverage prior to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Additionally, one dose of [Last Name (LF)] and [First Name3 (LF)] is being held until renal function stabilizes. Blood and urine cultures are to be followed up, along with trends in lipase, amylase, etc. Aggressive electrolyte repletion is also planned. ERCP is planned in the morning to evaluate any residual stone.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF):"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, likely due to gallstones. This condition requires supportive care and monitoring.

2. Biliary obstruction: There is a concern for gallstone-related biliary obstruction, which could lead to cholecystitis or cholangitis. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been scheduled to address this issue.

3. Fever: The patient's fever is attributed to cholecystitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been prescribed in the setting of neutropenia.

4. Fluids: The patient's fluid status requires close monitoring and management. Volume resuscitation is planned to address acute renal failure.

5. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all blood cell types. This may be due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemic transformation. Monitoring of blood counts is necessary, and transfusions may be required.

6. Chronic heart failure (CHF): The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%. Monitoring for evidence of CHF exacerbation is essential.

7. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving with volume resuscitation. Continued fluid management and monitoring of urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of acute pancreatitis, possibly caused by gallstones. The patient's condition has improved, and they are receiving supportive care. There is concern for biliary obstruction and the possibility of cholecystitis or cholangitis. An ERCP procedure is planned for further evaluation. The patient also has fever, which may be attributed to cholecystitis, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to neutropenia.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%. They are also experiencing acute renal failure, which is improving with volume resuscitation. Fluids will continue to be administered, and renal function will be monitored. The patient's respiratory status is stable with good oxygenation on minimal supplemental oxygen.

The patient has anemia, but it is not at a transfusion threshold. No evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was found. The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is well-controlled. Nutritional support is not currently being provided, as the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving with volume resuscitation, but close monitoring of urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels is necessary to assess the progress.

2. Biliary obstruction: There is concern for gallstone-related biliary obstruction"

   .
   #. Pancreatitis: Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis given
   the acute onset. Stone not visible on current imaging so may have
   passed. Currently HD stable with good UOP. Pain improved.
   -Pain control with IV dilaudid in small doses
   -IVF titrate to BP and UOP, carefully given hx of CHF
   -Hold on central access for now given neutropenia and HD stability.
   -Con't cefepime/flagyl for biliary coverage prior to ERCP, also got one
   dose of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] hold on further until renal function stabilized.
   -F/U bld/urine cx
   -Trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase etc.
   -Aggressive electrolyte repletion
   -ERCP planned for am to evaluate if any residual stone
   -Vit. K for INR of 1.5, goal platelets >50, transfuse as necessary
   .
   #.ARF: Likely prerenal. Has now received ample IVF
   -Recheck in am, con't IVF as above.
   -Hold ramipril for now

   #. MDS/AML: Persistently neutropenic s/p 2 cycles of Dacogen. Due to
   start 3rd cycle today. However, becoming less transfusion dependent
   given stable to improved HCT and platelets. However, may be
   hemoconcentrated.
   -Con't renally dose allopurinol
   -Discuss with primary onc ([**Doctor Last Name 363**]) in am re: Dacogen and utility of
   GCSF

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transitioning to leukemia. He presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with evidence of pancreatitis on labs and CT imaging. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.6Â°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/46 mmHg to 132/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination findings include atrial fibrillation and peripheral vascular issues. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests, among others. The patient's assessment and plan include managing pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, hyperglycemia, MDS/acute myeloid leukemia, and congestive heart failure. He is currently in the ICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest pancreatitis. Complications of pancreatitis can include systemic inflammation, necrosis of the pancreatic tissue, pseudocysts, and sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.

   # Hyperglycemia: Resolved
   -RISS for now
   .
   #. MDS/AML: Literature supports GMCSF for neutrapenic fever in MDS if
   infection/fever not responding to Abx or with EPO to increase RBC
   production.
   - Hold on GMCSF for now as fever likely [**2-25**] pancreatitis
   .
   #Delerium: Several etiologies including pain, sleep deprivation,
   opiates, constipation. Most likely would be pain and sleep deprivation
   so will be more aggressive with pain control and maximize sleep
   hygeine. Will only use antipsychotics PRN if pt. very combative as they
   increase risk falls, aspiration, stroke, torsades.
   - Aggressive pain management
   - Improve sleep hygeine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who has transitioned to leukemia. He presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and evidence of pancreatitis on labs and CT scan. The patient's current conditions include pancreatitis, acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, delirium, congestive heart failure (CHF), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are as follows:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has signs of gallstone pancreatitis. Complications such as abscess formation, pseudocyst, necrosis, or secondary infection may occur if not managed properly.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is likely experiencing prerenal ARF, which may worsen without aggressive volume repletion. Complications may include sepsis, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.

3. Hyperglycemia: Although the patient's hyperglycemia has resolved, it can recur if not closely monitored. Complications of uncontrolled hyperglycemia include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, and increased risk of infections.

4. Delirium: The patient is delirious, which can have multiple etiologies including pain, sleep deprivation, opiates,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with acute pancreatitis attributed to gallstones. The patient has undergone an ERCP procedure with stenting, and there is a concern for biliary obstruction leading to cholecystitis and cholangitis. The patient is oxygenating well on supplemental oxygen but has infiltrates on a chest X-ray, which may be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or low lung volumes.

The patient is experiencing fever, which is attributed to cholecystitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued in the setting of neutropenia. The patient's pain regimen includes IV dilaudid with good control, but they are not yet taking oral medication. Delirium is suspected to be predominantly due to medications, especially pain medications, and possibly toxic-metabolic or ICU psychosis. There is doubt regarding CNS infection.

Fluid management is planned to continue volume resuscitation and monitor for CHF. Pancytopenia is present, possibly due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with leukemic transformation, and neutropenia is being monitored. GM-CSF is not indicated. Chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35% is also noted, and evidence of CHF is being monitored.

The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which has improved with volume resuscitation. Fluids are being continued, and urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN),"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis attributed to gallstones. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure with stenting yesterday and is experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which responded to IV metoprolol.

The patient is also exhibiting confusion and has self-disconnected IV lines. They are receiving a PRBC transfusion and have been administered antibiotics (Vancomycin, Metronidazole, and Cefepime) for an unknown duration.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 113 bpm and low blood pressure ranging from 77/42 mmHg to 125/63 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on a nasal cannula, and their ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, no signs of overweight or obesity, no conjunctival pallor, and no peripheral edema. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and no murmurs. The respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with no crackles or wheezes. The abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender bowel sounds with tenderness in the epigastric and right upper quadrant (RUQ). There are no signs of muscle wasting or clubbing in the extremities.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transitioning to leukemia. He presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient also showed evidence of pancreatitis on lab tests and CT scan.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's amylase/lipase levels are improving, indicating a positive response to treatment. He is no longer requiring frequent fluid boluses and is mobilizing some fluid.
   - IV fluid titration to blood pressure and urine output.
   - Continue cefepime, flagyl, and vancomycin to cover for neutropenic fever.
   - Follow up with blood and urine cultures.
   - Trend [Doctor First Name]/lipase etc.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient likely has atrial fibrillation due to fluid overload and atrial stretch. Autodiuresis will be allowed for now, and a PO regimen for long-term rate control will be considered. Anticoagulation is not recommended due to thrombocytopenia.
   - Diltiazem drip for now.
   - Convert to PO metoprolol when taking orally.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline renal function is undulating, but"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transitioning to leukemia. He presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and evidence of pancreatitis on labs and CT scan. The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, likely due to gallstone pancreatitis, and requires fluid management to stabilize his condition. Pain control is being managed with IV dilaudid in small doses. Central access has been withheld due to neutropenia. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for neutropenic fever.

Other assessments include acute kidney injury (ARF) likely caused by prerenal factors, hyperglycemia that has resolved, and delirium possibly caused by pain, sleep deprivation, opiates, and constipation. Aggressive pain management and improved sleep hygiene are planned to address the delirium.

The patient's medical history also includes congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35%. There are no current signs of fluid overload, and the patient is on careful hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently dispositioned to the ICU for further care."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. They have a history of acute pancreatitis, attributed to gallstones, and biliary obstruction due to gallstones. The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation, fever, delirium, fluid overload, pancytopenia, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure, and anemia. The patient is currently on various medications and interventions, including diltiazem drip for rate control in atrial fibrillation, broad-spectrum antibiotics for fever, narcotics for pain management, fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and the need for fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring of urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine is necessary to assess the progression of renal failure and guide further management.

2. Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of chronic CHF is evident from the reduced ejection fraction of 35%. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of CHF, such as increased fluid accumulation, shortness of breath, and fatigue, is crucial. Management should focus on optimizing heart function, reducing fluid overload, and addressing any precipitating factors.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing AFib, which is being managed"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis attributed to gallstones. This condition requires careful management and can lead to serious complications if not treated properly.

2. Biliary obstruction: The patient had a biliary obstruction due to gallstones, which was treated with ERCP with stenting. This procedure was likely performed to relieve the obstruction and prevent further complications.

3. Respiratory status: The patient has infiltrates on CXR, which may be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or low lung volumes. The patient requires increased FiO2 and monitoring.

4. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has improved rate control on iv diltiazem drip. It is important to manage AFIB to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

5. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but broad-spectrum antibiotics are still being given due to neutropenia. Monitoring for any signs of infection is crucial.

6. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have delirium, primarily due to medications (especially pain medications), perhaps toxic-metabolic, or ICU psychosis. The plan is to discontinue narcotics.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that has transitioned to leukemia. He presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and evidence of pancreatitis on labs and CT scan. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/56 to 146/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a baseline that is undulating.

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 0.7 thousand/mm^3, hemoglobin of 25.9 g/dL, platelet count of 47 thousand/mm^3, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, glucose level of 93 mg/dL, and sodium level of 138 mEq/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's amylase/lipase levels are improving, and he does not require fluid support. His pain seems minimal, and there is evidence of fluid mobilization suggesting an improvement in vascular leak. The plan is to advance clear liquids as tolerated.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is improving after autodiuresis"

- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transitioning to leukemia.
- He presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and evidence of pancreatitis on labs and CT scan.
- The patient's condition appears to be improving, as indicated by decreasing trends in amylase, lipase, and liver function tests (LFTs).
- He is no longer requiring frequent fluid boluses and seems to be mobilizing some fluids.
- The patient's blood pressure and urine output (UOP) are being carefully monitored due to his history of congestive heart failure (CHF).
- Antibiotic coverage is being continued for neutropenic fever.
- Blood and urine cultures are being followed up.
- Electrolyte repletion is being aggressively pursued.
- The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, likely due to fluid overload and atrial stretch. He is being allowed to autodiurese for now, and a PO regimen for long-term rate control will be considered. Anticoagulation is not an option given thrombocytopenia.
- Diltiazem drip is being used for rate control.
- The patient's renal function is undulating, but urine output has been good.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, attributed to gallstones.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- attributed to gallstones, perhaps passed.
   Clinically improved.
   BILIARY OBSTRUCTION -- attributed to gallstones; s/p ERCP with
   stenting.
   RESPIRATORY STATUS -- Infiltrates on CXR may be due to CHF, evolving
   ARDS or low lung volumes.  Requiring increased FiO2.  Monitor.
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) -- improved rate control, now back on po
   metoprolol.  Poor anticoagulaton candidate at this time (low plts)
   FEVER -- Resolved.  Continue broad spectrum antimirobials to complete
   course.
   PAIN REGIMEN -- No pain.  Monitor.
   DELERIUM --  much improved today, likely significant component of
   opiate-induced delerium.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of ICU psychosis. Monitor
   off narcotics.
   FLUIDS -- volume expanded.  Hope to net diurese --> now spontaneous
   diuresis.  Monitor for CHF.
   PANCYTOPENIA -- MDS underlying, perhaps leukemic transfomation.
   Neutropenia resolved.  Monitor.  GM-CSF not indicated.
   CHF - chronic, systolic EF= 35%.  Monitor for evidence of CHF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- improved with volume resussitation.  Continue
   fluid.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   ANEMIA -- Transfusing currently.  No evidence GI bleeding.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initate PO fluids, with supervision.
   ACTIVITY -- OOB to chair.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis. The patient's condition has shown improvement, but they continue to experience several medical complications. 

1. Respiratory status: The patient has infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or low lung volumes. The patient requires increased FiO2 and should be monitored closely.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's heart rhythm was previously uncontrolled, but it has now improved with rate control measures, including the use of metoprolol. However, the patient is not a good candidate for anticoagulation at this time due to low platelet count.

3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued until the course is completed.

4. Pain regimen: The patient is not experiencing any pain and should be monitored accordingly.

5. Delirium: The patient's delirium has improved significantly and is likely a component of opioid-induced delirium. It is recommended to monitor the patient and consider discontinuing narcotics.

6. Fluids: The patient has been volume expanded, and spontaneous diuresis has been observed. Monitoring for congestive heart failure (CHF) is necessary.

7. Pancytopenia: The patient's neutropenia has resolved, but monitoring is still required. GM-CSF is not indicated.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transitioning to leukemia. He presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and evidence of pancreatitis on labs and CT. The patient's current condition includes pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure (ARF), oxygen requirement, hyperglycemia, MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), delirium, and congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate pancreatitis. It is important to monitor his condition closely for any worsening symptoms or complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis or infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. It is crucial to manage this condition by controlling the heart rate and rhythm to prevent complications like stroke or heart failure.
3. Acute respiratory failure (ARF): The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires support. Monitoring oxygen saturation and ensuring adequate ventilation is essential to prevent further respiratory deterioration.
4. Oxygen requirement: The patient's ongoing need for supplemental oxygen indicates impaired gas exchange. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and adjustment of oxygen therapy are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels can increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing. Close monitoring and management of glycemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, attributed to gallstones, now with A-fib and
   delerium.
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) -- variable rate control, but not taking PO
   meds --> now back on po metoprolol. (Consider Digoxin).   Poor
   anticoagulaton candidate at this time (low plts).
   DELERIUM --  Continues to improve daily, attributed to opiate-induced
   delerium.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of ICU psychosis. Continue to monitor off
   narcotics.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- attributed to gallstones, perhaps passed.
   Clinically improved following ERCP.
   BILIARY OBSTRUCTION -- attributed to gallstones; s/p ERCP with
   stenting.
   RESPIRATORY STATUS -- Infiltrates on CXR may be due to CHF, evolving
   ARDS or low lung volumes.  Requiring increased FiO2.  Monitor.
   FEVER -- Resolved.  Continue broad spectrum antimirobials to complete
   course.
   PAIN REGIMEN -- No pain.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- volume expanded.  Hope to net diurese.  Monitor for CHF.
   PANCYTOPENIA -- MDS underlying, perhaps leukemic transfomation.
   Neutropenia resolved.  Monitor.  GM-CSF not indicated.
   CHF - chronic, systolic EF= 35%.  Monitor for evidence of CHF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- improved with volume resussitation.  Continue
   fluid.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   ANEMIA -- Transfusing currently.  No evidence GI bleeding.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initate PO fluids, with supervision.
   ACTIVITY -- OOB to chair.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The summary of the information is as follows:

- The patient has atrial fibrillation with a variable heart rate.
- There is no known drug allergy.
- The patient has received antibiotics (metronidazole, cefepime, vancomycin) in the past.
- The patient's mental status continues to improve.
- The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis attributed to gallstones, now with atrial fibrillation and delirium.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well controlled, but the patient is back on oral metoprolol.
- The patient is a poor candidate for anticoagulation due to low platelet count.
- The patient's delirium is attributed to opiate-induced delirium and should be monitored off narcotics.
- The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis and biliary obstruction attributed to gallstones, which was treated with ERCP.
- The patient requires increased FiO2 due to respiratory infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may be due to CHF, evolving ARDS, or low lung volumes.
- The patient had a fever that resolved, and broad-spectrum antibiotics will be completed.
- The patient has no pain and will be monitored.
- The patient's fluid balance needs to be monitored for CHF.
- The patient has pancytopenia, which may be due to myelodyspl"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, attributed to gallstones, now with A-fib and
   delerium.
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) -- variable rate control, but not taking PO
   meds --> now back on po metoprolol. (Consider Digoxin).   Poor
   anticoagulaton candidate at this time (low plts).
   DELERIUM --  Continues to improve daily, attributed to opiate-induced
   delerium.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of ICU psychosis. Continue to monitor off
   narcotics.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- attributed to gallstones, perhaps passed.
   Clinically improved following ERCP.
   BILIARY OBSTRUCTION -- attributed to gallstones; s/p ERCP with
   stenting.
   RESPIRATORY STATUS -- Infiltrates on CXR may be due to CHF, evolving
   ARDS or low lung volumes.  Requiring increased FiO2.  Monitor.
   FEVER -- Resolved.  Continue broad spectrum antimirobials to complete
   course.
   PAIN REGIMEN -- No pain.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- volume expanded.  Hope to net diurese.  Monitor for CHF.
   PANCYTOPENIA -- MDS underlying, perhaps leukemic transfomation.
   Neutropenia resolved.  Monitor.  GM-CSF not indicated.
   CHF - chronic, systolic EF= 35%.  Monitor for evidence of CHF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- improved with volume resussitation.  Continue
   fluid.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   ANEMIA -- Transfusing currently.  No evidence GI bleeding.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initate PO fluids, with supervision.
   ACTIVITY -- OOB to chair.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male MDS s/p gallstone pancreatitis and febrile neutrapenia
   .
   #. Gallstone Pancreatitis:  Pt. was initially admitted with elevated
   LFTs, bilirubin and amylase/lipase consistent with gallstone
   pancreatitis. He went to ERCP and sludge was extracted from the bile
   ducts and a plastic stent was placed without sphincterotomy. He
   initially required frequent fluid boluses to maintain his blood
   pressure but then began to autodiurese. Stable.  s/p ERCP
   autodiuresing.  Does not appear to be having a lot of pain currently.
   Enzymes had been trending downward.
   - Clear liquid diet advance as tolerated
   - Continue cefepime/flagyl/vanc covering for neutropenic fever until
   [**5-6**]
   -T rend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase etc.
   - electrolyte repletion
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation, with RVR: Improving after autodiuresis.  Patient
   had been refusing PO medications, and responded well to IV
   medications.  After becoming more lucid he was started on PO metoprolol
   for rate control and became somewhat bradycardic to the high 30s with
   HD stability.
   - PO metoprolol 25mg TID
 crush with apple sauce.
   .
   #.ARF: Undulating baseline, was prerenal on admission but then improved
   with IVF, UOP has been good.
   - Hold further fluids for now.
   .
   #O2 requirement: Improving w/  autodiuresis.
   - Goal negative 500cc-1L, give furosemide 10mg IV if not at goal
   # Hyperglycemia: Resolved
   -RISS for now
   .
   #. MDS/AML: Neutrapenia improving spontaneously likely not neutrapenic
   anymore. Literature supports GMCSF for neutrapenic fever in MDS if
   infection/fever not responding to Abx or with EPO to increase RBC
   production.
   - Hold on GMCSF for now as fever likely [**2-25**] pancreatitis
   .
   #Delerium: Pt. became delerioius the night after ERCP and intially this
   was attributed to pain but then did not improve w/ increased pain
   control so opiates were d/c
d. His delerium then began Improving w/
   sleep and holding opiates.  Patient answering questions currently and
   sometimes cooperative w/ exam.
   - Hold opiates
   - Improve sleep hygeine
   - Frequent reorientation during daylight hours
   - PT consult
   -OOB to chair during daylight
   .
   #. CHF: EF of 35%.
   -Hold ramipril as above
   -Careful HD monitoring.
   .
   FEN: Liquid diet, advance as tolerated.  IVF
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen not needed given diarrhea
   -Pain management standing tylenol

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of gallstone pancreatitis and febrile neutropenia. He presented with elevated liver function tests, bilirubin, and amylase/lipase levels, consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), where sludge was extracted from the bile ducts and a plastic stent was placed without sphincterotomy.

The patient initially required frequent fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure but then began to autodiurese. His vital signs show a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 110/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, bradycardia, irregular heart rhythm, clear lungs, soft abdomen with mild tenderness and bowel sounds present, and trace pitting edema in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 47 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 144 mg/dL, sodium level of 119 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and chloride level of 52 mg/dL. The patient's other lab values, including liver function tests, are also provided.

The patient's current assessment and plan include management of gallstone pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, oxygen requirement, hyperglycemia, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, delirium, congestive heart failure, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's renal function, further deterioration of his respiratory status leading to respiratory failure, progression of his congestive heart failure, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, and worsening of his myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be necessary to make a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, attributed to gallstones, now with A-fib and
   delerium.
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) -- improved rate not that patient taking PO
   meds.   Poor anticoagulaton candidate at this time (low plts).
   DELERIUM --  Delerium improved.  Now somewhat withdrawn.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   component of ICU psychosis. Continue to monitor off narcotics.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- attributed to gallstones, perhaps passed.
   Clinically improved following ERCP.
   BILIARY OBSTRUCTION -- attributed to gallstones; s/p ERCP with
   stenting.
   RESPIRATORY STATUS -- Infiltrates on CXR may be due to CHF, evolving
   ARDS or low lung volumes.  Improved.  Monitor.
   FEVER -- Resolved.  Continue broad spectrum antimirobials to complete
   course.
   PAIN REGIMEN -- No pain.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- volume expanded.  Hope to net diurese.  Monitor for CHF.
   PANCYTOPENIA -- MDS underlying, perhaps leukemic transfomation.
   Neutropenia resolved.  Monitor.  GM-CSF not indicated.
   CHF -- chronic, systolic EF= 35%.  Monitor for evidence of CHF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- improved with volume resussitation.  Continue
   fluid.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   ANEMIA -- Transfusing currently.  No evidence GI bleeding.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initate PO fluids, with supervision.
   ACTIVITY -- OOB to chair.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has atrial fibrillation which is better controlled with metoprolol. They experienced some bradycardia overnight but without hemodynamic compromise.
2. The patient's iv access was lost overnight, but they are now on room air with an SaO2 of 97%.
3. The patient is less cooperative today and appears withdrawn.
4. The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis attributed to gallstones, which has improved following ERCP.
5. The patient also has biliary obstruction attributed to gallstones, which was treated with ERCP with stenting.
6. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with infiltrates on CXR possibly due to CHF, evolving ARDS, or low lung volumes.
7. The patient previously had a fever, but it has resolved. They will continue with broad-spectrum antibiotics to complete the course.
8. The patient is pain-free and will be monitored.
9. The patient's fluids have been volume expanded, and they hope to net diurese. Monitor for CHF.
10. The patient has pancypopenia, which includes neutropenia that has resolved. Monitor for any signs of MDS or leukemic transformation. GM-CSF is not indicated.
11. The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%. Monitor for evidence of CHF.
12. The patient's acute renal failure has improved with volume resuscitation. Continue fluid management and monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
13. The patient has anemia, and they are currently transfusing. There is no evidence of GI bleeding.
14. The patient will initiate PO fluids with supervision.
15. The patient will be allowed out of bed to a chair.
16. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and elevation of the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
17. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU. They have spent a total of 35 minutes with the physician.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, leading to worsening ARDS or CHF.
2. Development of sepsis or secondary infections due to immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Progression of heart failure, resulting in cardiogenic shock.
4. Delayed healing or development of complications related to the patient's pancreatitis.
5. Recurrence of biliary obstruction or development of new biliary issues.
6. Persistent or worsening renal dysfunction leading to chronic kidney disease.
7. Failure to improve anemia or development of new hematological abnormalities.
8. Psychological distress and prolonged delirium.
9. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and hypercoagulable state.
10. Malnutrition or inadequate nutritional support.
11. Development of pressure ulcers or other complications related to immobility.

The Answer is (a) There are numerous potential medical complications that can arise for this patient in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. They have a history of acute pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation (AF), delirium, biliary obstruction, respiratory status concerns, fever, pain regimen, fluid management, pancytopenia, chronic heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure, anemia, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has been experiencing episodes of AF, which can lead to an irregular and often rapid heart rate. This may increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other cardiovascular complications.
2. Delirium: The patient's mental state is affected, leading to confusion, disorientation, and difficulty focusing. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, infections, and other complications.
3. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has had an episode of acute pancreatitis, which can cause severe abdominal pain, organ dysfunction, and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed properly.
4. Biliary Obstruction: The patient had a blockage in their bile duct, which can lead to jaundice, liver damage, and complications related to gallstones.
5. Respiratory Status: The patient has infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia or other lung issues. This can compromise oxygenation and ventilation, leading to respiratory failure.
6. Fever: The patient previously had a fever, which may indicate an infection or systemic inflammatory"

   #. Gallstone Pancreatitis:  Pt. was initially admitted with elevated
   LFTs, bilirubin and amylase/lipase consistent with gallstone
   pancreatitis. He went to ERCP and sludge was extracted from the bile
   ducts and a plastic stent was placed without sphincterotomy. He
   initially required frequent fluid boluses to maintain his blood
   pressure but then began to autodiurese. Stable.  s/p ERCP
   autodiuresing.  Does not appear to be having a lot of pain currently.
   Enzymes had been trending downward.
   - Clear liquid diet advance as tolerated
   - Continue cefepime/flagyl/vanc covering for neutropenic fever until

   #Atrial fibrillation, with RVR: Improving after autodiuresis.  Patient
   had been refusing PO medications, and responded well to IV
   medications.  After becoming more lucid he was started on PO metoprolol
   for rate control and became somewhat bradycardic to the high 30s with
   HD stability.
   - PO metoprolol 25mg TID

   #.ARF: Undulating baseline, was prerenal on admission but then improved
   with IVF, UOP has been good.

   #. MDS/AML: Neutrapenia improving spontaneously likely not neutrapenic
   anymore. Literature supports GMCSF for neutrapenic fever in MDS if
   infection/fever not responding to Abx or with EPO to increase RBC
   production.
   - Hold on GMCSF for now as fever likely [**2-25**] pancreatitis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis and febrile neutropenia. 

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) where sludge was extracted from the bile ducts and a plastic stent was placed without sphincterotomy. He initially required frequent fluid boluses to maintain his blood pressure but then began to autodiurese. His enzymes have been trending downward, indicating improvement in the gallstone pancreatitis.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) improved after autodiuresis. He was started on oral metoprolol for rate control and became somewhat bradycardic to the high 30s with hemodynamic stability.

The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) has an undulating baseline, initially appearing prerenal but then improving with intravenous fluids. Further fluid restriction is planned.

The patient's oxygen requirement is improving with autodiuresis. A goal of negative 500cc-1L fluid balance is desired, with the administration of furosemide 10mg IV if not achieved.

The patient's hyperglycemia has resolved, and he is currently being monitored closely.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, attributed to gallstones, now with A-fib and
   delerium.
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) -- improved rate not that patient taking PO
   meds.   Poor anticoagulaton candidate at this time (low plts).
   Continue meds prn (iv if required)
   DELERIUM --  Delerium improved.  Now somewhat withdrawn.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   component of ICU psychosis. Continue to monitor off narcotics.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- attributed to gallstones, perhaps passed.
   Clinically improved following ERCP.
   BILIARY OBSTRUCTION -- attributed to gallstones; s/p ERCP with
   stenting.
   RESPIRATORY STATUS -- Infiltrates on CXR may be due to CHF, evolving
   ARDS or low lung volumes.  Improved.  Monitor.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- free H2O deficti from reduced po intake.  Provice free
   H2O.  Encourage PO as delerium clears.
   FEVER -- Resolved.  Continue broad spectrum antimirobials to complete
   course.
   PAIN REGIMEN -- No pain.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- free water depleted.  Replete, monitor I/O.
   PANCYTOPENIA -- MDS underlying, perhaps leukemic transfomation.
   Neutropenia resolved.  Monitor.  GM-CSF not indicated.
   CHF -- chronic, systolic EF= 35%.  Monitor for evidence of CHF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- improved with volume resussitation.  Continue
   fluid.  Monitor UO, BUN, creat.
   ANEMIA -- Transfusing currently.  No evidence GI bleeding.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initate PO fluids, with supervision.
   ACTIVITY -- OOB to chair --> transfer to floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and delirium. The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis attributed to gallstones, which has improved following an ERCP procedure. There is also evidence of biliary obstruction due to gallstones, which was treated with an ERCP with stenting. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there are infiltrates on the chest X-ray that may be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or low lung volumes. The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia, likely due to free water deficiency from reduced oral intake. The patient previously had a fever, but it has resolved. The patient does not report any pain and is comfortable. Fluid balance is an issue, with a total fluid input of 2,737 mL and output of 1,055 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has pancytopenia, likely due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemic transformation. Chronic CHF is present, with a systolic ejection fraction of 35%. The patient has improved renal function, and anemia is being treated with transfusion. Nutritional support is being initiated with supervised PO fluids, and the patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening of CHF"
