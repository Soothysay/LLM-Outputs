","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, who underwent resection and posterior fixation. She also had a chronic, non-healing thoracic ulcer, paraspinal abscess, paraplegia at T10, osteomyelitis/diskitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to volume overload from PRBC transfusion, hypertension, paraspinal abscess/osteomyelitis, and a previous gastrointestinal bleed.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/66 to 154/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/A/C, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, vancomycin, cefepime, and Nutren 2.0 for nutrition.
- Imaging shows hazy opacification in both lungs consistent with layering effusions, and the endotracheal tube cannot be visualized on the single view presented.
- Microbiology results show negative blood cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, posterior fixation, chronic non-healing thoracic ulcer, paraspinal abscess, paraplegia at T10, osteomyelitis/diskitis. She has had several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure due to volume overload from PRBC transfusion, hypotension, paraspinal abscess/osteomyelitis, and poor swallowing.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to volume overload from PRBC transfusion. There is also concern for possible aspiration, but bedside bronch did not reveal any obstruction/consolidation.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension after intubation and sedation. She responded well to a 500 CC bolus and levophed, but her blood pressure is very sensitive to sedative medications.

3. Paraspinal Abscess/Osteomyelitis: The patient has a paraspinal abscess and osteomyelitis. She was previously on cefazolin for coag + staph in the wound, but the BCx negative to date. Further follow-up with neurosurg is recommended to discuss the appropriateness of surgery.

4. Poor Swallowing: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma who underwent resection and posterior fixation. She presented with a chronic, non-healing thoracic ulcer and was diagnosed with a paraspinal abscess with paraplegia at approximately T10, as well as osteomyelitis and diskitis. The patient's course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure (ARF) that has resolved, and respiratory failure.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 123/54 mmHg to 154/75 mmHg, heart rate between 67-100 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, pain management with fentanyl, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 301 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies are not mentioned in the provided note.

The patient's medical complications include hypotension, paraspinal abscess/osteomyelitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and an elevated INR. The healthcare team"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma who underwent resection and posterior fixation. She has chronic, non-healing thoracic ulcer and paraspinal abscess with paraplegia at approximately T10, osteomyelitis/diskitis. The patient's course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and now respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is on invasive ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.

2. Infection: The patient has a paraspinal abscess and osteomyelitis, for which she is currently on vancomycin and cefazolin. There is a possibility of ongoing infection or development of antibiotic resistance.

3. Hypertension: The patient is intermittently hypertensive at night, reaching systolic levels of 180. This needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive medication.

4. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload secondary to packed red blood cell transfusion. This should be closely monitored.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although no active bleeding is currently evident, there is a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of re-bleeding is important.

6. INR: The patient's INR was previously elevated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, who presented with a chronic non-healing thoracic ulcer, paraspinal abscess, and paraplegia at approximately T10. She also has osteomyelitis/diskitis and was previously diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but successfully extubated yesterday. She has multiple comorbidities including orthopedic device infection, chronic pain, dementia, coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to her poor baseline pulmonary reserve, kyphoscoliosis, bilateral pleural effusions, and previous failure to fully expand lungs. The hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely caused by volume overload secondary to packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.
2. Hypertension: The patient intermittently experiences high blood pressure in the evenings, reaching systolic levels of 180s. She is on metoprolol and labetalol IV as needed.
3. Paraspinal Abscess/Osteomyelitis: The patient has an ongoing paraspinal abscess and osteomyelitis. She has been"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, who underwent resection and posterior fixation. She also had a chronic, non-healing thoracic ulcer that resulted in a paraspinal abscess with paraplegia at approximately T10, as well as osteomyelitis and diskitis. The patient's course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypertension, dementia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- The patient's oxygen saturation levels have fluctuated between 100% on 2L oxygen and the high 80s-low 90s when weaned to 1L oxygen. She is still not fully recovering on 2L oxygen but is stable. She began sitting in the low 90s, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) was performed, showing a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 51, HCO3- of 71, BE of -32, and oxygen saturation of 95%. It was decided to keep her another night for observation.
- The patient received an additional 40mg IV lasix.
- Thoracentesis was planned for the next day.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The last doses of antibiotics were cefip"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, chronic non-healing thoracic ulcer, paraspinal abscess, paraplegia at T10, osteomyelitis/diskitis. The patient's course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute respiratory failure, and kidney injury. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely caused by volume overload secondary to PRBC transfusion in a patient with poor baseline pulmonary reserve.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pain control: The patient has acute and chronic pain due to orthopedic device infection, hardware infection, prosthetic joint, and orthopedic issues. Pain management will be addressed accordingly.
2. Respiratory failure: The most likely cause of the patient's respiratory failure is volume overload secondary to PRBC transfusion. The plan includes continuing diuresis, titrating lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1.5-2L daily, performing thoracentesis if needed, and monitoring ABG results.
3. Hypertension: The patient's intermittent hypertension at night needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive medications, such as metoprolol and lisinopril.
4. Paraspinal abscess/osteomyelitis: The patient was previously on cefazolin for coagulase-positive staphylococcus infection in the wound"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, chronic non-healing thoracic ulcer, paraspinal abscess with paraplegia at T10, osteomyelitis/diskitis. She presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. She has had several surgeries, including resection and posterior fixation of chondrosarcoma, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She also has a history of dementia and chronic kidney disease.

24-hour events:
- The patient's oxygen saturation dropped from 100% on 2L oxygen to the high 80s-low 90s when weaned to 1L oxygen, but it never fully recovered. She was ready to transfer but started saturating in the low 90s again. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 51, PaO2 of 71, HCO3- of 32, and BE of -4.
- She received an additional 40mg IV lasix.
- She will need thoracentesis tomorrow.
- Her last doses of antibiotics were cefipime and vancomycin.

Physical examination:
- General appearance: No acute distress.
- Eyes/Conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils equal, round, reactive to light).
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds (S1 and S2),"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has responded well to lasix diuresis over the past 24 hours. She
   will need continued ( but slow) attempts to mobilize effusions over the
   next week with furosemide. If she gets oliguric and is persistently
   dyspneic, we will proceed to large volume thoracentesis of left
   effusion. She will transition out of ICU today and have continued
   strict aspiration precautions maintained while she is on the floor.
   Pulm/ IP services to follow on floor too.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, who presented with a non-healing thoracic ulcer and paraspinal abscess resulting in paraplegia at the T10 level, osteomyelitis, and diskitis. The patient's course was complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute respiratory failure, and chronic kidney injury (CKI) that has since resolved. She has been intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU for respiratory failure.

24-hour events:
- The patient's oxygen saturation levels fluctuated throughout the day, initially being at 100% on 2L oxygen, then decreasing to the high 80s-low 90s when weaned to 1L oxygen. The patient's saturation levels did not fully recover on 2L oxygen but remained stable. The patient was ready to be transferred to the floor, but she began experiencing saturation levels in the low 90s. An arterial blood gas (ABG) test was performed, revealing a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, PaO2 of 71 mmHg, HCO3- of 32 mEq/L, and base excess of -4 mEq/L. It was decided to keep the patient in the ICU for another night to monitor her condition.
- The patient received an additional 40 mg IV Lasix to address fluid overload.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   We will continue gentle diuresis and keep NPO ( except meds) for now
   till S/S has been performed again. She is too frail to tolerate major
   spinal surgery and with current pulmonary/ metal status issues and
   anticipated post operative needs, a likely candidate for prolonged
   mechanical ventilation. She will need left effusion tapped with IP
   service
s help this week to help with resting dyspnea. She is ready to
   leave the ICU today and we will request team to discuss directives of
   care with HCP after neuro-surgical staff have opined regarding future
   operative needs/ candidacy.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, who underwent resection and posterior fixation. She presented with a chronic, non-healing thoracic ulcer, paraspinal abscess, paraplegia at T10, osteomyelitis/diskitis. Her course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute respiratory failure, and now respiratory failure again.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C
- Heart rate: 76 bpm
- Blood pressure: 137/69 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on nasal cannula

Laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 7.4 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 29.3%
- Platelet count: 389 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 81 mg/dL
- INR: 1.9

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- Neurologic exam: Essentially normal, including sensation in arms, pronator drift, and finger-to-nose test.
- No peripheral vascular or skin abnormalities noted.

The assessment and plan include:
- Pain control for acute and chronic pain.
- Orthopedic device infection, with plans for hardware removal.
- Acute respiratory failure, most likely due to volume overload secondary to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma who underwent resection and posterior fixation. She presented with a chronic, non-healing thoracic ulcer and developed a paraspinal abscess with paraplegia at T10, along with osteomyelitis and diskitis. The patient's course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute kidney injury (ARF), which has now resolved.

The patient is currently improving and has been successfully extubated. She is stable from a respiratory standpoint, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Paraspinal abscess/osteomyelitis: The patient is still on cefazolin for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus in the wound. She is afebrile, and further follow-up with neurosurgery and infectious disease recommendations is needed. It is important to monitor her wound care and continue with culture follow-up.

2. Hypertension: The patient has been intermittently hypertensive at night, with systolic readings in the 180s. She is currently on PO metoprolol, and IV labetalol is given as needed.

3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL and a decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 29"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma who underwent resection and posterior fixation. She also has a chronic, non-healing thoracic ulcer and has presented with a paraspinal abscess with paraplegia at around T10, along with osteomyelitis and diskitis. The patient's course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute kidney injury (ARF), which has now resolved. 

24-hour events:
- The patient was extubated and doing well.
- A discussion about hardware removal in the operating room when the patient is stable needs to be addressed with neurosurgery.
- The patient experienced confusion in the afternoon, feeling like she was falling when lying in bed. A brief neurological exam was performed, which showed normal results, with intact sensation in the arms, pronator drift, and finger-to-nose test.
- The patient was agitated at night and received 0.25 mg of Haldol.
- An extra dose of lasix was given, resulting in a negative balance of 1 liter.
- The patient received antibiotics (vancomycin and cefazolin) as per infection control recommendations.

Vital signs and lab results:
- Vital signs: Temperature within normal range, heart rate slightly elevated but within normal limits, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation at 97%.

   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure
 Most likely cause is volume
   overload secondary to PRBC transfusion in patient with poor baseline
   pulmonary reserve given previous kyphoscoliosis, bilateral effusion and
   inability to fully expand lungs as previously noted in pulmonary
   consultation.  Successful extubation, has been stable from respiratory
   standpoint.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   -will do thoracentesis in AM
   -f/u cultures
   -continue diuresis for goal of 1 L negative per day
   # Hypertension
 Patient intermittently hypertensive at night, to 180's
   systolic
   -on PO metoprolol
   -labetalol IV PRN
   .
   # Paraspinal abscess/osteomyelitis -  Patient was on cefazolin for Coag
   + staph in wound.  TEE neg for vegetations; BCx negative to date.
   Afebrile. Currently on both vancomycin and cefazolin.
   - Fup with neurosurg/general surgery re: appropriateness for surgery;
   if general surgery will debride, neurosurg can take out hardware
   - continue wound care
   - f/u ID recs
   -f/u cultures
   - will d/c vancomycin and narrow to just cefazolin since afebrile/no
   white count
   .
   # GI bleed
 no evidence of active bleeding.  GI signed off.
   - continue pantoprazole IV BID
   .
   # INR
 Patient
s INR increased to 4.0 several days ago and pt was
   given Vit K 5 mg and FFP 4 units.  INR1.4.
   -  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG  - on  metoprolol. Discontinued aspirin [**2-4**] recent
   GIB.
   .
   # Dementia  - Continue Aricept.
   .
   # FEN
 minimize IVF if possible, NPO  -- pt noted to have unsafe
   swallow prior to intubation
 S/S recommended dysphagia diet. Pt was
   noted to have poor swallowing during meals. Soft meals with thickened
   liquids with 1:1 observation during meals per Nutrition recs. No
   aspiration seen on video swallow study.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chondrosarcoma, who underwent resection and posterior fixation. She presented with a chronic, non-healing thoracic ulcer and developed a paraspinal abscess with paraplegia at T10, along with osteomyelitis and diskitis.
- The patient's course has been complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure (ARF), and respiratory failure. She is currently improving.
- The patient has been extubated and is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula.
- She is confused and experienced feelings of falling when lying in bed, but her neurologic exam was essentially normal, with intact sensation in the arms, pronator drift, and finger-to-nose test.
- The patient was agitated at night and received haloperidol (Haldol).
- She received an extra dose of lasix in the afternoon and early morning, with negative fluid balance of 1 liter.
