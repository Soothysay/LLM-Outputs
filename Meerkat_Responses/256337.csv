","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old lady who underwent Zenker's diverticulum repair and was found to have a leak on upper gastrointestinal (UGI) study. She also underwent distal esophageal defect repair. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is intubated for procedures due to concerns about airway edema. She has been experiencing hypotension, which resolved with a decrease in propofol dose. The patient has been given clindamycin and fluconazole prophylaxis, and her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mediastinitis: The patient underwent surgery to repair a distal esophageal defect and Zenker's diverticulum. There is a need to monitor for possible mediastinitis, which is an infection of the chest cavity.
2. Airway Edema: The patient has concerns about airway edema after intubation. Close monitoring and consultation with the ENT specialist prior to extubation are necessary to ensure proper airway management.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, most likely due to propofol infusion. Continuous monitoring is required to maintain stable blood pressure levels.
4. Infection: The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics (clindamycin and fluconazole) due to the risk of surgical site infection. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection is crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient with history of A fib, now with
   hypotension secondary to tachycardia. Limited heart rate response to
   beta blocker with worsening hypotension, would favor not using for HR
   control, especially given NPO status and need for IV administration.
   Would use CCB however serum calcium low and ejection fraction is not
   known; will obtain ionized calcium and discontinue diltiazem.
   Appreciate cardiology recommendations, will start amiodarone at low
   dose with 24 hour infusion of 800mg. If heart rate increases causing
   hypotension, would consider using IV beta blocker.
   HYPOTENSION: Given A fib with RVR, this is the most likely etiology,
   but would also consider infection/sepsis, especially in setting of
   known leakage of esophageal contents into mediastinium. Continue
   Clindamycin and fluconazole, however suspect will need broader coverage
   of gram negatives and anaerobes. ID consult placed, appreciate their
   input. Would also consider pericardial effusion as discussed below.
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: Concerning given above risk of mediastinitis, consider
   expanding antibiotics

   PACER LEAD RIGHT VENTRICULAR PERFORATION: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 17**] records, this
   was evaluated but unclear if repair took place. Given ongoing
   hypotension will obtain stat echo to evaluate for pericardial effusion
   / tamponade.
   SURGICAL BLEEDING: Patient with sanguinous drainage from JP drain in
   anterior neck. Also with firm anterior neck and with pain around site.
   Will monitor closely with low threshold for repeating imaging. CT scan
   this AM revealed a question of sub-optimal Zenker
s repair and a poorly
   identified peri-esophageal soft tissue mass.
   -- Type and crossed
   -- If bleeding continues, will need repeat CT, surgical evaluation.
   -- Monitor airway closely given concern for anterior neck compartment
   syndrome
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY): Serum osm of 265 would
   strongly argue against hypovolemic hyponatremia. Differential diagnosis
   for hyponatremia includes SIADH, central salt wasting and heart failure
   or other sodium avid state. Given bilateral pleural effusions, recent
   intrathoracic procedures would suspect SIADH is the most likely cause.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing hypotension secondary to tachycardia. There is limited response to beta-blocker therapy due to worsening hypotension, so amiodarone infusion has been started.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which could be indicative of infection or sepsis, especially considering the known leakage of esophageal contents into the mediastinum. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and an infectious disease consult has been placed.

Additionally, there is a concern for right ventricular pacing lead perforation, pericardial effusion, and surgical bleeding from the anterior neck drain site. A stat echocardiogram has been ordered to evaluate for pericardial effusion/tamponade. Close monitoring is necessary, with low threshold for repeating imaging if bleeding continues. Surgical evaluation may be required, and airway monitoring is crucial due to the concern for anterior neck compartment syndrome.

The patient also has hypotension, possibly due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, but other causes such as infection/sepsis or pericardial effusion should be considered. Diltiazem has been discontinued due to low serum calcium levels.

There is evidence of hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), and the differential diagnosis includes SIADH, central salt"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of Zenker's diverticulum, who underwent endoscopic repair complicated by esophageal rupture and subsequently had an open neck repair on POD 3. The patient is currently in the ICU and experiencing various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing hypotension secondary to tachycardia. Despite being started on amiodarone drip and reverting back into sinus rhythm, the patient went back into atrial fibrillation during rounds. Treatment options include giving metoprolol IV and considering starting digoxin.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, but other possible causes such as infection/sepsis should also be considered, especially in the setting of known leakage of esophageal contents into the mediastinum. IV fluid boluses have been administered when the patient's blood pressure drops.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is concerning given the risk of mediastinitis. It is recommended to expand antibiotics and obtain an infectious disease consultation to consider broader coverage of gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 31% to 26%, indicating possible anemia. The most likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 83 y/o woman with history of Zenker's diverticulum, now
   status post endoscopic repair complicated by esophageal rupture,
   followed by open neck repair, POD 3.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient with history of A fib, now with
   hypotension secondary to tachycardia. Limited heart rate response to
   beta blocker with worsening hypotension, would favor not using for HR
   control, especially given NPO status and need for IV administration.
   Per cardiology recommendations pt was started on amiodorone drip, and
   reverted back into sinus. Pt was in sinus until rounds when whe went
   back into afib
   - give metop 5 IV x1, MR2
   - IVF: 500ml bolus b/c of pt
s associated hypotension
   - will likely start digoxin today
   - f/u cardiology recs
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Given A fib with RVR, this is the most
   likely etiology, but would also consider infection/sepsis, especially
   in setting of known leakage of esophageal contents into mediastinium-
   IVF boluses when drops w/ afib
   #  LEUKOCYTOSIS: Concerning given above risk of mediastinitis, consider
   expanding antibiotics. . Continue Clindamycin and fluconazole, however
   suspect will need broader coverage of gram negatives and anaerobes. ID
   consult placed, appreciate their input.
   -- F/U ID Consult
   # ANEMIA: Pt
s hct dropped from 31 to 26, and new labs pending.
   Hematoma at sugical site would be greatest concern, but no signs of
   stridor or airway compression.
   - continue to moniter
   - stool guaics
   # PLEURAL EFFUSION: Pt has leukocytosis and pleural effusion. Will
   speak to thoracics on whether a thoracentesis would be useful for
   diagnositic purposes.
   #  PACER LEAD RIGHT VENTRICULAR PERFORATION: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 17**] records, this
   was evaluated but unclear if repair took place. Given ongoing
   hypotension will obtain stat echo to evaluate for pericardial effusion
   / tamponade.
   #  SURGICAL BLEEDING: Patient with sanguinous drainage from JP drain in
   anterior neck. Also with firm anterior neck and with pain around site.
   Will monitor closely with low threshold for repeating imaging. CT scan
   this AM revealed a question of sub-optimal Zenker
s repair and a poorly
   identified peri-esophageal soft tissue mass.
   -- Type and crossed
   -- If bleeding continues, will need repeat CT, surgical evaluation.
   -- Monitor airway closely given concern for anterior neck compartment
   syndrome
   #   HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY): Serum osm of 265 would
   strongly argue against hypovolemic hyponatremia. Differential diagnosis
   for hyponatremia includes SIADH, central salt wasting and heart failure
   or other sodium avid state. Given bilateral pleural effusions, recent
   intrathoracic procedures would suspect SIADH is the most likely cause.
   - continue fluid restriction
   - continue to moniter as pt no longer getting D5
   Zenker's diverticulum and then esophageal defect repaired in OR.
   Strictly NPO given high concern for leakage
   -- Monitor closely

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of Zenker's diverticulum who underwent endoscopic repair, which was complicated by esophageal rupture. She subsequently had an open neck repair on POD 3. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation (AF), hypotension, leukocytosis, anemia, pleural effusion, pacer lead right ventricular perforation, surgical bleeding, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of AF and is currently experiencing hypotension secondary to tachycardia. There is limited heart rate response to beta-blockers, and the patient's NPO status and need for IV administration may preclude the use of metoprolol. Amiodarone has been started as per cardiology recommendations, but the patient reverted back into AF during rounds.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to AF with rapid ventricular response, infection/sepsis, or other causes. IV fluid boluses have been given when the patient's blood pressure drops, especially during episodes of AF.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which raises concerns for infection or mediastinitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and an infectious disease consult has been placed.

4. Anemia: The patient"
