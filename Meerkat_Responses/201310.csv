   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The note mentions several events that occurred within a 24-hour period.

Firstly, at 09:15 AM on [**2165-3-17**], blood cultures were taken. Then, a PICC line was started at 09:52 AM on the same day. At 11:30 AM, an endoscopy was performed, which showed severe hemorrhagic gastritis in the body of the stomach. This likely indicates the source of bleeding, considering the patient's use of Coumadin, ASA, and Plavix.

The patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), with two of them being essentially half units. Additionally, one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was given. The patient was evaluated by hematology/oncology and was not felt to be in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), so factor IX was not given.

The patient has no known drug allergies. Antibiotics were administered, including vancomycin at 01:00 PM on [**2165-3-17**], cefipime at 03:00 PM on the same day, and erythromycin at 04:00 AM on [**2165-3-18**].

The patient is currently on several infusions, including lidocaine at 2 mg/min and"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 14636**] is a 67 YOM with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM, Afib, and
   schizophrenia who presented with inferior STEMI managed medically, who
   developed melena, Hct drop, and positive NG lavage consistent with
   upper GIB.
   .
   # GIB: Likely upper bleed given melena, nausea, and + NG lavage.  Pt
   complaining of abdominal pain and still having melanotic stools. GI,
   Surgery, and IR all have been notified.  Bleeding may be from
   gastritis, peptic ulcer, dulafoy lesion, [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] (although no hx
   of emesis).  Most likely from supratheraputic INR (although this does
   not explain the abdominal pain.  Lower GI source less likely because no
   hematochezia but DDX would include colitis, enteritis, AV
   malformations, diverticulosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia. He presented with an inferior STEMI that was managed medically, and he also developed melena, a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct), and positive nasogastric (NG) lavage consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring due to his unstable condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has melena and positive NG lavage indicating an upper GIB. The source of bleeding could be from gastritis, peptic ulcer, or a Dulafoy lesion. The patient's INR was initially elevated, which may have contributed to the bleeding.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray, suggestive of pneumonia. This could be healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient developed nonsustained VT during hypovolemia from acute blood loss. It is likely due to ischemic or periinfarction ischemia leading to an irritable ventricular focus.
4. Myocardial Infarction: The patient had an inferior STEMI that was managed medically due to his inability to consent to catheterization and the long time"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia.

The patient presented with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that was managed medically. The patient then developed melena, a drop in hematocrit (Hct), and positive nasogastric (NG) lavage, indicating an upper GI bleed. The patient is complaining of abdominal pain and still experiencing melanic stools. 

The patient has multiple medical issues, including pneumonia, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. 

The patient has been managed with various medications and interventions, including pantoprazole infusion, vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion, and blood product transfusion. The patient's INR has been corrected from a supratherapeutic level of 5.2 to 3.2. 

The patient's mental status has improved, and the fever is likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's diabetes management includes fingerstick glucose monitoring, insulin administration, and medication adjustments. 

The patient also has a seizure disorder and is being treated with levetiracetam. The patient's atrial fibr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia. He presented with symptoms of an inferior STEMI, which was managed medically. He also developed melena, hematochezia, and positive NG lavage, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is currently unable to provide consent for medical treatment. His legal representative has been consulted, and interventions that are considered reasonable can be performed. The patient has a DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has fever and respiratory symptoms, which may indicate pneumonia. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient developed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, likely secondary to ischemia from the recent STEMI. It is important to monitor and manage his cardiac rhythm.
3. Myocardial Infarction: The patient had an inferior STEMI, and further evaluation of his cardiac function is necessary.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's symptoms suggest upper gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to severe hemorrhagic gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. Endoscopy is planned to assess and potentially treat the source of bleeding.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and reduced platelet count, indicating coagulopathy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia. He presented with an inferior STEMI that was managed medically due to his inability to consent to catheterization. He also developed melena, a drop in hematocrit, and positive nasogastric lavage consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely hospital-acquired. He also has monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is likely secondary to an irritable focus induced by active ischemia in the setting of recent STEMI. 

The patient's altered mental status is improving, most likely secondary to lidocaine and other sedatives such as morphine. He has an altered mental status due to a seizure disorder and is currently on levetiracetam 500 mg every 12 hours. 

The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, and he requires insulin therapy. His atrial fibrillation is being managed with medications, but his current regimen includes warfarin, which is contraindicated due to his coagulopathy. 

The patient's hypertension is being monitored, but his current antihypertensive medications are being held due to the gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for further complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with inferior STEMI, managed medically. The patient developed melena, a drop in hematocrit (Hct), and positive nasogastric (NG) lavage consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient is complaining of abdominal pain and still having melanotic stools. The bleeding may be from gastritis, peptic ulcer, or a Dulafoy lesion. Lower GIB is less likely, but possible causes include colitis, enteritis, arteriovenous malformations, and diverticulosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (Vtach): The patient developed Vtach in the setting of hypovolemia from acute blood loss. This could be due to ischemic or peri-infarction ischemia leading to an irritable ventricular focus.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
3. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient had an inferior resolving STEMI and is currently being managed medically due to the inability to consent to catheterization.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR of 5.2, which has been corrected to 3.2 after vitamin K administration and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion. The patient also has antibodies to blood products and requires"

   # GIB: Likely upper bleed given melena, nausea, and + NG lavage.  Pt
   complaining of abdominal pain and still having melanotic stools. GI,
   Surgery, and IR all have been notified.  Bleeding may be from
   gastritis, peptic ulcer, dulafoy lesion, [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] (although no hx
   of emesis).  Most likely from supratheraputic INR (although this does
   not explain the abdominal pain.  Lower GI source less likely because no
   hematochezia but DDX would include colitis, enteritis, AV
   malformations, diverticulosis.
   -- continue pantoprazole 40mg IV BID

   from heroic life prolonging measures such as CPR that the pt likely
   would not want.

   # STEMI: Had inferior resolving STEMI by the time he presented to

   catheterization and length of time between MI and presentation for

   valproate (chronically lives in 50s-100s) and now with pantoprazole
   infusion possibly contributing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia. He presented with inferior STEMI and was managed medically. The patient developed melena, hematochezia, and a positive NG lavage, indicating an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The bleeding source is likely from gastritis or peptic ulcer, and the patient has been on pantoprazole IV BID and Carafate slurry. The patient's Hct dropped, and he received one unit of packed red blood cells. His INR was corrected with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 67,000, which may be medication-induced. He received one unit of platelets. The patient's mental status is improving, and he is on multiple antibiotics for pneumonia and sepsis. His diabetes is being managed with insulin and oral medications. He has a history of seizure disorder, hypertension, and schizophrenia. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, Carafate slurry, insulin, Levetiracetam, and various other medications for his medical conditions. The patient's social situation is complex, and there is a question regarding his healthcare power of attorney. The patient has a DNR/DNI status."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 14636**] is a 67 YOM with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM, Afib, and
   schizophrenia who presented with inferior STEMI managed medically, who
   developed melena, Hct drop, and positive NG lavage consistent with
   upper GIB.
   .
   # GIB: Likely upper bleed given melena, nausea, and + NG lavage.  Pt
   complaining of abdominal pain and still having melanotic stools. GI,
   Surgery, and IR all have been notified.  Bleeding may be from
   gastritis, peptic ulcer, dulafoy lesion, [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] (although no hx
   of emesis).  Most likely from supratheraputic INR (although this does
   not explain the abdominal pain.  Lower GI source less likely because no
   hematochezia but DDX would include colitis, enteritis, AV
   malformations, diverticulosis.
   -- continue pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   -- Monitor HCT for another 24 hours, if remains stable, pt can be
   called out to floor tomorrow
   -- INR corrected
   -- transfuse to goal HCT of >30
   -- Give one unit of platelets as may not have functioning platelets
   from aspirin
   -- Hct checks Q12H
   -- maintain IV access with 2 large bore IVs plus 20 gauge and PICC
   -- Consider IV fluids if needed for blood pressure (although currently
   hemodynamically stable)
   -- Can cautiously advance to clears diet with carafate slurry
   -- F/u H Pylori serology

   # Vtach: developed in setting of hypovolemia from acute blood loss.
   Likley ischemic or periinfarction ischemia leading to irritable
   ventricular focus. Short runs of NSVT overnight.

   -- Would continue to hold Lidocane drip as pt now with 24 hours of
   hemodynamic stability
   -- Monitor tele
   -- Replete lytes Mg>2, K>4, recheck lytes in PM
   # Social issues - HCP on record at his nursing home is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 987**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2372**],
   but she says that she never agreed or signed anything saying that she
   would be his HCP. She is not his daughter as recorded by the [**Name (NI) 333**], is not
   related to his family at all. Does not have any children, spouse, or
   next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] that he is in contact with. [**Name2 (NI) **] has two estranged brothers,
   but [**Name (NI) 987**] and his [**Name (NI) 333**] does not know their names or any contact

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia. He presented with an inferior STEMI that was managed medically due to his inability to consent to catheterization. The patient developed melena, a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct), and positive nasogastric lavage consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He also has altered mental status, abdominal distension, fever, thrombocytopenia, and is on multiple medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and is at risk for arrhythmias, including VT.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and worsening left lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia.
3. Myocardial infarction (MI): The patient's history of CAD and recent STEMI increase the risk of recurrent MI.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's melena, positive NG lavage, and severe erythema and petechiae in the stomach consistent with hemorrhagic gastritis indicate ongoing GIB.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be medication-induced or due to disseminated intravascular coagulation ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia. He presented with an inferior STEMI, which was managed medically. The patient developed melena, a drop in hematocrit (Hct), and positive nasogastric (NG) lavage consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB):
   - The patient has melena and positive NG lavage, indicating an upper GIB.
   - EGD confirmed severe hemorrhagic gastritis, likely the source of bleeding.
   - Pantoprazole infusion was continued, and the INR was corrected.
   - The patient received a blood transfusion to achieve a Hct of >30.
   - Fluid resuscitation with IV fluids may be needed for blood pressure management.
   - The patient can be advanced to a full liquid diet with carafate slurry.

2. Tachycardia:
   - The patient experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia (Vtach).
   - Tachycardia may be secondary to intravascular depletion and agitation.
   - A 12-lead ECG should be obtained.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO Q"

","The patient's medical history and current condition indicate several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia due to his compromised immune system and prolonged stay in the ICU.

2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.

3. Myocardial infarction (heart attack): The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, specifically an inferior STEMI, indicating a blockage in the coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart.

4. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely caused by severe hemorrhagic gastritis and possibly related to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, and there is a risk of developing DKA, characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can lead to infections and complications if not properly managed.

7. Renal failure: The patient may be experiencing acute renal failure, indicated by declining kidney function and elevated creatinine levels.

8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and schizophrenia. He presented with an inferior STEMI managed medically, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's current condition includes ventricular tachycardia (VT), pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has melena and a positive nasogastric (NG) lavage, indicating upper GIB. There is severe hemorrhagic gastritis, and the INR is elevated, which could be the source of bleeding. The patient is being treated with pantoprazole and vitamin K to correct the INR and maintain it within therapeutic range. 

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count of 67, which could be medication-induced from valproate and pantoprazole. The platelet count improved after transfusion.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has anuria and worsening renal function. This may be secondary to hypoperfusion due to severe GI bleed. Further evaluation with urine analysis and renal ultrasound is needed.

4. Ventricular Tachycard"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been admitted with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, previous myocardial infarction, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/62 mmHg to 130/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including lisinopril, metoprolol, pantoprazole, diltiazem, furosemide, carafate, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate.

The patient underwent an EKG to evaluate atrial fibrillation and also had a nuclear exercise treadmill test (ETT) which showed no perfusion defect but estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 34%. Additionally, the patient had an echocardiogram (echo) performed by their primary care physician (PCP), which revealed an LVEF of 60% with no wall motion abnormalities (WMA). A cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) was also obtained, showing some endocardial enhancement in the left anterior descending (LAD) territory consistent with an ischemic insult.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient presented with a chief complaint of GI bleed. Upon admission, they were found to have atrial fibrillation (AFib) and were started on lisinopril and metoprolol. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% without wall motion abnormalities. A nuclear stress test was also performed, which showed no perfusion defects and estimated LVEF on the same day as 34%. A cardiac MRI indicated some endocardial enhancement in the left anterior descending (LAD) territory, consistent with an ischemic insult. The patient was given one dose of Ambien for insomnia.

In terms of medications, the patient was receiving pantoprazole, diltiazem, furosemide, carafate, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate. They had no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Review of systems revealed unchanged information from admission except for the addition of new symptoms. The patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 102 bpm (normal range 78-134 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 104/62 mmHg to 130/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute ("

   Mr. [**Known lastname 14636**] is a 67 YOM with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM, Afib, and
   schizophrenia who presented with inferior STEMI managed medically, who
   developed melena, Hct drop, and positive NG lavage consistent with
   upper GIB.
   .
   # GIB: Likely upper bleed given melena, nausea, and + NG lavage.  Pt
   complaining of abdominal pain and still having melanotic stools.  EGD
   confirms severe hemorrhagic gastritis and in setting of
   supratherapeutic INR most likely source of bleed. No longer having
   melena. H Pylori negative.
   -- continue pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   -- INR corrected
   -- transfuse to goal HCT of >30
   -- 1 unit platelets given yesterday
   -- Hct checks [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- maintain IV access with 2 large bore IVs plus 20 gauge and PICC
   -- Consider IV fluids if needed for blood pressure (although currently
   hemodynamically stable)
   -- Can cautiously advance to regular diet with carafate slurry
   .
   # Tachycardia: Most likely atrial tachycardia with variable conduction.
   Dehydration, hypoxia, or fever unlikely triggers. Trigger was most
   likely adrenergic surge in setting of agitation. Ddx includes a
   flutter.
   -- Obtain 12 lead to confirm
   -- Continue dilt 90mg PO QID for now
   -- Treat underlying agitation as before
   -- Continue metoprolol 25mg PO Q8H
   -- No need for cardioversion now
   # Vtach: developed in setting of hypovolemia from acute blood loss.
   Likley ischemic or periinfarction ischemia leading to irritable
   ventricular focus. No more sustained V tach for 48 hours.
   -- Would continue to hold Lidocane drip as pt now with 48 hours of
   hemodynamic stability
   -- Monitor tele
   -- Replete lytes Mg>2, K>4
   # Social issues - HCP on record at his nursing home is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 987**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2372**],
   but she says that she never agreed or signed anything saying that she
   would be his HCP. She is not his daughter as recorded by the [**Name (NI) 333**], is not
   related to his family at all. Does not have any children, spouse, or
   next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] that he is in contact with. [**Name2 (NI) **] has two estranged brothers,
   but [**Name (NI) 987**] and his [**Name (NI) 333**] does not know their names or any contact
   information. [**Name2 (NI) **] at this point is not consentable. He made his
   DNR/DNI decision 2 years ago when he was still deemed competent to make
   decisions per his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 3062**]. Legal was consulted and states that
   interventions that are ""reasonable"" can be done, which is different
   from heroic life prolonging measures such as CPR that the pt likely
   would not want.
   - Legal recs
   .
   # STEMI: Had inferior resolving STEMI by the time he presented to
   [**Hospital1 19**].  He has been managed medically due to inability to consent to
   catheterization and length of time between MI and presentation for
   cath.
   -- hold aspirin, plavix, given bleeding --> will likely restart ASA 1
   week after resolution
   -- continue atorvastatin
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Supratheraputic INR 5.2 --> 3.2
 1.3 after vitamin K
   10 mg and FFP x 4.  Platelets are also reduced at 67 (and have been as
   low as 42). also has antibodies to blood products and requires special
   ""rare"" blood
   -- trend INR
   -- continue to hold warfarin, plavix, and aspirin, pt probably failed
   warfarin and plavix for life, may restart baby aspirin 1 week after
   resolution
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved after transfusion. Most likely medication
   induced from combination of valproate (chronically lives in 50s-100s)
   and now with pantoprazole infusion possibly contributing.
   -- Change pantoprazole to IV BID
   -- Monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Likely caused by multiple
   transfusions. Not a significant oxygen requirement. Given uncertain
   abdominal pathology and tachycardia.
   -- Hold on lasix until tomorrow
   # ARF: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion in setting of severe GI
   bleed, however, unclear why continuing to worsen.
   -- Renal consult
   -- Analyze urine sediment with renal
   -- Renal U/S
   -- Adjust vanc dosing
   -- Change to renal diet
   # Altered mental status: Improving, most likely secondary to lidocaine
   and other sedatives such as morphine.
   -- Continue to hold lidocaine
   -- Restart home psych regimen once mental status clears
   -- Monitor
   # Abdominal distension: Most likely gas from EGD vs constipation. No
   significant TTP, quiet bowel sounds, perforated gastric ulcer unlikely
   given no sign of ulcer on EGD.
   -- Serial abdominal exams (have been remaining stable)
   -- repeat KUB
   -- Low threshold to obtain CT abdomen without contrast
   # Fever: Resolved. Likely from aspiration PNA.
   -- Vanc/zosyn now, Day 1 = [**2165-3-17**], day [**4-6**]
   -- Obtain sputum
   -- blood culture
   -- urine culture-- continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   #  Diabetes:
   -- fingersticks QID
   -- insulin SS at full dose
   -- lantus at full dose
   -- hold glyburide

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and schizophrenia.
- He presented with an inferior STEMI that was managed medically due to his inability to consent to catheterization.
- He developed melena, a drop in hemoglobin concentration, and positive nasogastric (NG) lavage consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- Endoscopy confirmed severe hemorrhagic gastritis, which is likely the source of bleeding. His H. pylori test was negative.
- The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction, pneumonia, ventricular tachycardia (Vtach), and altered mental status.
- He has impaired skin integrity and requires special ""rare"" blood due to antibodies to blood products.
- His renal function is deteriorating, and he has thrombocytopenia.
- The patient's mental status is improving, and he is being weaned off sedatives.
- He has abdominal distension, which is likely due to gas from the endoscopy rather than constipation.
- His fever has resolved, and he no longer has a fever.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Mr. [**Known lastname 14636**] is a 67 YOM with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM, Afib, and
   schizophrenia who presented with inferior STEMI managed medically, who
   developed melena, Hct drop, and positive NG lavage consistent with
   upper GIB.
   .
   # ARF: Now oliguric. Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion in setting
   of severe GI bleed, however, unclear why continuing to worsen. Ddx
   includes vancomycin toxicity given supratherapeutic levels, vs zosyn
   toxicity.
   -- Renal consult
   -- Reanalyze urine sediment with renal
   -- Renal U/S
   -- Adjust vanc and zosyn dosing
   -- Discuss with renal if either abx is a possible culprit then will
   have to readjust HAP dosing
   -- Change to renal diet
   -- Renally dose remainder of medications
   # GIB: Likely upper bleed given melena, nausea, and + NG lavage.  Pt
   complaining of abdominal pain and still having melanotic stools. EGD
   confirms severe hemorrhagic gastritis and in setting of
   supratherapeutic INR most likely source of bleed. No longer having
   melena. H Pylori negative.
   -- continue pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   -- INR corrected
   -- transfuse only if HCT unstable to goal >30 if possible
   -- Hct check [**Hospital1 7**] given trend downward
   -- maintain IV access with 2 large bore IVs plus 20 gauge and PICC
   -- Consider IV fluids if needed for blood pressure (although currently
   hemodynamically stable)
   -- Can cautiously advance to regular cardiac, renal, and diabetic diet
   with carafate slurry
   .
   # Tachycardia: Most likely atrial tachycardia with variable conduction.
   Dehydration, hypoxia, or fever unlikely triggers. Trigger was most
   likely adrenergic surge in setting of agitation. Ddx includes a
   flutter.
   -- Continue dilt 90mg PO QID for now
   -- Treat underlying agitation as before
   -- Continue metoprolol 50mg PO Q8H
   -- No need for cardioversion now
   -- Monitor telemetry
   # Acute on chronic heart failure: Most likely secondary to blood and
   fluid given in setting of GI bleed with likely RV failure from probable
   inferior MI.
   -- Recommend lasix 60mg IV ONCE and titrate to goal negative 1L
   -- PM Lytes
   -- Monitor Is/Os
   -- Low sodium diet
   -- Continue rate control
   -- Recommend renal U/S to look for ascites
   # Vtach: developed in setting of hypovolemia from acute blood loss.
   Likely ischemic or periinfarction ischemia leading to irritable
   ventricular focus. No more sustained V tach for 48 hours.  Resolved.
   # Altered mental status: Patient with baseline yelling and confusion,
   unclear whether on appropriate regimen for presumed diagnosis of
   schizophrenia as pt not on any antipsychotics. Ie, trazadone seems a
   strange medicine for presumed schizophrenia.
   --  Psychiatry regimen to optimize his medicine
   -- Hold off on morphine as unclear if pt really in pain
   -- Continue to hold lidocaine
   -- Monitor mental status
   # STEMI: Had inferior resolving STEMI by the time he presented to
   [**Hospital1 19**].  He has been managed medically due to inability to consent to
   catheterization and length of time between MI and presentation for
   cath.
   -- hold aspirin, plavix, given bleeding --> will likely restart ASA
   81mg PO daily 1 week after resolution (would restart [**2165-3-24**])
   -- continue atorvastatin
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Supratheraputic INR 5.2 --> 3.2
 1.3 after vitamin K
   10 mg and FFP x 4.  Platelets are also reduced at 67 (and have been as
   low as 42). also has antibodies to blood products and requires special
   ""rare"" blood
   -- trend INR
   -- continue to hold warfarin, plavix, and aspirin, pt probably failed
   warfarin and plavix for life, may restart baby aspirin 1 week after
   resolution
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved after transfusion. Most likely medication
   induced from combination of valproate (chronically lives in 50s-100s)
   and now with pantoprazole infusion possibly contributing.
   -- Change pantoprazole to IV BID
   -- Monitor
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Most likely ascites given dullness to
   percussion versus gas from EGD vs constipation. No significant TTP,
   bowel sounds improving, perforated gastric ulcer unlikely given no sign
   of ulcer on EGD.
   -- Serial abdominal exams (have been remaining stable)
   -- Request renal U/S to look for ascites
   -- Low threshold to obtain CT abdomen without contrast
   # Fever: Resolved. Likely from aspiration PNA.
   -- Vanc/zosyn now, Day 1 = [**2165-3-17**], day [**4-6**]
   -- Plan per above whether one of the abx is causing the renal failure
   may need to alter regimen
   -- Obtain sputum
   -- blood culture
   -- urine culture-- continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   #  Diabetes:
   -- fingersticks QID
   -- insulin SS at full dose
   -- lantus at full dose
   -- hold glyburide
   .
   #  Seizure disorder:
   -- continue Levetiracetam 500 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- consider stopping Divalproex ER 1000 mg qhs if thrombocytopenia
   continues to worsen <50
   .
   # atrial fibrilation:
   -- hold digoxin
   -- Metoprolol and dilt gtt per above
   -- holding warfarin given supratheraputic, pt probably failed warfarin
   for life

   # Hypertension:
   -- will monitor
   -- hold metoprolol as above

   but she says that she never agreed or signed anything saying that she
   would be his HCP. She is not his daughter as recorded by the [**Name (NI) 333**], is not
   related to his family at all. Does not have any children, spouse, or
   next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] that he is in contact with. [**Name2 (NI) **] has two estranged brothers,
   but [**Name (NI) 987**] and his [**Name (NI) 333**] does not know their names or any contact

   from heroic life prolonging measures such as CPR that the pt likely

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia.
- He presented with an inferior STEMI that was managed medically.
- The patient developed melena, a drop in hemoglobin concentration, and positive nasogastric lavage indicating an upper gastrointestinal bleed.
- He is now oliguric and has renal failure, possibly secondary to hypoperfusion or medication toxicity.
- The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, and his current condition includes pneumonia, ventricular tachycardia, acute on chronic heart failure, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, and abdominal distension.
- He is on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and others.
- The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status.
- He is currently receiving full liquids by mouth and is being monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient is oliguric, indicating decreased urine output, and has a history of hypoperfusion. This may be due to severe gastrointestinal bleed or medication toxicity, such as vancomycin or piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has melena and positive nasogastric"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 14636**] is a 67 YOM with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM, Afib, and
   schizophrenia who presented with inferior STEMI managed medically, who
   developed melena, Hct drop, and positive NG lavage consistent with
   upper GIB.
   .
   # ARF: Now oliguric. Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion in setting
   of severe GI bleed, however, unclear why continuing to worsen. Ddx
   includes vancomycin toxicity given supratherapeutic levels, vs zosyn
   toxicity.
   -- Renal consult
   -- Reanalyze urine sediment with renal
   -- Renal U/S
   -- Adjust vanc and zosyn dosing
   -- Discuss with renal if either abx is a possible culprit then will
   have to readjust HAP dosing
   -- Change to renal diet
   -- Renally dose remainder of medications
   # GIB: Likely upper bleed given melena, nausea, and + NG lavage.  Pt
   complaining of abdominal pain and still having melanotic stools. EGD
   confirms severe hemorrhagic gastritis and in setting of
   supratherapeutic INR most likely source of bleed. No longer having
   melena. H Pylori negative.
   -- continue pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   -- INR corrected
   -- transfuse only if HCT unstable to goal >30 if possible
   -- Hct check [**Hospital1 7**] given trend downward
   -- maintain IV access with 2 large bore IVs plus 20 gauge and PICC
   -- Consider IV fluids if needed for blood pressure (although currently
   hemodynamically stable)
   -- Can cautiously advance to regular cardiac, renal, and diabetic diet
   with carafate slurry
   .
   # Tachycardia: Most likely atrial tachycardia with variable conduction.
   Dehydration, hypoxia, or fever unlikely triggers. Trigger was most
   likely adrenergic surge in setting of agitation. Ddx includes a
   flutter.
   -- Continue dilt 90mg PO QID for now
   -- Treat underlying agitation as before
   -- Continue metoprolol 50mg PO Q8H
   -- No need for cardioversion now
   -- Monitor telemetry
   # Acute on chronic heart failure: Most likely secondary to blood and
   fluid given in setting of GI bleed with likely RV failure from probable
   inferior MI.
   -- Recommend lasix 60mg IV ONCE and titrate to goal negative 1L
   -- PM Lytes
   -- Monitor Is/Os
   -- Low sodium diet
   -- Continue rate control
   -- Recommend renal U/S to look for ascites
   # Vtach: developed in setting of hypovolemia from acute blood loss.
   Likely ischemic or periinfarction ischemia leading to irritable
   ventricular focus. No more sustained V tach for 48 hours.  Resolved.
   # Altered mental status: Patient with baseline yelling and confusion,
   unclear whether on appropriate regimen for presumed diagnosis of
   schizophrenia as pt not on any antipsychotics. Ie, trazadone seems a
   strange medicine for presumed schizophrenia.
   --  Psychiatry regimen to optimize his medicine
   -- Hold off on morphine as unclear if pt really in pain
   -- Continue to hold lidocaine
   -- Monitor mental status
   # STEMI: Had inferior resolving STEMI by the time he presented to
   [**Hospital1 19**].  He has been managed medically due to inability to consent to
   catheterization and length of time between MI and presentation for
   cath.
   -- hold aspirin, plavix, given bleeding --> will likely restart ASA
   81mg PO daily 1 week after resolution (would restart [**2165-3-24**])
   -- continue atorvastatin
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Supratheraputic INR 5.2 --> 3.2
 1.3 after vitamin K
   10 mg and FFP x 4.  Platelets are also reduced at 67 (and have been as
   low as 42). also has antibodies to blood products and requires special
   ""rare"" blood
   -- trend INR
   -- continue to hold warfarin, plavix, and aspirin, pt probably failed
   warfarin and plavix for life, may restart baby aspirin 1 week after
   resolution
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved after transfusion. Most likely medication
   induced from combination of valproate (chronically lives in 50s-100s)
   and now with pantoprazole infusion possibly contributing.
   -- Change pantoprazole to IV BID
   -- Monitor
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Most likely ascites given dullness to
   percussion versus gas from EGD vs constipation. No significant TTP,
   bowel sounds improving, perforated gastric ulcer unlikely given no sign
   of ulcer on EGD.
   -- Serial abdominal exams (have been remaining stable)
   -- Request renal U/S to look for ascites
   -- Low threshold to obtain CT abdomen without contrast
   # Fever: Resolved. Likely from aspiration PNA.
   -- Vanc/zosyn now, Day 1 = [**2165-3-17**], day [**4-6**]
   -- Plan per above whether one of the abx is causing the renal failure
   may need to alter regimen
   -- Obtain sputum
   -- blood culture
   -- urine culture-- continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   #  Diabetes:
   -- fingersticks QID
   -- insulin SS at full dose
   -- lantus at full dose
   -- hold glyburide
   .
   #  Seizure disorder:
   -- continue Levetiracetam 500 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- consider stopping Divalproex ER 1000 mg qhs if thrombocytopenia
   continues to worsen <50
   .
   # atrial fibrilation:
   -- hold digoxin
   -- Metoprolol and dilt gtt per above

   schizophrenia as pt not on any antipsychotics. Ie, trazadone seems a
   strange medicine for presumed schizophrenia.
   --  Psychiatry regimen to optimize his medicine
   -- Hold off on morphine as unclear if pt really in pain
   -- Continue to hold lidocaine
   -- Monitor mental status
   # STEMI: Had inferior resolving STEMI by the time he presented to
   [**Hospital1 19**].  He has been managed medically due to inability to consent to
   catheterization and length of time between MI and presentation for
   cath.
   -- hold aspirin, plavix, given bleeding --> will likely restart ASA
   81mg PO daily 1 week after resolution (would restart [**2165-3-24**])
   -- continue atorvastatin
   .
   #  Coagulopathy:  Supratheraputic INR 5.2 --> 3.2
 1.3 after vitamin K
   10 mg and FFP x 4.  Platelets are also reduced at 67 (and have been as
   low as 42). also has antibodies to blood products and requires special
   ""rare"" blood
   -- trend INR
   -- continue to hold warfarin, plavix, and aspirin, pt probably failed
   warfarin and plavix for life, may restart baby aspirin 1 week after
   resolution
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved after transfusion. Most likely medication
   induced from combination of valproate (chronically lives in 50s-100s)
   and now with pantoprazole infusion possibly contributing.
   -- Change pantoprazole to IV BID
   -- Monitor
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Most likely ascites given dullness to
   percussion versus gas from EGD vs constipation. No significant TTP,
   bowel sounds improving, perforated gastric ulcer unlikely given no sign
   of ulcer on EGD.
   -- Serial abdominal exams (have been remaining stable)
   -- Request renal U/S to look for ascites
   -- Low threshold to obtain CT abdomen without contrast
   # Fever: Resolved. Likely from aspiration PNA.
   -- Vanc/zosyn now, Day 1 = [**2165-3-17**], day [**4-6**]
   -- Plan per above whether one of the abx is causing the renal failure
   may need to alter regimen
   -- Obtain sputum
   -- blood culture
   -- urine culture-- continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   #  Diabetes:
   -- fingersticks QID
   -- insulin SS at full dose
   -- lantus at full dose
   -- hold glyburide
   .
   #  Seizure disorder:
   -- continue Levetiracetam 500 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- consider stopping Divalproex ER 1000 mg qhs if thrombocytopenia
   continues to worsen <50
   .
   # atrial fibrilation:
   -- hold digoxin
   -- Metoprolol and dilt gtt per above
   -- holding warfarin given supratheraputic, pt probably failed warfarin
   for life
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -- will monitor
   -- hold metoprolol as above
   .
   # Schizophrenia:
   -- pt is not consentable

   # Social issues - HCP on record at his nursing home is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 987**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2372**],
   but she says that she never agreed or signed anything saying that she
   would be his HCP. She is not his daughter as recorded by the [**Name (NI) 333**], is not
   related to his family at all. Does not have any children, spouse, or
   next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] that he is in contact with. [**Name2 (NI) **] has two estranged brothers,
   but [**Name (NI) 987**] and his [**Name (NI) 333**] does not know their names or any contact
   information. [**Name2 (NI) **] at this point is not consentable. He made his
   DNR/DNI decision 2 years ago when he was still deemed competent to make
   decisions per his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 3062**]. Legal was consulted and states that
   interventions that are ""reasonable"" can be done, which is different
   from heroic life prolonging measures such as CPR that the pt likely
   would not want.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia. He presented with inferior STEMI managed medically and developed melena, Hct drop, and positive NG lavage consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleed (GIB).

The patient's current medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is now oliguric, likely secondary to hypoperfusion in the setting of severe GI bleed. The differential diagnosis includes vancomycin toxicity given supratherapeutic levels versus zosyn toxicity. Renal consult, reanalysis of urine sediment, renal ultrasound (U/S), adjustment of vanc and zosyn dosing, discussion with renal team regarding possible culprit antibiotics, and changing to renal diet are recommended.

2. Gastrointestinal bleed (GIB): The patient likely has an upper bleed given melena, nausea, and positive NG lavage. EGD confirmed severe hemorrhagic gastritis. Supratherapeutic INR is a likely source of bleed. Pantoprazole 40mg IV BID should be continued, INR should be corrected, and transfusion should only be given if Hct is unstable to goal >30 if possible.

3. Tachycardia: The patient likely has atrial tachycardia with"
