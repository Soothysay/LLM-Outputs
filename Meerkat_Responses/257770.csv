   Assessment and Plan
 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o man with a significant cardiac history of
   rheumatic fever, AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE
   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold on cardiac cath this AM given resolution of chest pain and
   supratherapeutic INR
   - Increased aspirin from 81mg to 325mg PO Daily
   - Increased atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg PO Daily
   - Wean nitro gtt, write for nitro PRN
   - Morphine 2-6mg IV Q4H PRN pain
   - Supplemental O2 to reduce myocardial demand
   - Hold metoprolol given worsening PR delay
   - Hold on heparin as pt with supratherapeutic INR and unlikely to help
   in thromboembolic mechanism
   - Hold on plavix for same as above plus surgery has not been ruled out
   - Trend enzymes Q8H until peak confirmed
   .
   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with 1 major and 3 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic with INR.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Consider repeat TEE given worsening PR delay
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and help confirm the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.
   # Coagulopathy: Supratherapeutic secondary most likely to antibiotics.
   - Hold warfarin for now
   - No role for reversal as pt at high risk for thrombotic complication
   with mechanical valve
   .
   # Aminitis: Most likely secondary to zosyn as was started on [**2151-5-4**]
   and stopped on transfer on [**2151-5-6**] and has been trending down since.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to statin, however pt had been on statin in [**2147**] and
   had normal LFTs so less likely. Thromboembolic disease to liver is also
   possible, less likely given lack of CT abnormalities. Viral hepatitis
   possible
   - Monitor
   - Add on viral serologies
   - If continues to worsen, obtain RUQ U/S
   .
   # Normocytic anemia: Unclear etiology, baseline in high 20s low 30s.
   - Check iron studies, B12, folate
   - Guiac all stools
   - Schedule outpatient colonoscopy if not already completed
   .
   # HLD:
   - atorva 80 per above
   .
   # FEN: NPO for possible repeat TEE today, replete lytes prn

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a significant cardiac history of rheumatic fever, aortic valve replacement (AVR), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2. He was transferred to the ICU for suspected infective endocarditis and gram-positive bacteremia. The patient developed substernal chest pain concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and his EKG changes and troponin elevation confirmed the diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient has several potential medical complications based on the information provided:

1. Infective Endocarditis: The patient meets major and minor criteria for infective endocarditis. He has a mechanical valve, evidence of embolic disease with a splenic infarct, and blood culture data. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but he has already been started on penicillin and gentamicin therapy.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient experienced substernal chest pain and has EKG changes and elevated troponin levels, indicating NSTEMI. His chest pain resolved, but there is a suspicion of a thromboembolic coronary occlusion leading to NSTEMI. Further evaluation by surgery may be necessary.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR secondary to antibiotics. Warfarin is being held, and the goal INR is 2.5-3.5 for the mechanical valve and atrial"

   Assessment and Plan
 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o man with a significant cardiac history of
   rheumatic fever, AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE
   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - NPO after MN for probable cardiac catheterization tomorrow AM,
   especially if still with CP and/or EKG changes
   - Increase aspirin from 81mg to 325mg PO Daily
   - Increase atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg PO Daily
   - Continue nitro gtt to titrate until CP free
   - Morphine 2-6mg IV Q4H PRN pain
   - Supplemental O2 to reduce myocardial demand
   - Rate control with metoprolol 25mg PO TID to reduce myocardial demand
   - Hold on heparin as pt with supratherapeutic INR and unlikely to help
   in thromboembolic mechanism
   - Hold on plavix for same as above plus surgery has not been ruled out
   - Trend enzymes Q8H until peak confirmed
   .
   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with technically 4 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - PICC line placement once afebrile
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and clinch the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.
   .
   # Aminitis: Most likely secondary to zosyn as was started on [**2151-5-4**]
   and stopped on transfer on [**2151-5-6**] and has been trending down since.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to statin, however pt had been on statin in [**2147**] and
   had normal LFTs so less likely. Thromboembolic disease to liver is also
   possible, less likely given lack of CT abnormalities. Viral hepatitis
   possible
   - Monitor
   - Consider viral serologies
   - If continues to worsen, obtain RUQ U/S
   .
   # Normocytic anemia: Unclear etiology, baseline in high 20s low 30s.
   - Check iron studies, B12, folate
   - Guiac all stools
   - Schedule outpatient colonoscopy if not already completed
   .
   # HLD:
   - atorva 80 per above
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet (NPO after MN for possible cath), replete lytes prn

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man with a significant cardiac history who has been admitted to the ICU for gram-positive bacteremia and suspicion of endocarditis. The patient has developed substernal chest pain, which is concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 

The patient's medical history includes rheumatic fever, aortic valve replacement (AVR), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice, and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 5649] (St. [Male First Name (un) 4721] 21 mm mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [2147]. 

The patient is currently experiencing symptoms consistent with unstable angina, with EKG changes and a new troponin elevation of 0.37, confirming the diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The cause of the myocardial damage is suspected to be a thromboembolic event rather than plaque rupture, considering the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high suspicion for endocarditis.

The patient's current medications include nitroglycerin, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, aspirin, atorvastatin, and penicillin. The patient's blood cultures have been pending for several days, and there is a concern for infective endocarditis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
- Heart rate: 83 bpm (64-85 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 139/83 mmHg (93/66-143/93 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (20-23 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on nasal cannula

The patient's lab results show the following abnormalities:
- White blood cell count: 19.6 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 27.8%
- Platelet count: 435 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 0.34, 0.54
- Blood glucose: 173 mg/dL
- Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and neurologic examination is incomplete.

The patient's plan includes NPO after morning (MN) for probable cardiac catheterization tomorrow AM, especially if still with chest pain and/or EKG changes. The patient's aspirin dosage has been increased from 81 mg to 325 mg PO daily, and atorvastatin dosage has been increased from 40 mg to 80 mg PO daily. Nitroglycerin will be continued to titrate until chest pain-free. Morphine will be administered intraven"

   Assessment and Plan
 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o man with a significant cardiac history of
   rheumatic fever, AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE
   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - NPO after MN for probable cardiac catheterization tomorrow AM,
   especially if still with CP and/or EKG changes
   - Increase aspirin from 81mg to 325mg PO Daily
   - Increase atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg PO Daily
   - Continue nitro gtt to titrate until CP free
   - Morphine 2-6mg IV Q4H PRN pain
   - Supplemental O2 to reduce myocardial demand
   - Rate control with metoprolol 25mg PO TID to reduce myocardial demand
   - Hold on heparin as pt with supratherapeutic INR and unlikely to help
   in thromboembolic mechanism
   - Hold on plavix for same as above plus surgery has not been ruled out
   - Trend enzymes Q8H until peak confirmed
   .
   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with technically 4 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - PICC line placement once afebrile
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and clinch the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.
   .
   # Aminitis: Most likely secondary to zosyn as was started on [**2151-5-4**]
   and stopped on transfer on [**2151-5-6**] and has been trending down since.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to statin, however pt had been on statin in [**2147**] and
   had normal LFTs so less likely. Thromboembolic disease to liver is also
   possible, less likely given lack of CT abnormalities. Viral hepatitis
   possible
   - Monitor
   - Consider viral serologies
   - If continues to worsen, obtain RUQ U/S
   .
   # Normocytic anemia: Unclear etiology, baseline in high 20s low 30s.
   - Check iron studies, B12, folate
   - Guiac all stools
   - Schedule outpatient colonoscopy if not already completed
   .
   # HLD:
   - atorva 80 per above
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet (NPO after MN for possible cath), replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of rheumatic fever, aortic valve replacement (AVR), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who presented with gram-positive bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis. He has developed substernal chest pain consistent with unstable angina, and his EKG changes and elevated troponin levels confirm the diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The possible cause of the myocardial damage is either plaque rupture or a thromboembolic event.

The patient is currently in the coronary care unit (CCU) and is being treated with nitroglycerin, metoprolol, and morphine for pain relief. His blood pressure is being monitored, and supplemental oxygen is being provided to reduce myocardial demand. The patient's coagulation status is being closely monitored due to a supratherapeutic INR, and heparin and clopidogrel have been held.

The patient is also suspected of having infective endocarditis, particularly involving his mechanical valve. This suspicion is based on his clinical presentation, blood culture data, and a recent unexplained splenic infarction. Alternative diagnoses include splenic infarct from an embolic event, but this does not explain the blood cultures and the patient's therapeutic INR.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with beta-blockers, and Coumadin has been temporarily"
