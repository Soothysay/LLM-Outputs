   keep on vanc and zosyn until cultures neg x 48 hrs; considering
   switching zosyn due to new eosinophilia (documented allergy to
   Augmentin).  Hypotension may be due to medications.  Pt took her
   antihypertensives 6 hours earlier than usual and in the setting of
   relatively new sildenafil, may have caused the hypotension.  CEs neg.
   Will f/u ECHO results today.  Finally given new eosinophilia,
   hyperkalemia (though in setting of missing HD) will perform [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   though unlikely to be adrenally insufficient.  Will cont. to hold
   antihypertensives and add back carefully.  Will hold sildenafil for

   50 F  with  HTN, ESRD on HD, sarcoidosis, pulmonary HTN, admit to MICU
   with hypotension which resolved, now returning to MICU with dyspnea and
   concern for hypoxia at hemodialysis.
   1.       Hypoxia/dyspnea.  Dyspnea lasting seconds with concern for
   decreased O2 sats at HD.  Concern that monitor not adequately picking
   up sats, as did not show reliable readings and ABG PaO2 98; however,
   this still represents a very high AA gradient.  Patient with DOE and on
   [**3-30**] L NC at baseline with ILD (likely sarcoid related) and pulmonary
   hypertension.  s/p 2L UF but still with basilar crackles.  No CP.
   Differential includes bronchospasm, euvolemic/flash pulmonary edema,
   PE, ACS (last less likely with no CP), PTX given line placement 2 days
   ago.
               - Bring BP and HR down to hopefully improve diastolic
   dysfunction and forward flow
 resume home losartan and give small dose
   beta blocker.  Start low given very recent hypotension.
               - Likely further HD with UF tomorrow.
               - PE less likely with no CP; however, will keep in
   differential and CTA if continues to have low sats despite improvements
   in BP and volume status.  Consideration for anticoagulation in the long
   term given pulm HTN.
               - Check enzymes.
               - Check CXR for rule of PTX and eval of volume status/pulm
   edema
               - Would favor resumption of revatio this evening or in AM.
   2.       Hypotension:  Requiring levophed overnight, concerning for
   sepsis with initiation of broad spectrum abx.  Now hypertensive.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - restart home antiHTNs tonight at lower doses (start losartan 50 mg
   [**Hospital1 **])
   - cover health-care associated infections with Vanc and cipro until
   culture negative x 48
   3.       ESRD on HD:  s/p HD today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary hypertension, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and epilepsy. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and tachypnea and returned to the MICU today due to dyspnea and concern for hypoxia during hemodialysis.

The patient's recent history includes being admitted yesterday with hypotension, developing dyspnea on the way to dialysis, and being found to have a blood pressure of 85. She was on levophed in the emergency department and MICU, which was soon weaned off. She received vancomycin and zosyn for concern of sepsis, but the eosinophil count increased with zosyn, so it was changed to ciprofloxacin.

Upon arrival at dialysis, the patient's oxygen saturation was 96% on 30 liters per minute. She had an uneventful dialysis session with removal of 2 liters of ultrafiltrate. After being taken off dialysis, the patient complained of needing more oxygen. Her oxygen saturation was reportedly in the 60s on 4 liters of nasal cannula, so she was placed on a non-rebreather mask. Upon the arrival of the MICU team, the patient was on the non-rebreather mask"

   50 F  with  HTN, ESRD on HD, sarcoidosis, pulmonary HTN, admit to MICU
   with hypotension which resolved, now returning to MICU with dyspnea and
   concern for hypoxia at hemodialysis.
   # Hypoxia / dyspnea:
   Dyspnea lasting seconds with concern for decreased O2 sats at HD.
   Concern that monitor not adequately picking up sats, as did not show
   reliable readings and ABG PaO2 98; however, this still represents a
   very high AA gradient.  Patient with DOE and on [**3-30**] L NC at baseline
   with ILD (likely sarcoid related) and pulmonary hypertension.  s/p 2L
   UF but still with basilar crackles (though difficult to differentiate
   from ILD crackles).  No CP.  Differential includes bronchospasm,
   euvolemic/flash pulmonary edema, PE, ACS (last less likely with no CP),
   PTX given line placement 2 days ago.
   - Bring BP down to hopefully improve diastolic dysfunction and forward
   flow
 resume home losartan.  Start low given very recent hypotension.
   - Likely further HD with UF tomorrow.
   - PE less likely with no CP; however, will keep in differential and CTA
   if continues to have low sats despite improvements in BP and volume
   status.  Consideration for anticoagulation in the long term given pulm
   HTN.
   - Consider cardiac enzyme check .
   - Check CXR for rule of PTX and eval of volume status/pulm [**Last Name (un) 468**]
   - Would favor resumption of revatio this evening or in AM.
   # Hypotension:
   Requiring levophed overnight, concerning for sepsis with initiation of
   broad spectrum abx.  Now hypertensive.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - restart home antiHTNs tonight at lower doses (start losartan 50 mg
   [**Hospital1 **])
   - cover health-care associated infections with Vanc and cipro until
   culture negative x 48
   # ESRD on HD:  s/p HD today.
   - HD again tomorrow (will d/w renal)
   - cont. Renagel
   # Pulmonary HTN:
   - Sildenifil as above.
   # HIT
   - will avoid heparin products

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), sarcoidosis, and pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). The patient was admitted to the MICU with hypotension, which has since resolved. She is now experiencing dyspnea and concern for hypoxia at hemodialysis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F (39.4°C), heart rate of 78 bpm (normal range 75-99 bpm), blood pressure of 130/56 mmHg (previously hypertensive), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (normal range 18-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on 5L nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include a supple neck, no jugular venous distention (JAD), normal heart sounds with a loud P2 component, II/VI systolic murmur, diffuse fine crackles across posterior lung fields, left hemodialysis line non-tender at insertion, and a palpable thrill at the arteriovenous fistula.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 17.2 K/uL (normal range 4.5-11.0 K/uL), elevated hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL (normal range 12.0"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD), sarcoidosis, and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU due to hypotension, which has since resolved. She is currently being treated for hypoxia and dyspnea, fever, hypertension, ESRD on HD, pulmonary hypertension, and a possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She has been experiencing tachypnea and hypoxia during dialysis, with an abnormal arterial blood gas (ABG) result. She also spiked a fever of 102.9 and received blood cultures from both peripheral veins and central venous catheter (CVC). Her vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F, blood pressure of 130/56 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 5L nasal cannula. The patient reports no dyspnea greater than her baseline, but denies chest pain, nausea, or vomiting. Physical examination reveals diffuse fine crackles across posterior lung fields and a palpable thrill at the arteriovenous fistula site. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, and troponin T levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring for potential complications such as hypoxia, fever, hypertension, flash pulmonary edema, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypotension, which has since resolved. The patient presented with dyspnea and concern for hypoxia at hemodialysis, leading to her readmission to the MICU. She denies cough or sputum production and has no evidence of acute changes on chest X-ray. Her troponin levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea: The patient's sudden onset of dyspnea and concern for hypoxia during hemodialysis suggests a possible complication related to the dialysis process or an underlying respiratory condition.
2. Fever: The patient had a high fever of 102.9 degrees yesterday, which could indicate an infection. Blood cultures were obtained, and the stool test for Clostridium difficile was negative.
3. Hypertension: The patient originally presented with hypotension but became hypertensive following dialysis yesterday. This may be due to volume shifts during dialysis or other factors.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis: The patient requires ongoing hemodialysis due to her end-stage renal disease. Monitoring for any complications related to the dialysis procedure is essential.
5. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the MICU with a chief complaint of tachypnea and hypoxia during dialysis. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, augmentin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and pruritus. He was previously on piperacillin/tazobactam but received his last dose at 04:05 AM on 04/29. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit and a heart rate of 78 bpm. His blood pressure is within normal range, with a reading of 130/56 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a sinus rhythm and normal fluid balance. However, there is a significant amount of fluid being output through various drains, resulting in a negative fluid balance.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. The platelet count is slightly below normal, while other electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus are within normal range. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal limits, but there is an elevation in lactate acid, LDH, and CK-MB. The assessment and plan include hypoxemia, sepsis without organ"

   Assessment and Plan
   0 F  with  HTN, ESRD on HD, sarcoidosis, pulmonary HTN, admit to MICU
   with hypotension which resolved, now returning to MICU with dyspnea and
   concern for hypoxia at hemodialysis.
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea.
   Dyspnea lasting seconds with concern for decreased O2 sats at HD.
   Concern that monitor not adequately picking up sats, as did not show
   reliable readings and ABG PaO2 98; however, this still represents a
   very high AA gradient.  Patient with DOE and on [**3-30**] L NC at baseline
   with ILD (likely sarcoid related) and pulmonary hypertension.  s/p 2L
   UF but still with basilar crackles (though difficult to differentiate
   from ILD crackles).  No CP.  Differential includes bronchospasm,
   euvolemic/flash pulmonary edema, PE, ACS (last less likely with no CP),
   PTX given line placement 2 days ago.
   - Bring BP down to hopefully improve diastolic dysfunction and forward
   flow
 resume home losartan.  Start low given very recent hypotension.
   - Likely further HD with UF tomorrow.
   - PE less likely with no CP; however, will keep in differential and CTA
   if continues to have low sats despite improvements in BP and volume
   status.  Consideration for anticoagulation in the long term given pulm
   HTN.
   - Consider cardiac enzyme check .
   - Check CXR for rule of PTX and eval of volume status/pulm [**Last Name (un) 468**]
   - Would favor resumption of revatio this evening or in AM.
   # Hypotension:
   Requiring levophed overnight, concerning for sepsis with initiation of
   broad spectrum abx.  Now hypertensive.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - restart home antiHTNs tonight at lower doses (start losartan 50 mg
   [**Hospital1 **])
   - cover health-care associated infections with Vanc and cipro until
   culture negative x 48
   # ESRD on HD:  s/p HD today.
   - HD again tomorrow (will d/w renal)
   - cont. Renagel
   # Pulmonary HTN:
   - Sildenifil as above.
   # HIT
   - will avoid heparin products
   # Epilepsy:  Last seizure was 2 years ago.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary hypertension, and previous admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension. The patient presented with dyspnea and hypoxia during hemodialysis, which resolved after being transferred back to the MICU. The patient also had a fever of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit and received blood cultures from both the peripheral vein and central venous catheter (CVC), although the CVC had not been discontinued prior to the call-out.

The patient's allergies include heparin agents, augmentin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and pruritus. The last dose of antibiotics given was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 04:05 AM of an unspecified date. The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications and other medications.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit, current temperature of 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 78 beats per minute (sinus rhythm), blood pressure ranging from 130/56 to 182/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.
