 [**2165-4-8**]
 Preliminary evaluation
 RV dysfunction
   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   1. s/p Arrest
   Etiology of his arrest is unclear and will be very difficult to assess
   given that he was unmonitored at the time of the event. Differential
   diagnosis includes pulmonary embolus given intraventricular conduction
   delay in lead V1, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Preliminary evaluation of
   echo appears to demonstrate RV dysfunction which would also be
   consistent for pulmonary embolus. Additional differential diagnosis
   includes ischemia, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia, although
   patient has no prior history of any of these abnormalities. An
   additional possibility includes a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic
   instability resulting in a PEA arrest, although patient has no specific
   localizing symptoms or signs.
   - for evaluation of PE, will check CTA chest for evaluation of PE and
   coordinate CT head to evaluate for any intracranial bleed that would
   act as a contraindication to anticoagulation
   - follow-up fasting lipids in the AM
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable,
   although this seems less likely given that patient has minimmal other
   risk factors
   - follow-up echo read
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable if no additional cause of VF arrest is found
   - continue cooling protocol via Arctic Sun
   - follow-up EEG and neuro recs per cardiac arrest protocol
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to his Vfib arrest,
   although infection is also possible. Only localizing symptom at this
   time includes his UA that is suggestive of UTI, although no leuks or
   nitrates despite > 50 WBCs and bacteria.
   - resend UA and culture, treat with cipro if positive
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure pending
   resolution of acute medical concerns
   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 399**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). CCU team.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Impression:  cardiopulmonary arrest in a 36-year old man with obesity
   and sleep apnea.  Diagnostic considerations are broad, but high on the
   list is pulmonary embolism and primary cardiac arrhythmia.  ACS is less
   likely given ECG, but is possible. Primary respiratory arrest is also a
   consideration.  Finally, this could have been a primary neurologic
   event given ?seizure, though the latter could have just been secondary
   to hypoxemia.
   Plan:
   1. Cooling protocol in progress
   2. Will interrupt #1 briefly to obtain head CT scan (r/o CNS bleed,
   structural brain abnormality, etc.)
   3. CTA chest to r/o PE
   4. Will decide on IV heparin after #2 and #3
   5. Echocardiogram to assess RV function in the meantime
   6. Repeat U/A
   7. Continuous EEG to r/o status epilepticus

   Clinician:  Attending
   We attempted to perform head and chest CT scans today (see note above),
   but the patient is too large to fit on the scanner.  At this time, he
   is hemodynamically stable (mildly bradycardic [**2-11**] cooling), but his A-a
   gradient is very large and he is not ventilating well.
   At this time, I think that PE is much higher on the differential of his
   arrest than any structural brain abnormality.  I believe that he would
   be best served with IV infusion of heparin to treat presumed PE.  There
   is a small chance of intracranial hemorrhage with IV heparin if he has
   an underlying structural abnormality, but I don't think that's likely.
   I spoke to his [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Name (NI) 6659**] (?sp), who is his HCP and made her aware
   of the situation and the risks.  She agreed that we should go forward
   with blood thinners ""based on what we believe is going on"".  She is
   aware of the potential risks.
   Total time spent:  60 minutes
   Patient is critically ill.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The etiology of the arrest is unclear and will be difficult to assess given that he was unmonitored at the time. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 151/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and temperature of 36.8Â°C.

Physical examination reveals an obese male with no acute distress, intubated and sedated. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics including ceftriaxone and vancomycin. He is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. Other medications include various ICU medications.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels at 2.14 ng/mL, and elevated creatinine levels at 1.1 mg/dL. The ECG demonstrates sinus tachycardia, normal axis, intraventricular conduction delay in lead V1, and no ST changes.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's arrest is of unclear etiology and will be challenging to assess due to the lack of monitoring. Differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolus, ischemia, structural"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old obese male who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The exact cause of the arrest is unclear, but possible causes include pulmonary embolism, ischemia, structural heart disease, arrhythmia, or a non-cardiac cause. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 90%. He is currently sedated and undergoing a cooling protocol for therapeutic hypothermia.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 151/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The echocardiogram preliminary evaluation indicates right ventricular dysfunction, which could be consistent with a pulmonary embolism.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.

Plan:
1. Continue cooling protocol.
2. Obtain head CT scan to rule out CNS bleed or structural brain abnormality.
3. Perform CTA chest to rule out pulmonary embolism.
4. Decide on IV heparin after completing steps 2 and 3.
5. Assess right ventricular function through echocardiogram.
6. Repeat urine analysis.

 Preliminary evaluation
 RV dysfunction
   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   1. s/p Arrest
   Etiology of his arrest is unclear and will be very difficult to assess
   given that he was unmonitored at the time of the event. Differential
   diagnosis includes pulmonary embolus given intraventricular conduction
   delay in lead V1, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Preliminary evaluation of
   echo appears to demonstrate RV dysfunction which would also be
   consistent for pulmonary embolus. Additional differential diagnosis
   includes ischemia, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia, although
   patient has no prior history of any of these abnormalities. An
   additional possibility includes a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic
   instability resulting in a PEA arrest, although patient has no specific
   localizing symptoms or signs.
   - for evaluation of PE, will check CTA chest for evaluation of PE and
   coordinate CT head to evaluate for any intracranial bleed that would
   act as a contraindication to anticoagulation
   - follow-up fasting lipids in the AM
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable,
   although this seems less likely given that patient has minimmal other
   risk factors
   - follow-up echo read
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable if no additional cause of VF arrest is found
   - continue cooling protocol via Arctic Sun
   - follow-up EEG and neuro recs per cardiac arrest protocol
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to his Vfib arrest,
   although infection is also possible. Only localizing symptom at this
   time includes his UA that is suggestive of UTI, although no leuks or
   nitrates despite > 50 WBCs and bacteria.
   - resend UA and culture, treat with cipro if positive
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure pending
   resolution of acute medical concerns
   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity admitted to the ICU after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest at home. The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but possible causes include pulmonary embolism, ischemia, structural heart disease, arrhythmia, or a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and an arterial line has been placed. He is currently receiving antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) and infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 151/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The patient's temperature is being actively cooled via the Arctic Sun protocol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's preliminary echo demonstrates RV dysfunction, which is consistent with a possible pulmonary embolism. Additional testing, such as a CT angiogram (CTA) chest, will be performed to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism. A CT head will also be coordinated to check for any intracranial bleed that would contraindicate anticoagulation.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.1 K/uL, which could be due"

   Imaging: ECHO:  The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
   depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen but is probably mildly dilated/hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male who was brought to the emergency department in cardiac arrest. After resuscitation, he was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemia. The patient has a history of obesity, and his body habitus is making it difficult to obtain clear imaging studies.

On initial assessment, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on multiple medications including heparin, vecuronium, and fentanyl.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating a possible infection. Blood cultures have been obtained. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, but liver function tests are slightly elevated. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

A 2D echocardiogram was performed, but the image quality was poor due to the patient's body habitus. The left ventricular ejection fraction is mildly reduced at 45-50%, and there is mild global hypokinesis of the right ventricle. There are no significant valvular abnormalities noted.

The patient's urinary output has been low, and he has developed a urinary tract infection, for which ciprofloxacin has been started. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, and he is being closely monitored"

   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   .
   1. s/p Arrest :  Unclear etiology.  Highest on the differential is PE
   given morbid obesity and sedentary lifestyle.  Additional differential
   diagnosis includes ischemia, which is not likely given no evidence on
   ECG, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no
   prior history of any of these abnormalities.  An additional possibility
   includes a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability resulting in a
   PEA arrest, although patient has no specific localizing symptoms or
   signs.  Given patient's multiple medical problems including sleep
   apnea, asthma, and morbid obesity, a possible etiology of his arrest
   was arrest in the setting of hypoxia related to his
   obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and asthma, however less likely.
   ECG showed evidence of RSR
 IVCD and RV hypokinesis on ECHO yesterday
   consistent with possible PE.  Attempted to get a CTA to look for PE
   yesterday, however based on pts weight it was unable to be completed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but potential causes include pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemia, structural heart disease, arrhythmia, or a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability. The patient has multiple medical problems including sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid obesity. An ECG showed evidence of right-sided heart strain, and an echocardiogram revealed right ventricular hypokinesis, suggesting a possible PE. 

The patient is currently undergoing cooling therapy as part of the Artic Sun Cooling protocol and will be rewarming at 1 pm. He is intubated and sedated, and plans are in place to replete electrolytes aggressively following rewarming. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered, and CK levels will be trended daily. Treatment with ciprofloxacin has been initiated for leukocytosis, which is likely secondary to the ventricular fibrillation arrest. 

The patient's morbid obesity is also being addressed, with ongoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery. Respiratory failure is managed through continued intubation and sedation for adequate cooling. Transaminitis has improved. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's morbid obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis on ECHO,"

The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but possible causes include hypoxia related to obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and asthma, as well as pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient has been intubated, sedated, and placed on cooling protocol with vecuronium due to ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) arrest.

   Imaging: ECHO:  The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
   depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen but is probably mildly dilated/hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined.
   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   .
   1. s/p Arrest :  Unclear etiology.  Highest on the differential is PE
   given morbid obesity and sedentary lifestyle.  Additional differential
   diagnosis includes ischemia, which is not likely given no evidence on
   ECG, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no
   prior history of any of these abnormalities.  An additional possibility
   includes a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability resulting in a
   PEA arrest, although patient has no specific localizing symptoms or
   signs.  Given patient's multiple medical problems including sleep
   apnea, asthma, and morbid obesity, a possible etiology of his arrest
   was arrest in the setting of hypoxia related to his
   obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and asthma, however less likely.
   ECG showed evidence of RSR
 IVCD and RV hypokinesis on ECHO yesterday
   consistent with possible PE.  Attempted to get a CTA to look for PE
   yesterday, however based on pts weight it was unable to be completed.
   - Artic Sun Cooling protocol with vecuronium, start rewarming today at
   1pm
   - Intubated, sedated
   - LENIs today
   - Treat with heparin empirically
   - replete electrolytes aggressively, checking electrolytes Q6H
   following rewarming
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - Trend CK daily
   .
   2. Leukocytosis:   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related
   to his Vfib arrest, although infection is also possible, given evidence
   of UTI on UA.  Trending down.
   - Treat with Cipro
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   .
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure
   .
   4. Respiratory Failure:  Patient was intubated in the setting of
   cardiac arrest ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.  No evidence of ARDS
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling
   .
   5. Transaminitis:  Improved
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Follow and replete electrolytes. NPO for now. No IVF at
   present.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The arrest occurred while he was in a hypoxic state, possibly due to sleep apnea, asthma, or obesity-related hypoventilation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis and right atrioventricular dissociation, suggesting a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). An echocardiogram revealed mild global right ventricular hypokinesis, mild dilation of the right ventricular cavity, and mild dilation of the ascending aorta. No significant valvular abnormalities were noted.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest of unclear etiology: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which could be attributed to various causes such as pulmonary embolism, ischemia, structural heart disease, or arrhythmia. Given his multiple medical problems, including sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid obesity, hypoxia-related arrest is a possibility.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The ECG findings of right ventricular hypokinesis and right atrioventricular dissociation raise suspicion for PE. However, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) could not be completed due to the patient's weight. Treatment with heparin has been initiated empirically.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may be related"

   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   .
   1. s/p Arrest
   Etiology of his arrest is unclear and will be very difficult to assess
   given that he was unmonitored at the time of the event. Given patient's
   multiple medical problems including sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid
   obesity, a likely etiology of his arrest is arrest in the setting of
   hypoxia related to his obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and
   asthma. Additional differential diagnosis includes ischemia, structural
   heart disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no prior history of
   any of these abnormalities. An additional possibility includes a
   non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability resulting in a PEA arrest,
   although patient has no specific localizing symptoms or signs.
   - ECG upon arrival to the floor
   - rule-out MI
   - check fasting lipids in the AM
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable
   - echo in the AM
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable and has completed the arctic sun protocol
   - continue cooling protocol via Arctic Sun
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   .
   2. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to his Vfib arrest,
   although infection is also possible. Only localizing symptom at this
   time includes his UA that is suggestive of UTI, although no leuks or
   nitrates despite > 50 WBCs and bacteria.
   - resend UA and culture, treat with cipro if positive
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read

   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure

   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but possible causes include hypoxia related to obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, asthma, ischemia, structural heart disease, arrhythmia, or a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability.

The patient has been intubated and is currently on room air. He has a history of asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has undergone several interventions including cooling, vecuronium drip, heparin infusion, EEG monitoring, and placement of a right internal jugular central venous line. He is also receiving medications such as midazolam, vecuronium, fentanyl, and ciprofloxacin.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L, and mildly decreased potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L. The ECG showed a mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function with a LVEF of 45-50%, mild global free wall hypokinesis in the right ventricle, and no significant valvular abnormalities. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmia: Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and the presence of structural heart disease, there is a risk of recurrent cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and current intubation status put him at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Infection: Leukocytosis and a positive urine analysis suggestive of a urinary tract infection indicate a potential infection. Additionally, the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increases the risk of antibiotic-associated complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of sedative medications may increase the risk of stress ulcers.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a morbidly obese male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient has been intubated, sedated, and paralyzed.

Upon reviewing the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is a concern regarding the blood pressure being on the lower side. The respiratory rate is set at 28 breaths per minute, with a fraction of oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at 100%, indicating sufficient oxygenation.

The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT) area, neck, or heart. The chest examination shows no chest wall deformities or respiratory distress. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there are no notable findings in the extremities or skin.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. Kidney function seems to be normal, as indicated by the creatinine (Cr) level. Blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and anticoagulants. The patient also has multiple lines and tubes inserted for monitoring and administration of fluids and medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   .
   1. s/p Arrest :  Unclear etiology.  Highest on the differential is PE
   given morbid obesity and sedentary lifestyle.  Additional differential
   diagnosis includes ischemia, which is not likely given no evidence on
   ECG, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no
   prior history of any of these abnormalities.  An additional possibility
   includes a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability resulting in a
   PEA arrest, although patient has no specific localizing symptoms or
   signs.  Given patient's multiple medical problems including sleep
   apnea, asthma, and morbid obesity, a possible etiology of his arrest
   was arrest in the setting of hypoxia related to his
   obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and asthma, however less likely.
   ECG showed evidence of RSR
 IVCD and RV hypokinesis on ECHO yesterday
   consistent with possible PE.  Attempted to get a CTA to look for PE

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The patient's medical history includes sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid obesity. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is currently undergoing cooling treatment for suspected PE (pulmonary embolism) and rewarming after being on hypothermia protocol.

The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate (89 bpm) and blood pressure (97/50 mmHg), but slightly elevated respiratory rate (28 breaths per minute). Oxygen saturation is maintained at 100% with the help of mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 11.3 thousand/mm^3) and elevated cardiac enzymes (CK / CKMB / Troponin-T). The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (0.9 mg/dL) and magnesium (1.7 mg/dL) levels.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals clear lung fields without any signs of pneumonia. An echocardiogram showed evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis, which is consistent with possible PE.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms, including sudden cardiac arrest, along with the findings on the echocardiogram, suggest a possible PE. This condition"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The exact cause of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but it is suspected to be related to a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been in the ICU since admission and has been sedated and intubated.

Overnight, the patient became increasingly acidemic and hypoxemic despite being weaned from vecuronium. The sedation was increased, PEEP was decreased, and FiO2 was increased to improve hypoxia. The patient's EEG showed diffuse slowing, indicating potential neurologic dysfunction. Lower extremity Doppler studies were negative.

The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin, due to a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). Blood cultures were also obtained.

Various lab tests were conducted, revealing leukocytosis, elevated troponin T levels, and elevated CK/CKMB levels, indicating possible myocardial injury. Other lab results showed normal electrolyte levels but abnormal liver function tests.

The patient underwent an Artic Sun cooling protocol and did not experience any arrhythmias or seizures during re-warming. Efforts will be made to wean sedation today and reassess respiratory mechanics.

The patient has morbid obesity and is currently being evaluated for gastric bypass surgery. The plan is to continue outpatient evaluation for the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The exact cause of the arrest is unclear, but pulmonary embolism (PE) is suspected due to limitations in imaging provided by the patient's body size.
- The patient has shown evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram, which is consistent with possible PE. He has been started on heparin as prophylaxis for PE.
- The patient's neurologic status is currently sedated, making it difficult to assess responsiveness. An EEG showed diffuse slowing, and an attempt will be made to wean sedation today.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is currently on assisted ventilation. Overnight hypoxia was a concern, so PEEP and FiO2 were increased. The patient appears fluid overloaded on chest X-ray, and Lasix will be given to address this. There will be an attempt to wean sedation today and reassess respiratory mechanics.
- The patient has bloody sputum, which could be due to ETT trauma or pulmonary infarction.
- Leukocytosis is present, most likely secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Cultures have been obtained, and treatment with ciprofloxacin has been initiated.
- The patient is undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery due to morbid obesity.
- Transaminitis has improved.
- ICU care includes nutrition"

   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest :  Exact cause not clear, mainly [**2-11**] limitations in
   imaging provided by body size.  Highest on the differential is PE.  ECG
   showed evidence of RSR
 IVCD and RV hypokinesis on ECHO yesterday
   consistent with possible PE. Lenis negative yesterday.
   - heparin ggt for question of PE
   - Will check Ddimer from admit labs to see if negative would be able to
   stop hep gtt
   - trend CK daily
   .
   # Neurologic status: EEG with diffuse slowing. Currently sedated and
   thus unable to asses responsiveness. Will attempt weaning sedation
   today.
   - Artic Sun Cooling protocol completed. No arrythmias/seizures noted
   with re-warming
   - wean sedation today as below
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Currently on AC. Overnight hypoxia was a
   concern. Increased PEEP and FiO2.
   - Appears fluid overloaded on CXR this am. Will give lasix.
   - Will attempt weaning from sedation today (wean fentanyl and midazolam
   then attempt propofol) and reassess RISBI.
   - Have anesthesia consult prior to extubation to discuss prasodex
   during extubation and to have them present to re-intubate if necessary
   .
   # Bloody sputum: Possibly from ETT trauma vs pulmonary infarction
   # Leukocytosis:   Most likely in the setting of UTI on UA.  Trending

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6668**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). CCU team.
   Total time spent on patient care: 80 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Doing better, opens eye to stimuli.
   Plan:
   1. Lighten sedation
   2. Anesthesia consultation for extubation - perhaps we could use
   short-acting GA agents
   3. Check D-dimer with initial labs, if (-), stop heparin, o/w continue
   IV UFH
   4. Family updated

","The patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest at home. The cause of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) is suspected due to evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram and an ECG showing right-sided heart strain. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, with diffuse slowing on EEG.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and fluid overload as evidenced by an increased chest X-ray. He is being treated with heparin for a suspected PE and lasix for fluid overload. Sedation is being weaned today, and the patient will be assessed for readiness to extubate.

Other issues include leukocytosis, possibly due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is being treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient also has a history of transaminitis, which has improved.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of cardiac arrest and findings on echocardiogram raise the possibility of a PE. Continuing heparin therapy is appropriate while awaiting further evaluation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off sedation and assessing readiness for extubation will be crucial in determining the outcome.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's chest X-ray indicates"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest is a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedated. His neurologic status is being monitored with an EEG, which shows diffuse slowing. There are concerns about his respiratory failure, as he has been hypoxic overnight. The patient appears to be fluid overloaded on chest X-ray, so Lasix will be given to address this. The patient's bloody sputum is most likely due to endotracheal tube trauma, and there is no fever to suggest infection. Leukocytosis is present, which may be related to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has morbid obesity and is undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery. The patient also has transaminitis, but it has improved. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - The patient's cardiac arrest at home, along with the positive D-dimer, suggests a high suspicion for PE. If left untreated, PE can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially fatal outcomes.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient's hypoxia and need for increased PEEP indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, leading to organ damage.
3. Fluid overload - The patient's fluid balance shows a significant positive balance,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest is a pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has been sedated with propofol and fentanyl, but his sedation has been weaned, and he is now responsive to commands. The patient remains hypoxic on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. His blood gases show a PaO2 of 72, and he has an increased D-dimer level of 1408 ng/mL.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 145/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg, and he has received a total of 2,275 mL of fluids since midnight. The patient has been on heparin therapy, and his PTT is therapeutic.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 35.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 204 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose of 102 mg/dL. Troponin-T is elevated at 2.14, indicative of myocardial injury. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Neurologic status: EEG shows diffuse slowing, but the patient's responsiveness improves with weaning of sedation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia is concerning, and increased PEEP and FiO2 have been implemented. The chest X-ray shows signs of fluid overload, and Lasix has been initiated to manage fluid balance.
3. Bloody sputum: The patient has experienced bloody sputum, likely due to endotracheal tube trauma and anticoagulation. Cultures have been pending, and no signs of infection are present.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be related to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin has been continued.
5. Morbid obesity: The patient has morbid obesity and is undergoing evaluation for gastric bypass surgery.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes have improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia and reliance on mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's increased sputum production and potential aspiration risk may lead to pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and increased D-dimer level raise concerns for DVT.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and recent blood product transfusions increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Neurologic complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and diffuse slowing on EEG suggest a risk of neurologic complications such as brain injury or seizures."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The exact cause of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but pulmonary embolism (PE) is considered as a possible cause. The patient has been sedated and intubated, and various interventions have been performed.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O. Oxygenation is being monitored, and ABG results show a PaO2 of 72 with a D-dimer positive result.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are within the range of 145/64-162/79 mmHg.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, which could indicate an infection.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated.
5. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has low magnesium levels (Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL) and low potassium levels (K+: 3.6 mEq/L).

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The exact cause of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) is suspected due to evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram and risk factors for PE.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has been sedated but was weaned off some sedation today.
- The patient's oxygenation has been a concern overnight, and the PEEP was increased to 10 cmH2O to improve oxygenation.
- The patient's D-dimer levels are positive, indicating a possible clotting event.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or possibly related to the recent cardiac arrest.
- The patient has dark brown sputum production, which could be from endotracheal tube trauma or a pulmonary infarction.
- The patient has transaminitis, which has improved.
- The patient has morbid obesity and is undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 69 to 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 88 to 162 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 0 to 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac arrest. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is sedated with propofol. The patient's oxygenation has improved with increased PEEP but failed to tolerate a decrease in PEEP, leading to hypoxia. Sputum production has increased, and cultures show oropharyngeal flora. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm and blood pressure of 145/64 mmHg. He is in sinus rhythm. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has a positive D-dimer. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. There are abnormalities in electrolytes, liver enzymes, cardiac markers, and kidney function tests. The patient's nutritional status is altered, and he is at risk for ineffective coping and obesity. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the increased sputum production and the presence of oropharyngeal flora in the cultures, there is a risk of developing VAP due to the prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The positive D-dimer suggests the possibility of DVT or PE, which are common complications in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest is a pulmonary embolism. The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His neurologic status shows diffuse slowing on EEG, but responsiveness improves with weaning of sedation. The patient has respiratory failure and is being weaned off ventilatory support. There are concerns about hypoxia and fluid overload, so diuretics will be continued. The patient also has bloody sputum, which is most likely due to endotracheal tube trauma and anticoagulation. Leukocytosis may be related to a urinary tract infection, and cultures are pending. The patient is undergoing evaluation for gastric bypass surgery due to morbid obesity. His transaminitis has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced episodes of hypoxia, indicating a potential respiratory compromise. This could be due to the underlying lung condition causing the pulmonary embolism or fluid overload.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating fluid overload. This could lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.
3. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis suggests a possible infection. In this case, it may be related to a urinary tract infection, but further evaluation is needed to confirm.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The cause of the cardiac arrest is suspected to be a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest.
- The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, neurologic status with EEG showing diffuse slowing but responsiveness when sedation is weaned, bloody sputum likely due to endotracheal tube trauma and anticoagulation, leukocytosis possibly related to urinary tract infection, and morbid obesity with planned gastric bypass procedure.
- The patient is receiving various treatments including heparin, diuresis, tube feeds, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP precautions.
- The patient's vital signs show stable hemodynamics with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/62-182/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's lab results indicate normal WBC count, Hct, and platelet levels, but elevated troponin-T, CK, CKMB, and D-dimer levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.
- Imaging reveals signs of fluid overload, small left pleural effusion, and retrocardiac atelectasis.
- The plan is to continue weaning sedation and attempt to discontinue ventilation if"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The attending physician's progress note indicates several ongoing concerns and management plans for the patient.

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, most likely due to a pulmonary embolism (PE). Heparin has been initiated to prevent further clot formation.

2. Neurologic Status: The patient's neurologic status is currently sedated, making it difficult to assess responsiveness. An EEG shows diffuse slowing, indicating possible brain injury. The patient has undergone an Artic Sun Cooling protocol to prevent seizures, which was successful overnight.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on assisted ventilation with AC mode. Overnight hypoxia was a concern, so the PEEP and FiO2 have been increased. The patient's chest X-ray shows signs of fluid overload, and diuresis with Lasix has been initiated to manage this. The goal is to remove 2.5 liters of fluid overnight.

4. Weaning Attempt: The patient is responsive to commands but remains hypoxic. He is currently on pressure support (PS) settings of 10-16. Sedation will continue to be weaned, and if the patient remains more alert, the ventilator will be disconnected.

5. Bloody Sputum: The patient has bloody sputum, which may be due to endotracheal tube trauma and anticoagulation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. The patient has been receiving heparin for anticoagulation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on assisted ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST. There have been concerns about overnight hypoxia, so the PEEP and FiO2 have been increased. Weaning attempts have been made, but the patient remains hypoxic. The plan is to continue weaning sedation and attempt to discontinue ventilation if the patient remains more alert.

2. Bloody Sputum: The patient has been producing bloody sputum, which is likely due to ETT (endotracheal tube) trauma and the setting of anticoagulation. It is also possible that the sputum is contaminated. Cultures have been taken, and the patient will be monitored.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is most likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The white blood cell count has been trending down. The plan is to continue ciprofloxacin for a total of 10 days and obtain cultures from the nasogastric tube.

4. Morbid Obesity: The patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient evaluation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for overnight hypoxia, which has been addressed by increasing the PEEP and FiO2 levels. Continuous monitoring and weaning of sedation will be crucial in determining the next steps for discontinuing ventilatory support.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's chest X-ray showed signs of fluid overload, and he has been diuresed for two days with negative fluid balance. Close monitoring of fluid status and further diuresis may be necessary to prevent complications related to fluid overload.
3. Bloody Sputum: The patient has had bloody sputum, which is most likely due to ETT trauma and anticoagulation. Monitoring for any signs of infection and following up with cultures is important.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is most likely due to a urinary tract infection. Antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin will be continued for a total of 10 days, and cultures will be monitored.

","The patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male who was admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. The patient has been weaned off sedation and successfully extubated. He is currently on CPAP at night and NC or NRB during the daytime. 

The patient's blood pressure has been as high as 200 mmHg, so he has been started on nitroprusside to maintain a systolic blood pressure below 150 mmHg. Once the blood pressure is stable, the nitroprusside will be weaned off, and the patient will be placed on captopril and spironolactone.

Ciprofloxacin has been continued for a total of 10 days to treat a urinary tract infection, and cultures from the nasogastric tube are pending.

The patient is also undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery due to morbid obesity.

Overall, the patient's condition has improved since the extubation, and he is doing well in the ICU. The healthcare team reviewed the patient's assessment, management, and data, discussed feeding and blood pressure issues, and prescribed appropriate treatments. The patient spent 30 minutes with the physician, and no additional comments or concerns were noted."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU due to a cardiac arrest. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs have been monitored, showing fluctuations in blood pressure ranging from 190/100 to below 150 with the use of nitroprusside, and heart rate between 58-102 bpm. The patient's temperature has remained stable at 37.1Â°C (98.7Â°F). The patient's respiratory rate has been within normal limits, and oxygen saturation has been maintained at 100% with the use of CPAP and BiPAP. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,415 mL and an output of 2,880 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -465 mL. The patient's urine output has been good at 2,630 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160, suggesting adequate oxygenation and ventilation. 

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and D-dimer levels, as well as elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T), indicating potential myocardial injury. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest is a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. 

The patient's current health progress in the ICU includes being extubated and responsive to commands. However, there have been concerns about overnight hypoxia, so the patient has been placed on CPAP and then switched to BiPAP. 

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure ranging from 87/44 mmHg to 203/102 mmHg, heart rate between 58-102 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, as well as no chest wall deformities or signs of respiratory distress. The abdomen is described as soft and non-tender, with no evidence of peripheral edema. 

Laboratory results show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels. However, the cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) indicate a previous myocardial infarction, and the D-dimer level is elevated. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring for neurologic status, respiratory failure, bloody sputum, leukocytosis,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest.

The patient's current health progress includes:
1. Neurologic status: Improved after weaning sedation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated and is doing well on CPAP at night and NC or NRB during the day.
3. Hypertension: Blood pressure readings have been as high as 200 systolic. Nitroprusside infusion has been initiated to maintain SBP <150, and the plan is to wean off nitro and add captopril and spironolactone.
4. UTI: Ciprofloxacin will be continued for a total of 10 days, and cultures are pending.
5. Morbid obesity: The patient is undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and immobility, there is a risk of developing DVT.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient was on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to the critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The cardiac arrest was likely secondary to a pulmonary embolism causing primary respiratory arrest. The patient has shown improvement in neurologic status after weaning sedation and respiratory failure has been managed by extubation and CPAP/PSV ventilation. His hypertension is being controlled with nitroprusside and medications such as captopril and spironolactone are being considered for weaning off nitroprusside. A urinary tract infection is being treated with ciprofloxacin for a total of 10 days. The patient is also undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery due to morbid obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's initial cardiac arrest was likely caused by a pulmonary embolism. This condition can lead to sudden respiratory distress and potential fatality if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation and was later extubated. However, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to his underlying morbid obesity and any potential complications associated with weaning off ventilatory support.
3. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure that needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or organ damage.
4. Urinary tract infection: Although the patient is receiving treatment for a urinary tract infection, there is a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. The patient has been on heparin and warfarin therapy to prevent further clot formation.

The patient's blood pressure has been high, reaching up to 200 systolic. Nitroprusside has been used to control blood pressure, but attempts to wean off nitroprusside have been unsuccessful so far. The dose of captopril has been increased to 75mg TID and will be further increased throughout the day to 100mg. Spironolactone has also been increased to 50mg.

The patient's neurologic status has improved after sedation was weaned, although he still experiences some anterograde amnesia, which contributes to his anxiety.

The patient was extubated and is doing well on non-invasive ventilation. He will continue to receive nebulizers and CPAP at night, and NC or NRB during the daytime.

A urinary tract infection was identified, and the patient has been on ciprofloxacin for a total of 10 days. Cultures from the nasogastric tube did not show any growth.

The patient has morbid obesity and is undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery. He will continue with this evaluation, and his diet has"

","The patient is a 77-inch-old male with a medical history of obesity, hypertension, and recent cardiac arrest. The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of hypertensive emergency due to uncontrolled blood pressure and acute heart failure. Upon admission, the patient required immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs show a blood pressure of 150/60 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on BiPAP mask, and temperature of 36.8Â°C. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 14 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,726 mL and output of 3,040 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -314 mL since midnight.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including nitroprusside infusion, heparin sodium, captopril, spironolactone, pantoprazole (Protonix), and recently started on coumadin. The patient also has thick secretions in the airway, which may require suctioning.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 237 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 12.0 g/dL, normal sodium (Na+) of 113 mg/dL, low potassium (K+) of 0.7 mg/dL, and"

   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest :  Most likely secondary to PE causing primary
   respiratory arrest.
   - heparin gtt
   - warfarin
   # HTN: as high as 200
s. Nitroprusside ggt SBP<150. Will attempt again
   today to wean off nitro.
   -          captopril at max dose for BP control
   -          Consider adding beta blocker both for BP control and HR
   control as in high 90s (suboptimal for cardiac patients) and or
   diuretic like HCTZ
   # Neurologic status: Improved after weaning sedation although still
   some anterograde amnesia which is contributing to his anxiety.
   # Respiratory Failure:
   - Extubated, doing well
   - nebulizers
   - CPAP at night, NC or NRB during day time
   # UTI:
   - Continue Cipro, for total of 10 days (last dose [**2165-4-17**])
   -  cultures: NGTD
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Patient has morbid obesity and is currently
   undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass.

","Summary:
- 36-year-old male with morbid obesity admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home.
- Most likely cause of cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest.
- Patient has been in the ICU, receiving various treatments including heparin and warfarin for blood clot prevention, nitroprusside for blood pressure control, and medications for hypertension, neurologic status, respiratory failure, and urinary tract infection.
- The patient was extubated and doing well, but required non-invasive ventilation overnight due to thick secretions.
- The patient has some amnesia regarding the event and is anxious.
- The patient is currently undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still high despite being on nitroprusside. There is a potential risk of hypotension if the dose of nitroprusside is increased or if other medications for hypertension are added.
2. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels have been fluctuating, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing slightly, which could lead to bleeding complications. Regular monitoring of platelet count is needed.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has been experiencing thick secretions and required non-invasive ventilation overnight. There is a potential risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia"

   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   # Cardiac Arrest :  Most likely secondary to PE causing primary
   respiratory arrest.
   - continue heparin gtt until
   - continue warfarin, increase rate today to 10mg
   # HTN: as high as 200

   today to wean off nitro.
   - At max dose captopril
   - increased spironolactone ot 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Start amlodipine.
   - wean nitro as able
   # Neurologic status: Improved after weaning sedation although still
   some anterograde amnesia which is contributing to his anxiety.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The likely cause of the cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. The patient has been in the ICU and received various treatments including heparin, warfarin, nitroprusside, captopril, spironolactone, and amlodipine.

The patient's current condition shows improved neurologic status after weaning sedation, although he still exhibits some anterograde amnesia contributing to his anxiety. He has also shown improvement in respiratory failure and was successfully extubated. The patient is being supported with CPAP at night and NC or NRB during the daytime.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) for which he is being treated with Ciprofloxacin for a total of 10 days. He also has morbid obesity and is undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still high despite the use of nitroprusside and captopril. There is a risk of further hypotension if the doses are increased or if the medications are not effectively controlled.

2. Respiratory distress: Although the patient has shown improvement in respiratory failure and was successfully extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory distress due to underlying lung injury"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. The patient's vital signs are currently stable with a blood pressure ranging from 126/50-173/96 mmHg, heart rate between 67-107 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 95%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including heparin and nitroprusside infusions to manage high blood pressure and prevent further clotting. He has also been prescribed medications such as captopril and spironolactone to help control his blood pressure. The patient's neurologic status has improved after weaning off sedation, although he still experiences some anterograde amnesia, which contributes to his anxiety.

The patient was extubated successfully and is currently on CPAP at night and nasal cannula or NRB during the daytime for respiratory support. He is being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with ciprofloxacin for a total of 10 days. The patient has been evaluated for gastric bypass surgery due to his morbid obesity and is undergoing outpatient evaluation for the procedure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a chief complaint of hypertension, which led to the initiation of amlodipine, captopril, and spironolactone. Nitroprusside was also administered but discontinued at 12 pm. The patient's blood pressure remained elevated in the afternoon, prompting an increase in amlodipine dosage. Respiratory issues were noted overnight, with coughing fits and the development of basilar rales. Lasix 40mg IV was given. The patient's oxygen saturation has been stable on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask, but they experienced a few episodes of coughing fits. 

The patient's vital signs show fluctuations in blood pressure, with readings ranging from 130s/50s to 150s/60s. Heart rate remains within normal limits. Respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 26 breaths per minute. Temperature is within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in the current temperature. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,134 mL and output of 5,700 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,566 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been given Lasix 40mg IV. 

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2 of 82 mmHg, suggesting a mild respiratory acidosis. 

Physical examination findings include stable peripheral pulses and skin, but neurologic assessment is incomplete due to the patient's unresponsiveness. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, D-dimer, lactic acid, LDH, and troponin-T levels. Other lab values, including potassium, sodium, chloride, glucose, and liver enzymes, are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include delirium/confusion, hypertension, impaired physical mobility, alteration in nutrition, ineffective coping, cardiac arrest, obesity, hypoxemia, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the progress note, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's persistent hypertension despite medication adjustments may lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney injury.
2. Respiratory infection: The presence of basilar rales and coughing fits raises concern for a possible respiratory infection, which can worsen if not appropriately managed.
3. Fluid imbalance: The negative fluid balance indicates ongoing fluid loss, which can result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and kidney dysfunction.
4. Delirium: The patient's confusion and unresponsiveness could be indicative of delirium, potentially caused by underlying medical conditions or ICU stay itself.
5. Cardiac complications: The elevated troponin-T level suggests myocardial injury, potentially due to the recent cardiac arrest or ongoing cardiac stress.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulable state can increase the risk of DVT formation, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
7. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The cardiac arrest was most likely secondary to a pulmonary embolism causing primary respiratory arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and monitoring.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/73 mmHg to 171/144 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, and his laboratory results show some elevated markers such as D-dimer and troponin-T, but these are likely due to the cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing heparin and warfarin therapy, managing hypertension with medications like spironolactone and potentially adjusting antihypertensive drugs based on blood pressure readings, evaluating neurologic status, managing respiratory failure with CPAP and nebulizers, treating urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin, and considering gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there is a plan to hold amlodipine if the blood pressure remains low"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The cardiac arrest was most likely caused by a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 150/73 to 171/144 mmHg, heart rate between 78 and 103 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on CPAP. The patient's neurologic status has improved after weaning sedation, although he still has some anterograde amnesia contributing to his anxiety. He was successfully extubated and is doing well. The patient has a history of hypertension, for which he is currently taking amlodipine, captopril, and spironolactone. His renal function tests show elevated creatinine levels, and his blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Other lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient is also being treated for a urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin and continues to receive prophylactic antibiotics for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being monitored, and he is undergoing evaluation for gastric bypass surgery due to morbid obesity.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest was a pulmonary embolism leading to primary respiratory arrest. The patient has been in the ICU and received various treatments including heparin, warfarin, captopril, spironolactone, and amlodipine for hypertension. Nitroprusside was used to control blood pressure, but it needs to be weaned off. The patient's neurologic status has improved after sedation weaning, but he still experiences some anterograde amnesia contributing to anxiety. He was successfully extubated and is doing well with respiratory support through nebulizers and CPAP. 

The patient also had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and was given ciprofloxacin for 10 days. He has morbid obesity and is undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The PT/INR is elevated, indicating a potential bleeding risk due to anticoagulation therapy. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Bleeding due to elevated PT/INR from anticoagulation therapy.
2. Worsening hypertension despite medication adjustments.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a morbidly obese male who was admitted with a cardiac arrest. Upon admission, the patient was intubated, mechanically ventilated, and received aggressive resuscitation. The patient's initial blood pressure was very high, so they started him on amlodipine, captopril, and spironolactone. Nitroprusside was also initiated but discontinued at 12pm when the blood pressure improved to the 130s/50s. However, the blood pressure again rose to the 150s/60s in the afternoon, prompting an increase in the dose of amlodipine.

The patient's respiratory status has been relatively stable, with SaO2 maintained on NC O2. However, the patient experienced a couple of coughing fits overnight and developed basal rales, for which Lasix 40mg IV was administered.

The patient was extubated and is now alert and oriented to year and hospital. However, they still require CPAP mask for oxygen delivery due to persistent hypoxemia. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for limited assessment of the heart and lungs due to body habitus.

Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, and elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating cardiac injury. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab results such as liver function tests, renal"

The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. His respiratory status has stabilized, and he has been extubated. He is currently on several medications including heparin, warfarin, captopril, amlodipine, and spironolactone. The patient's neurologic status has improved, but he still has some anterograde amnesia contributing to his anxiety. He is being seen by a neurologist today.

The patient has been experiencing a dry cough and respiratory crackles at night, which have responded well to Lasix IV and nebulizers. It is believed that these symptoms are a combination of congestive heart failure (CHF) and bronchospasm. He is currently on CPAP at night and NC or NRB during the day.

His urine culture was negative, and he has completed a total of 10 days of Cipro for a urinary tract infection (UTI). He also has morbid obesity and is undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: Given the patient's symptoms of dry cough and respiratory crackles at night, along with his history of CHF, there is a potential for pulmonary edema. This can be monitored through respiratory assessment and chest X-ray.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized and"

   # Cardiac Arrest :  Most likely secondary to PE causing primary
   respiratory arrest.
   - continue heparin gtt until
   - continue warfarin bridge for 2 days INR>2
   # HTN: improvement is noted. Currently on spironolactone, thus cannot
   eval for 1o or 2o hyperaldosteronism. Random cortisol sent and pnd.
   This morning his BP is low with standing. Will monitor and hold
   amlodipine morning dose. If BP remains low the dc amlodipine and
   decrease captopril for SBP100-120.
   - off nitroprusside
   # Neurologic status: Improved after weaning sedation although still
   some anterograde amnesia which is contributing to his anxiety.
   # Respiratory Failure:
   - Extubated, doing well
   - nebulizers
   - CPAP at night, NC or NRB during day time
   # UTI:
   - Continue Cipro, for total of 10 days (last dose [**2165-4-17**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. It is believed that the cardiac arrest was secondary to a pulmonary embolism causing primary respiratory arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement in several areas.

Neurologic status: The patient's neurologic status has improved since weaning off sedation. However, he still exhibits some anterograde amnesia which contributes to his anxiety.

Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated and is doing well. He is currently on CPAP at night and NC or NRB during the daytime.

Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, but there are concerns about possible secondary causes of hypertension. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this is primary or secondary hypertension. The patient is currently on spironolactone, so it is not possible to evaluate for primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism at this time. A random cortisol level has been sent for analysis.

UTI: The patient is being treated with Cipro for a total of 10 days to address a urinary tract infection. Cultures from the NG tube are pending.

Morbid obesity: The patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery. He will continue with this outpatient evaluation, and his case has been discussed with PT (likely physical therapy) consultants.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. His respiratory status has been stabilized, and he is currently extubated. The patient's main concerns include potential complications related to his cardiac arrest, hypertension, neurologic status, respiratory failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), morbid obesity, and fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely secondary to a pulmonary embolism (PE) causing primary respiratory arrest. Heparin has been initiated, and warfarin therapy will be continued to prevent further clot formation.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, but he still requires medication management. The goal is to maintain a stable blood pressure between 100-120 mmHg. Captopril, amlodipine, and spironolactone will continue to be administered.

3. Neurologic status: The patient's neurologic status has improved after weaning sedation, although he still experiences some anterograde amnesia, which contributes to his anxiety. A neurology consultation is planned for further evaluation.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has developed a dry cough and respiratory crackles at night, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF) and bronchospasm. Nebulizers and CPAP therapy will be continued as per the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old morbidly obese male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest at home. His respiratory status has stabilized, but he is still experiencing some neurological issues, such as anterograde amnesia and anxiety. The patient's blood pressure has improved with the use of antihypertensive medications, but he still requires close monitoring due to his history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and bronchospasm. He has completed a course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is no longer exhibiting any signs of infection. The patient is currently undergoing outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass surgery to address his morbid obesity. His current medications include heparin, warfarin, captopril, amlodipine, spironolactone, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's immobility and history of obesity, he is at an increased risk of developing blood clots in his legs. Prophylaxis measures, such as heparin, have been initiated to prevent DVT.
2. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcers due to his critical condition and prolonged ICU stay. Prophylactic medications, such as pantoprazole, have been prescribed to prevent this complication.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia"
