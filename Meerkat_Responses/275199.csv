   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   In the am the patient became hypotensive to the 70's and hypoxia to the
   80's.  He was given IVF and started on levophed with improvement of his
   pressures initally.  His FiO2 was increased to 60% with improvement of
   his hypoxia.  The levophed was uptitrated, however on the max dose he
   again dropped his pressures to the 70's and was started on
   norepinephrine.

   69M with multiple medical problems including DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic
   anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory and cardiac arrests with
   hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and DIC. The exact nature
   of these events is unclear, but he has had worsening renal function
   over the past week, leading to electrolyte disturbances and possibly an
   arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with spontaneous return of circulation
   prior to the arrival of EMS.
   # Respiratory Failure:
   unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac history suggests cardiac arrest
   as well as his positive cardiac enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood
   pressure per EMS in the field. PE a possibility, but gas shortly after
   intubation showed good oxygenation.
   - vent support, can wean O2
   - fentanyl, versed for comfort while on mechanical ventilation
   # shock, hypothermia: It is uncelar whether he is in septic shock or
   cardiogenic shock.  His SBPs continue to drop with unclear
   precipitant.  He does not appear septic, and is currently perfusing, as
   evidenced by downtrending lactate.  Cortisol is elevated and his TSH is
   WNL.  His mixed venous oyxgen sat was only 44, suggesting a component
   of cardiogenic shock.
   - serial lactate
   - volume resuscitation
   - given unclear etiology of current state, will check cultures of
   blood, urine, sputum if any, and cover with broad spectrum
   vanc/cefepime
   - pressors as needed for pressure support including levophed,
   norepinephrine, and dobutamine
   - warming blanket for hyptension
   # unresponsiveness: received minimal sedation in ED, but not responding
   to sternal rub on arrival in ICU. coagulopathy creates high risk for
   bleeding; will check non-con head CT
   # DIC: TTP is in the differential, esp with ARF, MS change, low plts,
   anemia, but would not explain low fibrinogen
   elevated PT, PTT, low platelets, fibrinogen low at 94 on arrival and
   now down to 68 down to <35; FDP, D-dimer elevated at 8754 and FDP of >
   1280 all fit with DIC.
   - cryo to goal fibrinogen > 100
   - will need correction of coagulopathy (plts, FFP) prior to re-siting
   central line
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 28-30, given concern for
   myocardial ischemia
   - heme c/s given his complicated picture and history of aplastic
   anemia.
   # CAD:
   pt with extensive CAD history, including prior revascularizations and
   recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital arrest, although he
   had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG with signs of hyperkalemia on
   arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after resolution of hyperK
   suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin positive, rules in for
   NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or secondary to brief
   circulatory collapse followed by return of circulation, as would be the
   case with VT/VF that spontaneously terminated.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF:
   known EF 15-20%
   - repeat echo today to eval for new WMA
   - No acei or B-blocker given hypotension.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists, now doubled in the 4
s.  Differential includes ATN from
   hypotension, TTP, other intrarenal causes.  Less likely prerenal or
   postrenal given his other issues.  Osm gap was elevated at 13.  FENA of
   0.4 suggests prerenal, but given the extent of his hypotension and rise
   in his Cr, more likely to be ATN.
   - check cyclosporin level (pt may have been taking CSA even though
   directed not to)
   - volume resuscitation with isotonic bicarb, which will also help
   correct metabolic acidosis
   - re-dose kayexalate, as K still up
   - serial electrolytes
   - Add on methenol given elevated osm gap.
   - renal consult
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # shock liver: The patient
s LFTs continue to be elevated, likely due
   to ongoing hypotension.  The elevated T bili is likely in part from
   hemolytic anemia, but massive elevations in all liver enzymes c/w shock
   liver.
   - continue to trend.
   # DM2:
   - monitor sugars, may need insulin gtt
   # Access: femoral line; will need to change to SC/IJ when able. Place
   aline if possible; pt has PVD and has been difficult to drawn abgs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and now presents with respiratory and cardiac arrests. The patient has hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemolytic anemia superimposed on aplastic anemia, and a history of recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving vasopressor support due to hypotension. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There may be a need for weaning off oxygen.
2. Shock: The patient's blood pressure continues to drop, suggesting possible septic or cardiogenic shock. Volume resuscitation and pressors may be required.
3. Unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive to voice and only withdraws to pain. Further evaluation, including a head CT, is needed.
4. DIC: The patient has elevated PT/PTT, low platelets, and fibrinogen levels, indicating disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Coagulopathy correction is necessary.
5. Hemolytic anemia: The patient has a low hematoc"

   He is currently perfusing, as evidenced by downtrending lactate.
   - serial lactate
   - volume resuscitation with IVF
   - given unclear etiology of current state will cover with broad
   spectrum vanc/cefepime
   - pressors as needed for pressure support including levophed,
   dobutamine, and vasopressin
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - Will transfuse 2 units PRBC to volume expand and have a Hct goal of >

   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - fentanyl, versed for comfort while on mechanical ventilation
   # unresponsiveness: received minimal sedation in ED, but not responding
   to sternal rub on arrival in ICU. coagulopathy creates high risk for
   bleeding.  Could also be due to seizure activity if a bleed is
   present.  Also could have hypoxic encephalopathy as it was unclear how
   well he was oxygenating when he was found.  He had a Utox which was
   negative, but substances should be consider as a cuase of mental status
   change.
   - once stabilized obtain a head CT to rule out bleed.
   # DIC: TTP is in the differential, esp with ARF, MS change, low plts,

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease, and recent respiratory and cardiac arrests. He presented with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's current condition includes hypotension requiring multiple pressors, unclear etiology of shock (possibly septic or cardiogenic), respiratory failure, unresponsiveness, DIC, hemolytic anemia superimposed on aplastic anemia, extensive coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and shock liver. The patient's goals include maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60, achieving a hematocrit (Hct) goal of greater than 30, maintaining a pH goal of greater than 7.2, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, obtaining a head CT to rule out bleeding, correcting coagulopathy, supportive transfusion to goal Hct 30, monitoring cardiac enzymes and daily EKG, repeating echo today to evaluate for new wall motion abnormality (WMA), and renal consult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which could be due to septic or cardiogenic shock. It is important to maintain a MAP greater than 60 and continue with volume resuscitation and appropriate pressor"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   In the am the patient became hypotensive to the 70's and hypoxia to the
   80's.  He was given IVF and started on levophed with improvement of his
   pressures initally.  His FiO2 was increased to 60% with improvement of
   his hypoxia.  The levophed was uptitrated, however on the max dose he
   again dropped his pressures to the 70's and was started on
   norepinephrine.

   69M with multiple medical problems including DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic
   anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory and cardiac arrests with
   hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and DIC. The exact nature
   of these events is unclear, but he has had worsening renal function
   over the past week, leading to electrolyte disturbances and possibly an
   arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with spontaneous return of circulation
   prior to the arrival of EMS.
   # Respiratory Failure:
   unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac history suggests cardiac arrest
   as well as his positive cardiac enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood
   pressure per EMS in the field. PE a possibility, but gas shortly after
   intubation showed good oxygenation.
   - vent support, can wean O2
   - fentanyl, versed for comfort while on mechanical ventilation
   # shock, hypothermia: It is uncelar whether he is in septic shock or
   cardiogenic shock.  His SBPs continue to drop with unclear precipitant.
    He does not appear septic, and is currently perfusing, as evidenced by
   downtrending lactate.  Cortisol is elevated and his TSH is WNL.
   - serial lactate
   - volume resuscitation
   - given unclear etiology of current state, will check cultures of
   blood, urine, sputum if any, and cover with broad spectrum
   vanc/cefepime
   - warming blanket for hyptension
   # unresponsiveness: received minimal sedation in ED, but not responding
   to sternal rub on arrival in ICU. coagulopathy creates high risk for
   bleeding; will check non-con head CT
   # DIC: TTP is in the differential, esp with ARF, MS change, low plts,
   anemia, but would not explain low fibrinogen
   elevated PT, PTT, low platelets, fibrinogen low at 94 on arrival and
   now down to 68; FDP, D-dimer pending, but other labs highly suggestive.
   - cryo to goal fibrinogen > 100
   - will need correction of coagulopathy (plts, FFP) prior to re-siting
   central line
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 28-30, given concern for
   myocardial ischemia
   - heme c/s in am for CBC and coag abnormalities
   # CAD:
   pt with extensive CAD history, including prior revascularizations and
   recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital arrest; had perfusing
   BP in the field. EKG with signs of hyperkalemia on arrival but
   pseudonormalization in ant leads after resolution of hyperK suggests
   ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which
   may have been primary event or secondary to brief circulatory collapse
   followed by return of circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that
   spontaneously terminated.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF:
   known EF 15-20%
   - repeat echo today to eval for new WMA
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists.
   - check cyclosporin level (pt may have been taking CSA even though
   directed not to)
   - urine lytes
   - volume resuscitation with isotonic bicarb, which will also help
   correct metabolic acidosis
   - re-dose kayexalate, as K still up
   - serial electrolytes
   - calculate osm gap given gap acidosis to rule out toxin-mediated cause
   of renal failure
   - renal consult in am; given coagulalopathy, unlikely that it would be
   feasible to start HD now, so no emergent need tonight
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # shock liver: elevated AST, ALT may be partly from muscle breakdown if
   there is rhabdo, and elevated T bili is likely in part from hemolytic
   anemia, but massive elevations in all liver enzymes c/w shock liver.
   continue to trend.
   # elevated CK: CK <9000; CK-MB unremarkable, suggesting skeletal muscle
   breakdown in addition to the cardiac ischemia that is evidenced by the
   positive troponin.
   - trend CK
   - volume resuscitation as above
   # DM2:
   - monitor sugars, may need insulin gtt
   # Access: femoral line; will need to change to SC/IJ when able. Place
   aline if possible; pt has PVD and has been difficult to drawn abgs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease, who experienced respiratory and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The exact cause of these events is unclear, but he has had worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is uncertainty regarding the precipitant of respiratory failure. It could be due to a cardiac arrest or pulmonary embolism (PE). Monitoring oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial.
2. Shock: The patient's blood pressures continue to drop with an unclear precipitant. It is unclear whether he is in septic shock or cardiogenic shock. Given his extensive cardiac history and positive cardiac enzymes, cardiac arrest is a possibility. Serial lactate levels should be monitored, and volume resuscitation may be necessary.
3. Unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive to voice and only withdraws to pain. This could be due to the effects of sedation or underlying brain injury. A non-contrast head CT should be performed to rule out any intracranial pathology.

   Assessment and Plan
   Shock, severe.  Concern for sepsis on background of cardiomyopathy.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Significant resp.
   decompensation in the field, indicating possible pneumonia, CHF, COPD
   exacerbation, or respiratory response to acidemia (lactic acidosis,
   renal failure, sepsis).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG --> aim for SaO2 > 90%, pO2 > 60 mmHg, pH> 7.30.  Monitor for
   pneumonia (LLL).
   HYPOTENSION -- multifactorial; principal concerns include severe
   sepsis, hypovolemia, and component of cardiogenic shock (baseline
   cardiomyopathy).  ELevated cardiac enzymes suggest component of
   ischedmia, but may be secondary.  Plan continue volume resussutation,
   vasopressors (including trial of vasopressin) including Dobutamine.
   Transfuse with colloid, transfuse with PRBC.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- hypothermia, low neutrophil count.
   NEUTROPENIA -- approaching absolute neutrophilia --> empirical
   antimicrobials (Vanco, Cefopime).
   HYPOTHERMIA -- concern for severe sepsis, possible component of
   cardiogenic shock
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic.  Contributing to acidosis.
   Attributed to hypovolemia and shock --> now with evidence for uremia.
   Plan volume resussitation
   CPK elevation -- Concern for rhabdomyalysis.  continue HCO3 infusion.
   Monitor urine output.
   ELEVATED LFT's -- probable significant component of shock liver, but

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of aplastic anemia, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, vasculopathy, severe coronary artery disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 15%, peripheral vascular disease, and previous cardiac arrest. The patient was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest.

The patient remains critically ill with respiratory failure, likely due to a multifactorial cause including pneumonia, congestive heart failure, COPD exacerbation, or respiratory response to acidemia. The patient is still intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. There are concerns for sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, suggesting possible myocardial ischemia or infarction.

The patient has renal failure, which is acute on chronic, contributing to metabolic acidosis. There is also evidence of uremia. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating probable shock liver.

Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive to tactile stimuli, with flaccid motor examination. There is concern for possible hypoxemic encephalopathy or subsequent hypotensive insult. Serum and urine toxicology tests are negative, and there are no concerns for meningitis or encephalitis at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   Shock, severe.  Concern for sepsis on background of cardiomyopathy.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Significant resp.
   decompensation in the field, indicating possible pneumonia, CHF, COPD
   exacerbation, or respiratory response to acidemia (lactic acidosis,
   renal failure, sepsis).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG --> aim for SaO2 > 90%, pO2 > 60 mmHg, pH> 7.30.  Monitor for
   pneumonia (LLL).
   HYPOTENSION -- multifactorial; principal concerns include severe
   sepsis, hypovolemia, and component of cardiogenic shock (baseline
   cardiomyopathy).  ELevated cardiac enzymes suggest component of
   ischedmia, but may be secondary.  Plan continue volume resussutation,
   vasopressors (including trial of vasopressin) including Dobutamine.
   Transfuse with colloid, transfuse with PRBC.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- hypothermia, low neutrophil count.
   NEUTROPENIA -- approaching absolute neutrophilia --> empirical
   antimicrobials (Vanco, Cefopime).
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 worsening.  In setting of schistocytes, concern for
   TTP/HUS.  Hematology consult.
   ANEMIA
 aplastic anemia as background.  Worsening, suggesting of
   hemolytic anemia. Transfuse.  Hematololgy consult.
   HYPOTHERMIA -- concern for severe sepsis, possible component of
   cardiogenic shock
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic.  Contributing to acidosis.
   Attributed to hypovolemia and shock --> now with evidence for uremia.
   Plan volume resussitation
   CPK elevation -- Concern for rhabdomyalysis.  continue HCO3 infusion.
   Monitor urine output.
   ELEVATED LFT's -- probable significant component of shock liver, but
   may have predated hypotension.
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- unresponsive to tactile stimulus, flaccid motor
   exam.  Concern for possible hypoxemic encephalopathy (or subsequent
   hypotensive insult).  Serum and urine toxin negative.  No concerns for
   meningitis or encephalitis at this time.  Head CT when clinically
   stable to assess for intracranial hemorrhage.  TTP may explain mental
   status change.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated, requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive with flaccid motor exam. There are signs of sepsis, including hypothermia, low neutrophil count, and elevated inflammatory markers. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, and possible rhabdomyolysis. A hematology consult is recommended due to concerns of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) and aplastic anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypothermia, low neutrophil count, and elevated inflammatory markers suggest a possible septic state. Prompt initiation of empirical antimicrobials is necessary.
2. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Given the presence of respiratory failure, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, there is a risk of further organ dysfunction.
3. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TTP/HUS): The patient's thrombocytopenia, schistocytes on blood smear, and neurological symptoms raise concern for TTP/HUS. A hem"

   the 80's.  He was given IVF and started on levophed which was max'ed
   out and then he was started on dobutamine with good effect.  Also
   responded well to IVF.  Was able to come off dobutamine in the pm.
   Weaning down levophed overnight.
   - BP's have been stable in 100's overnight, has woken up a little,
   opened his eyes when his family said his name
   - Received 1u pRBC overnight for hct of 28 (goal >30), repeat hct was

 HYPOTHERMIA
   69M with DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory
   and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure,
   and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, but he has had
   worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte
   disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with
   spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of EMS now
   admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors.
   # Shock: It is uncelar whether he is in septic shock or cardiogenic
   shock.  Given improvement in status with aggressive fliuds and
   antibiotics, would favor distributive shock with an infectious
   etiology.  His SBPs are holding in the 100
s-110
s.  Still requiring
   levophed for bp support.  BP
s also responded well to IVF though UOP
   remains low and renal function worsening.  Received 2 units yesterday
   morning and an additional unit overnight, hct at 29 this morning,
   stable.  Brachial A-line placed overnight by anesthesia.
   - volume resuscitation with IVF
 use D5 to correct hypernatremia but
   will also need NS for volume repletion, can control Na with free water
   boluses once start tube feeds
   - given unclear etiology of current state and neutropenia continue
   broad spectrum vanc/cefepime
   - pressors as needed for pressure support
 on levophed
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - tranfuse for goal hct>30
   - Monitor pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2
   - If stable, would get CT torso, with po contrast
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely [**2-27**] overwhelming sepsis, renal failure.
   pH normalize but still with low bicarb [**2-27**] ARF
   - needs bicarb
   - serial ABG
s and lytes to monitor
   - abx as above
   - renal following , appreciate recs
   # Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: Unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac
   history suggests cardiac arrest as well as his positive cardiac
   enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood pressure per EMS in the field. PE
   is less likely at a gas shortly after intubation showed good
   oxygenation.   PNA less likely as CXR does not suggest it.  Have been
   able to wean down PEEP and decrease FiO2 ro 40%.  Last gas:
   7.4/30/191/19 showing a mixed  respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - has been off sedation
   # Unresponsiveness: Improving. Received minimal sedation in ED, but not
   responding to sternal rub on arrival in ICU. coagulopathy creates high
   risk for bleeding.  Could also be due to seizure activity if a bleed is
   present.  Also could have hypoxic encephalopathy as it was unclear how
   well he was oxygenating when he was found.  He had a Utox which was
   negative, but substances should be consider as a cause of mental status
   change.   He is now moving all 4 extremities, withdraws to pain and
   opened his eyes in reponse to his family
s voices.
   - needs a head CT today to rule out bleed
   - has been off sedation as above
   # DIC: Heme consulted
 do not think there is TTP though it remains in
   the differential, given his with ARF, MS change, low plts, anemia, but
   would not explain low fibrinogen elevated PT, PTT, low platelets,
   fibrinogen low at 94 on arrival and was down to 68 down to <35, now
   improved above 100; FDP, D-dimer were elevated at 8754 and FDP of >
   1280 which all fit with DIC
 likely from an infectious cause.   No
   plasmapheresis for now per heme.  INR this [**Last Name (un) 3698**] improved to 2.8
   - will need correction of coagulopathy (plts, FFP) prior to re-siting
   central line
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 30, given concern for myocardial
   ischemia
   - heme following, appreciate recs.
   # CAD: Pt with extensive CAD history, including prior
   revascularizations and recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital
   arrest, although he had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG had signs of
   hyperkalemia on arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after
   resolution of hyperK suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin
   positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or
   secondary to brief circulatory collapse followed by return of
   circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that spontaneously
   terminated.  Enzymes trending up likely multifactorial from end organ
   ischemia and renal failure.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF: Known EF 15-20%
   - echo ordered  to eval for new WMA
   - No ACE-I or B-blocker given hypotension.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists, now doubled in the 4
s on admission now stable at 4.9
   this morning  Differential includes ATN from hypotension, TTP, other
   intrarenal causes.  Less likely prerenal or postrenal given his other
   issues.  Osm gap was elevated at 13.  FENA of 0.4 suggests prerenal,
   but given the extent of his hypotension and rise in his Cr, more likely
   to be ATN.
   - pending cyclosporin level (pt may have been taking CSA even though
   directed not to)
   - continue volume resuscitation as above with D5 and NS
   - serial electrolytes
   - renal following, appreciate recs, may get CVVH today after line
   placement though Cr is plateaued at 4.9 this morning
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - ionized Ca was low, replete check with pm lytes
   # shock liver: The patient
s LFTs continue to be elevated, likely due
   to hypoperfusion in setting of prolonged hypotension.  The elevated T
   bili is likely in part from hemolytic anemia, but massive elevations in
   all liver enzymes c/w shock liver.
   - continue to trend.
   - Elevated CKs and LFTs could also be concerning for rhabdo in the
   setting of ARF.  IVF with bicarb for alkalization of her urine given a
   possibility of rhabdo.
   # Hypernatremia: 150 this morning, likely [**2-27**] to aggressive fluids with
   sodium bicarb
   - will give D5 for free water replacement though will still need bicarb
   given likely rhabo
   - pm lytes, trend
   # DM2:  Sugar 47 overnight, got 1 amp D50 with good result, has been
   off insulin drip since yesterday
   - monitor sugars, may need insulin gtt
   # Access: femoral line; will need to change to SC/IJ when able. A line
   placed.  Will need CVVH line
 renal to place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease, who presented with respiratory and cardiac arrests. The patient's current condition is characterized by impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, shock, acute renal failure, anemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), cardiomyopathy, liver function abnormalities, hypothermia, and other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors, indicating possible septic or cardiogenic shock. The exact cause is unclear, but the patient's condition improved with aggressive fluids and antibiotics, suggesting an infectious etiology.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, likely due to overwhelming sepsis and acute renal failure. The pH is currently normal, but the patient requires bicarbonate supplementation and serial ABG monitoring.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with uncertain precipitants. Extensive cardiac history suggests cardiac arrest as a possible cause, but the patient had a perfusing blood pressure during the event. The patient has been weaned off sedation, and minimal ventilatory support is required.

4. Unresponsiveness: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be attributed to coagulopathy,"

 HYPOTHERMIA
   69M with DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory
   and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure,
   and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, but he has had
   worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte
   disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with
   spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of EMS now
   admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors.
   # Shock: It is uncelar whether he is in septic shock or cardiogenic
   shock.  Given improvement in status with aggressive fliuds and
   antibiotics, would favor distributive shock with an infectious
   etiology.  His SBPs are holding in the 100
s-110
s.  Still requiring
   levophed for bp support.  BP
s also responded well to IVF though UOP
   remains low and renal function worsening.  Received 2 units yesterday
   morning and an additional unit overnight, hct at 29 this morning,
   stable.  Brachial A-line placed overnight by anesthesia.
   - volume resuscitation with IVF
   - given unclear etiology of current state and neutropenia continue
   broad spectrum vanc/cefepime
   - pressors as needed for pressure support
 on levophed
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - tranfuse for goal hct>30
   - Monitor pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2
   # Respiratory Failure: Unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac history
   suggests cardiac arrest as well as his positive cardiac enzymes, but pt
   had perfusing blood pressure per EMS in the field. PE is less likely at
   a gas shortly after intubation showed good oxygenation.   PNA less
   likely as CXR does not suggest it.  Have been able to wean down PEEP
   and decrease FiO2 ro 40%.  Last gas:  7.4/30/191/19 showing a mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - has been off sedation
   # Unresponsiveness: Improving. Received minimal sedation in ED, but not
   responding to sternal rub on arrival in ICU. coagulopathy creates high
   risk for bleeding.  Could also be due to seizure activity if a bleed is
   present.  Also could have hypoxic encephalopathy as it was unclear how
   well he was oxygenating when he was found.  He had a Utox which was
   negative, but substances should be consider as a cause of mental status
   change.   He is now moving all 4 extremities, withdraws to pain and
   opened his eyes in reponse to his family
s voices.
   - needs a head CT today to rule out bleed.
   - has been off sedation as above
   # DIC: Heme consulted
 do not think there is TTP though it remains in
   the differential, given his with ARF, MS change, low plts, anemia, but
   would not explain low fibrinogen elevated PT, PTT, low platelets,
   fibrinogen low at 94 on arrival and was down to 68 down to <35, now
   improved above 100; FDP, D-dimer were elevated at 8754 and FDP of >
   1280 which all fit with DIC
 likely from an infectious cause.   No
   plasmapheresis for now per heme.  INR this [**Last Name (un) 3698**] improved to 2.8
   - will need correction of coagulopathy (plts, FFP) prior to re-siting
   central line
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 30, given concern for myocardial
   ischemia
   - heme following, appreciate recs.
   # CAD: Pt with extensive CAD history, including prior
   revascularizations and recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital
   arrest, although he had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG had signs of
   hyperkalemia on arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after
   resolution of hyperK suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin
   positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or
   secondary to brief circulatory collapse followed by return of
   circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that spontaneously
   terminated.  Enzymes trending up likely multifactorial from end organ
   ischemia and renal failure.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF: Known EF 15-20%
   - echo ordered  to eval for new WMA
   - No ACE-I or B-blocker given hypotension.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists, now doubled in the 4
s on admission now stable at 4.9
   this morning  Differential includes ATN from hypotension, TTP, other
   intrarenal causes.  Less likely prerenal or postrenal given his other
   issues.  Osm gap was elevated at 13.  FENA of 0.4 suggests prerenal,
   but given the extent of his hypotension and rise in his Cr, more likely
   to be ATN.
   - check cyclosporin level (pt may have been taking CSA even though
   directed not to)
   - continue volume resuscitation with isotonic bicarb, which will also
   help correct metabolic acidosis
   - serial electrolytes
   - renal following, appreciate recs, will likely get CVVH today after
   line placement
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # shock liver: The patient
s LFTs continue to be elevated, likely due
   to hypoperfusion in setting of prolonged hypotension.  The elevated T
   bili is likely in part from hemolytic anemia, but massive elevations in
   all liver enzymes c/w shock liver.
   - continue to trend.
   - Elevated CKs and LFTs could also be concerning for rhabdo in the
   setting of ARF.  IVF with bicarb for alkalization of her urine given a
   possibility of rhabdo.
   # DM2:
   - monitor sugars, may need insulin gtt
   # Access: femoral line; will need to change to SC/IJ when able. A line
   placed.  Will need CVVH line
 renal to place.

   Assessment and Plan
   Shock, severe.  Concern for sepsis on background of cardiomyopathy.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Significant resp.
   decompensation in the field, indicating possible pneumonia, CHF, COPD
   exacerbation, or respiratory response to acidemia (lactic acidosis,
   renal failure, sepsis).  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG --> aim for SaO2 > 90%, pO2 > 60 mmHg, pH> 7.30.  Monitor for
   pneumonia (LLL).
   HYPOTENSION -- multifactorial; principal concerns include severe
   sepsis, hypovolemia, and component of cardiogenic shock (baseline
   cardiomyopathy).  ELevated cardiac enzymes suggest component of
   ischedmia, but may be secondary.  Plan continue volume resussutation,
   vasopressors (including trial of vasopressin) including Dobutamine.
   Transfuse with colloid, transfuse with PRBC.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- Moves to tactile stimulus, flaccid right UE
   motor exam.  Concern for possible intracranial hemorrhage, or hypoxemic
   encephalopathy (or subsequent hypotensive insult).  Serum and urine
   toxin negative.  No concerns for meningitis or encephalitis at this
   time.  Head CT today to assess for intracranial hemorrhage.  TTP may
   explain mental status change.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- provide free H2O.  Monitor Na q 6-8 hr.
   ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES -- continue to increase, concerning for
   significant cardiac ischemia.  Suspect secondary insult rather than
   primary cardiac event.
   SEPSIS -- hypothermia, low neutrophil count.  Continue empirical
   antimicrobials.  Consider imaging abdomen & pelvis, although RUQ U/S.
   NEUTROPENIA -- absolute neutropenia --> empirical antimicrobials
   (Vanco, Cefopime, Flagyl).
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 worsening.  In setting of schistocytes, concern for
   TTP/HUS.  Hematology consult opinion that DIC more likley than TTP.
   ANEMIA
 aplastic anemia as background.  Worsening, suggesting of
   hemolytic anemia. Transfuse.  Hematololgy consult.
   HYPOTHERMIA -- concern for severe sepsis, possible component of
   cardiogenic shock.  Resolved.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic.  Contributing to acidosis.
   Attributed to hypovolemia and shock --> now with evidence for uremia.
   Plan continue volume resussitation.
   CPK elevation -- Concern for rhabdomyalysis.  continue HCO3 infusion.
   Monitor urine output.
   ELEVATED LFT's -- probable significant component of shock liver, but
   may have predated hypotension.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF via NGT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient has sepsis and is experiencing respiratory failure due to possible pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, or respiratory response to acidemia.
- The patient is also in shock, which could be due to severe sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiogenic shock. There is evidence of lactic acidosis and renal failure.
- The neurological status of the patient is concerning, with flaccid right upper extremity motor exam and potential intracranial hemorrhage or hypoxemic encephalopathy.
- The patient has hypernatremia, elevated cardiac enzymes, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypothermia, renal failure, CPK elevation, and elevated liver function tests.
- The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and aplastic anemia in the background.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and receiving fluids and blood transfusions.
- The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory
   and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure,
   and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, but he has had
   worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte
   disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with
   spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of EMS now
   admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors.
   # Shock: It is uncelar whether he is in septic shock or cardiogenic
   shock.  Given improvement in status with aggressive fliuds and
   antibiotics, would favor distributive shock with an infectious
   etiology.  His SBPs are holding in the 100
s-110
s.  Still requiring
   levophed for bp support.  BP
s also responded well to IVF though UOP
   remains low and renal function worsening.  Received 2 units yesterday
   morning and an additional unit overnight, hct at 29 this morning,
   stable.  Brachial A-line placed overnight by anesthesia.
   - volume resuscitation with IVF
 use D5 to correct hypernatremia but
   will also need NS for volume repletion, can control Na with free water
   boluses once start tube feeds
   - given unclear etiology of current state and neutropenia continue
   broad spectrum vanc/cefepime
   - pressors as needed for pressure support
 on levophed
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - tranfuse for goal hct>30
   - Monitor pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2
   - If stable, would get CT torso, with po contrast
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely [**2-27**] overwhelming sepsis, renal failure.
   pH normalize but still with low bicarb [**2-27**] ARF
   - needs bicarb
   - serial ABG
s and lytes to monitor
   - abx as above
   - renal following , appreciate recs
   # Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: Unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac
   history suggests cardiac arrest as well as his positive cardiac
   enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood pressure per EMS in the field. PE
   is less likely at a gas shortly after intubation showed good
   oxygenation.   PNA less likely as CXR does not suggest it.  Have been
   able to wean down PEEP and decrease FiO2 ro 40%.  Last gas:
   7.4/30/191/19 showing a mixed  respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - has been off sedation
   # Unresponsiveness: Improving. Received minimal sedation in ED, but not
   responding to sternal rub on arrival in ICU. coagulopathy creates high
   risk for bleeding.  Could also be due to seizure activity if a bleed is
   present.  Also could have hypoxic encephalopathy as it was unclear how
   well he was oxygenating when he was found.  He had a Utox which was
   negative, but substances should be consider as a cause of mental status
   change.   He is now moving all 4 extremities, withdraws to pain and
   opened his eyes in reponse to his family
s voices.
   - needs a head CT today to rule out bleed
   - has been off sedation as above
   # DIC: Heme consulted
 do not think there is TTP though it remains in
   the differential, given his with ARF, MS change, low plts, anemia, but
   would not explain low fibrinogen elevated PT, PTT, low platelets,
   fibrinogen low at 94 on arrival and was down to 68 down to <35, now
   improved above 100; FDP, D-dimer were elevated at 8754 and FDP of >
   1280 which all fit with DIC
 likely from an infectious cause.   No
   plasmapheresis for now per heme.  INR this [**Last Name (un) 3698**] improved to 2.8
   - will need correction of coagulopathy (plts, FFP) prior to re-siting
   central line
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 30, given concern for myocardial
   ischemia
   - heme following, appreciate recs.
   # CAD: Pt with extensive CAD history, including prior
   revascularizations and recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital
   arrest, although he had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG had signs of
   hyperkalemia on arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after
   resolution of hyperK suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin
   positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or
   secondary to brief circulatory collapse followed by return of
   circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that spontaneously
   terminated.  Enzymes trending up likely multifactorial from end organ
   ischemia and renal failure.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF: Known EF 15-20%
   - echo ordered  to eval for new WMA
   - No ACE-I or B-blocker given hypotension.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists, now doubled in the 4
s on admission now stable at 4.9
   this morning  Differential includes ATN from hypotension, TTP, other
   intrarenal causes.  Less likely prerenal or postrenal given his other
   issues.  Osm gap was elevated at 13.  FENA of 0.4 suggests prerenal,
   but given the extent of his hypotension and rise in his Cr, more likely
   to be ATN.
   - pending cyclosporin level (pt may have been taking CSA even though
   directed not to)
   - continue volume resuscitation as above with D5 and NS
   - serial electrolytes
   - renal following, appreciate recs, may get CVVH today after line
   placement though Cr is plateaued at 4.9 this morning
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - ionized Ca was low, replete check with pm lytes
   # shock liver: The patient
s LFTs continue to be elevated, likely due
   to hypoperfusion in setting of prolonged hypotension.  The elevated T
   bili is likely in part from hemolytic anemia, but massive elevations in
   all liver enzymes c/w shock liver.
   - continue to trend.
   - Elevated CKs and LFTs could also be concerning for rhabdo in the
   setting of ARF.  IVF with bicarb for alkalization of her urine given a
   possibility of rhabdo.
   # Hypernatremia: 150 this morning, likely [**2-27**] to aggressive fluids with
   sodium bicarb
   - will give D5 for free water replacement though will still need bicarb
   given likely rhabo
   - pm lytes, trend
   # DM2:  Sugar 47 overnight, got 1 amp D50 with good result, has been
   off insulin drip since yesterday
   - monitor sugars, may need insulin gtt
   # Access: femoral line; will need to change to SC/IJ when able. A line
   placed.  Will need CVVH line
 renal to place.
   # FEN: Nutrition c/s for tubefeeds, replete lytes prn, fluids as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease, who presented with respiratory and cardiac arrests. He was found to have hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is currently experiencing persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors, shock (possibly septic, cardiogenic, or distributive), metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure with mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, unresponsiveness (improving), hemolytic anemia superimposed on aplastic anemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient may be experiencing septic shock due to an infectious etiology, as evidenced by the improvement in status with aggressive fluids and antibiotics. However, the exact nature of the shock is unclear.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely secondary to overwhelming sepsis and renal failure. This requires monitoring of pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2 and serial ABG and electrolytes to monitor.
3. Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: The cause of the respiratory failure and acidosis is unclear. Extensive cardiac history suggests a possible cardiac arrest, but perfusing blood pressure and good oxygenation make pulmonary"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory
   and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure,
   and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, but he has had
   worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte
   disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with
   spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of EMS now
   admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors.
   Course complicated by DIC, anemia, hemolysis and MOSF.
   # Shock: Pt was adequately fluid resuscitated but still requiring
   levophed for bp support.  Likely combination of cardiogenic and septic
   shock; although no clear source currently.  Receiving multiple
   transfusions for pancytopenia; likely from underlying MDS but unclear
   cause for acute hemolysis.  MOSF currently worsening with coagulopathy
   and fulminant hepatic failure; also cardiac ischemia with troponin of
   2.6.
   - continue IV antibiotics with vanc and cefepime; also neutropenic
   - pressors as needed for pressure support
 on levophed
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - tranfuse for goal hct>30
   - Monitor pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2
   - holding on CT at this point given unstable nature of patient
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely [**2-27**] overwhelming sepsis, renal failure.
   pH low but bicarb normalizing; Had been on IV barcarb for > 24 hours
   now.  Renal aware and no indication for CVVH at this point.
   - serial ABG
s and lytes to monitor
   - abx as above
   - renal following , appreciate recs
   - stop bicarb infusion as bicarb now normalizing.
   # Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: Unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac
   history suggests cardiac arrest as well as his positive cardiac
   enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood pressure per EMS in the field. PE
   is less likely at a gas shortly after intubation showed good
   oxygenation.   PNA less likely as CXR does not suggest it.  Have been
   able to wean down PEEP and decrease FiO2 ro 40%.  Last gas:
   7.4/30/191/19 showing a mixed  respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - has been off sedation
   # Unresponsiveness:  Worse today as patient is less responsive and not
   waking to noxious stimuli.  Not able to obtain Head CT but high concern
   for ICH due to thrombocytopenia.  Also poor perfusion due to PEA or
   hypotension.
   - has been off sedation as above
   - continue to monitor and discuss with family his poor prognosis
   # DIC: Improved somewhat with FFP and platelets.  Heme does not think
   this is TTP.  Unclear etiology of DIC but patient with underlying
   aplastic anemia and now sepsis with MOSF
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - continue to transfusion platelets, FFP as needed
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 30, given concern for myocardial
   ischemia
   - heme following, appreciate recs.
   # CAD: Pt with extensive CAD history, including prior
   revascularizations and recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital
   arrest, although he had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG had signs of
   hyperkalemia on arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after
   resolution of hyperK suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin
   positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or
   secondary to brief circulatory collapse followed by return of
   circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that spontaneously
   terminated.  Enzymes trending up likely multifactorial from end organ
   ischemia and renal failure.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF: Known EF 15-20%
   - echo ordered  to eval for new WMA
   - No ACE-I or B-blocker given hypotension.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists, now doubled in the 4
s on admission now stable at 4.9
   this morning  Differential includes ATN from hypotension, TTP, other
   intrarenal causes.  Less likely prerenal or postrenal given his other
   issues.  Osm gap was elevated at 13.  FENA of 0.4 suggests prerenal,
   but given the extent of his hypotension and rise in his Cr, more likely
   to be ATN.
   - pending cyclosporin level (pt may have been taking CSA even though
   directed not to)
   - continue volume resuscitation as above with D5 and NS
   - serial electrolytes
   - renal following, appreciate recs, consider CVVH
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # shock liver: The patient
s LFTs continue to be elevated, likely due
   to hypoperfusion in setting of prolonged hypotension.  The elevated T
   bili is likely in part from hemolytic anemia, but massive elevations in
   all liver enzymes c/w shock liver.
   - continue to trend and provide supportive care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and now presenting with severe sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemolytic anemia, myocardial ischemia, and multiorgan failure (MOSF).

The patient's current condition includes persistent hypotension requiring multiple vasopressors, worsening renal function, electrolyte disturbances, coagulopathy, and fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's respiratory failure and metabolic acidosis are also present, with a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis on ABG analysis. The patient is unresponsive and not waking to noxious stimuli, raising concerns for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) due to thrombocytopenia. 

The patient has a history of extensive CAD with prior revascularizations and recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's cardiac troponin level is positive, indicating myocardial ischemia. The patient's CHF is known, with an ejection fraction of 15-20%.

The patient's renal failure is acute on chronic, with Cr levels doubled since admission. The differential includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), thrombotic thromb"

   OBTUNDATION -- Improving. Received minimal sedation in ED, but not
   responding to sternal rub on arrival in ICU. coagulopathy creates high
   risk for bleeding.  Could also be due to seizure activity if a bleed is
   present.  Also could have hypoxic encephalopathy as it was unclear how
   well he was oxygenating when he was found.  He had a Utox which was
   negative, but substances should be consider as a cause of mental status
   change.   He is now moving all 4 extremities, withdraws to pain and

   CAD/ ICM --
   # CAD: Pt with extensive CAD history, including prior
   revascularizations and recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital
   arrest, although he had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG had signs of
   hyperkalemia on arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after
   resolution of hyperK suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin
   positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or
   secondary to brief circulatory collapse followed by return of
   circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that spontaneously
   terminated.  Enzymes trending up likely multifactorial from end organ
   ischemia and renal failure.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient. These include:

1. Presumed septic shock with multi-organ failure: The patient is currently on pressor support and has respiratory, cardiac, renal, hepatic, marrow, and neurologic dysfunction. This suggests a severe systemic infection leading to shock and failure of multiple organs.

2. Possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has an elevated D-dimer level and low platelet count, which are indicative of DIC. This condition can lead to bleeding and clotting abnormalities throughout the body.

3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. This indicates severe impairment in oxygenation and ventilation.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a rising creatinine level, suggesting an acute deterioration in renal function on top of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. This may be due to factors such as acute tubular necrosis, toxic injury, or prerenal causes.

5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (15-20%). There is concern for ongoing myocardial ischemia and possible arrhythmias.

6. Obitundation: The patient is showing signs of decreased mental status, possibly due to factors such as coagul"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The bicarb gtt was stopped.
   - Ca acetate was started per renal.
   - Vanc level ordered for t/m, need to give 1 mg for a level < 15.
   - Heme/onc recs were to scan his head/torso if possible and he was sent
   for these as his BPs stabilized.  Head CT showed no bleed, multifocal
   areas of hypodensity which may represent chronic vs acute infarct.
   Also rec additional tests which were sent: lupus anticoagulant,
   anticardiolipin antibody, EBV PCR, CMV VL.
   - TTE showed: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with akinesis of the inferior, infero-lateral,
   distal LV/apical segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
   - Started on an insulin gtt for elevated BS in the 200's to 300's.
   - Lactate decrease from 7.9 to 6.7 over the day.
   - Patient was off levophed for an hour overnight and then went into
   a.fib with RVR with HRs in the 140s.  Was given IV metoprolol 5 mg x 3
   and his pressures dropped so levophed had to be restarted.  Still was
   in the 130s.  Was given IV dilt 10 mg x 2 with some response and 30 mg
   of po dilt, however he continued to range from the 120's to the high
   130's.  He was then loaded with dixogen 0.25 mg q8h x 3.  He was then
   switched from levophed to neo and given a 500 cc NS bolus.  He remained
   tachycardic in the 120's to the 140's so he was started on an
   amiodarone gtt with a bolus of 150 mg IV amiodarone.  He remained
   tachycardic and his family was updated.  He received another 500 cc NS
   bolus.
   - His SBP remained low and he was on max levels of neo.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory
   and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure,
   and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, but he has had
   worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte
   disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with
   spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of EMS now
   admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors.
   Course complicated by DIC, anemia, hemolysis and MOSF.
   # Shock: Pt was adequately fluid resuscitated but still requiring
   levophed for bp support.  Likely combination of cardiogenic and septic
   shock; although no clear source currently.  Receiving multiple
   transfusions for pancytopenia; likely from underlying MDS but unclear
   cause for acute hemolysis.  MOSF currently worsening with coagulopathy
   and fulminant hepatic failure; also cardiac ischemia with troponin of
   2.6.
   - continue IV antibiotics with vanc and cefepime; also neutropenic
   - pressors as needed for pressure support
 on levophed
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - tranfuse for goal hct>30
   - Monitor pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2
   - holding on CT at this point given unstable nature of patient
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely [**2-27**] overwhelming sepsis, renal failure.
   pH low but bicarb normalizing; Had been on IV barcarb for > 24 hours
   now.  Renal aware and no indication for CVVH at this point.
   - serial ABG
s and lytes to monitor
   - abx as above
   - renal following , appreciate recs
   - stop bicarb infusion as bicarb now normalizing.
   # Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: Unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac
   history suggests cardiac arrest as well as his positive cardiac
   enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood pressure per EMS in the field. PE
   is less likely at a gas shortly after intubation showed good
   oxygenation.   PNA less likely as CXR does not suggest it.  Have been
   able to wean down PEEP and decrease FiO2 ro 40%.  Last gas:
   7.4/30/191/19 showing a mixed  respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - has been off sedation
   # Unresponsiveness:  Worse today as patient is less responsive and not
   waking to noxious stimuli.  Not able to obtain Head CT but high concern
   for ICH due to thrombocytopenia.  Also poor perfusion due to PEA or
   hypotension.
   - has been off sedation as above
   - continue to monitor and discuss with family his poor prognosis
   # DIC: Improved somewhat with FFP and platelets.  Heme does not think
   this is TTP.  Unclear etiology of DIC but patient with underlying
   aplastic anemia and now sepsis with MOSF
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - continue to transfusion platelets, FFP as needed
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 30, given concern for myocardial
   ischemia
   - heme following, appreciate recs.
   # CAD: Pt with extensive CAD history, including prior
   revascularizations and recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital
   arrest, although he had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG had signs of
   hyperkalemia on arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after
   resolution of hyperK suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin
   positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or
   secondary to brief circulatory collapse followed by return of
   circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that spontaneously
   terminated.  Enzymes trending up likely multifactorial from end organ
   ischemia and renal failure.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF: Known EF 15-20%
   - echo ordered  to eval for new WMA
   - No ACE-I or B-blocker given hypotension.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists, now doubled in the 4
s on admission now stable at 4.9
   this morning  Differential includes ATN from hypotension, TTP, other
   intrarenal causes.  Less likely prerenal or postrenal given his other
   issues.  Osm gap was elevated at 13.  FENA of 0.4 suggests prerenal,
   but given the extent of his hypotension and rise in his Cr, more likely
   to be ATN.
   - pending cyclosporin level (pt may have been taking CSA even though
   directed not to)
   - continue volume resuscitation as above with D5 and NS
   - serial electrolytes
   - renal following, appreciate recs, consider CVVH
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # shock liver: The patient
s LFTs continue to be elevated, likely due
   to hypoperfusion in setting of prolonged hypotension.  The elevated T
   bili is likely in part from hemolytic anemia, but massive elevations in
   all liver enzymes c/w shock liver.
   - continue to trend and provide supportive care
   .
   # Access: femoral line; not able to resite due to coagulopathy and
   thrombocytopenia.  A-line was lost yesterday.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease, and recent respiratory and cardiac arrests. He is currently admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors. The patient's condition is complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, hemolysis, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MOSF).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic and septic shock due to poor perfusion and hypotension. He requires continuous pressor support.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to overwhelming sepsis and renal failure. Close monitoring of pH and electrolytes is necessary.

3. Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: The cause of the patient's respiratory failure and mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis is unclear. Ventilator support is required, and efforts should be made to wean off sedation.

4. Unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness is worsening, and there is a high concern for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) due to thrombocytopenia and poor perfusion.

5. DIC: The patient has improved somewhat with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet transfusions. The etiology of DIC is unclear, but it may be related to sepsis"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The bicarb gtt was stopped.
   - Ca acetate was started per renal.
   - Vanc level ordered for t/m, need to give 1 mg for a level < 15.
   - Heme/onc recs were to scan his head/torso if possible and he was sent
   for these as his BPs stabilized.  Head CT showed no bleed, multifocal
   areas of hypodensity which may represent chronic vs acute infarct.
   Also rec additional tests which were sent: lupus anticoagulant,
   anticardiolipin antibody, EBV PCR, CMV VL.
   - TTE showed: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with akinesis of the inferior, infero-lateral,
   distal LV/apical segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
   - Started on an insulin gtt for elevated BS in the 200's to 300's.
   - Lactate decrease from 7.9 to 6.7 over the day.
   - Patient was off levophed for an hour overnight and then went into
   a.fib with RVR with HRs in the 140s.  Was given IV metoprolol 5 mg x 3
   and his pressures dropped so levophed had to be restarted.  Still was
   in the 130s.  Was given IV dilt 10 mg x 2 with some response and 30 mg
   of po dilt, however he continued to range from the 120's to the high
   130's.  He was then loaded with dixogen 0.25 mg q8h x 3.  He was then
   switched from levophed to neo and given a 500 cc NS bolus.  He remained
   tachycardic in the 120's to the 140's so he was started on an
   amiodarone gtt with a bolus of 150 mg IV amiodarone.  He remained
   tachycardic and his family was updated.  He received another 500 cc NS
   bolus.
   - His SBP remained low and he was on max levels of neo.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory
   and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure,
   and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, but he has had
   worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte
   disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with
   spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of EMS now
   admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors.
   Course complicated by DIC, anemia, hemolysis and multiogran system
   failure.  Now s/p afib with RVR and persistent hypotension overnight.
   # Shock/Episode of A.fib with RVR overnight: Patient was doing better
   and had been weaned off pressors for an hour when he had an episode of
   a.fib with RVR.  He was given 5 mg IV metoprolol x 3 and his pressures
   dropped and levophed was added back on for pressure support.  He was
   additionally given fluid boluses, diltiazem 10 mg IV x2, digoxin
   loaded, and started on an amiodarone gtt, however his HR remained in
   the 120
s to 130
s and his pressure continued to decline until they
   were unreadable.  The levophed was stopped during this time given his
   tachycardia and he was started on neo which was uptitrated to maximal
   doses without response.  The patient
s family was called multiple times
   during the night and updated on his status and are here this morning
   with him.  They understand that his prognosis is very poor as his
   pressure is so low and unresponsive to pressors.  Also of note his head
   CT which was obtained last night showed multiple episodes of
   hypodensities They are currently awaiting his outpatient oncologist,
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3784**]
s arrival before making further decisions.
   - Will continue to support his as we have been doing as below while the
   family takes the time they need to make a decision and speak with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3784**].
   # Shock: Pt was adequately fluid resuscitated but still requiring
   levophed for bp support.  Likely combination of cardiogenic and septic
   shock; although no clear source currently.  Receiving multiple
   transfusions for pancytopenia; likely from underlying MDS but unclear
   cause for acute hemolysis.  MOSF currently worsening with coagulopathy
   and fulminant hepatic failure; also cardiac ischemia with troponin of
   2.6.  Continued hypotension as above.
   - continue IV antibiotics with vanc and cefepime; also neutropenic
   - pressors as needed for pressure support
 on neo
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - tranfuse for goal hct>30
   - Monitor pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely [**2-27**] overwhelming sepsis, renal failure.
   pH low but bicarb normalizing; Had been on IV barcarb for > 24 hours
   now.  Renal aware and no indication for CVVH at this point.
   - serial ABG
s and lytes to monitor
   - abx as above
   - renal following , appreciate recs
   - stop bicarb infusion as bicarb now normalizing.
   # Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: Unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac
   history suggests cardiac arrest as well as his positive cardiac
   enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood pressure per EMS in the field. PE
   is less likely at a gas shortly after intubation showed good
   oxygenation.   PNA less likely as CXR does not suggest it.  Have been
   able to wean down PEEP and decrease FiO2 ro 40%.  Last gas:
   7.4/30/191/19 showing a mixed  respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - has been off sedation
   # Unresponsiveness:  Worse today as patient is less responsive and not
   waking to noxious stimuli.  Not able to obtain Head CT but high concern
   for ICH due to thrombocytopenia.  Also poor perfusion due to PEA or
   hypotension.
   - has been off sedation as above
   - continue to monitor and discuss with family his poor prognosis
   # DIC: Improved somewhat with FFP and platelets.  Heme does not think
   this is TTP.  Unclear etiology of DIC but patient with underlying
   aplastic anemia and now sepsis with MOSF
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - continue to transfusion platelets, FFP as needed
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia. Hct 30.8 this am
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 30, given concern for myocardial
   ischemia
   - heme following, appreciate recs.
   # CAD: Pt with extensive CAD history, including prior
   revascularizations and recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital
   arrest, although he had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG had signs of
   hyperkalemia on arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after
   resolution of hyperK suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin
   positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or
   secondary to brief circulatory collapse followed by return of
   circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that spontaneously
   terminated.  Enzymes trending up likely multifactorial from end organ
   ischemia and renal failure.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF: Known EF 15-20%
   - echo ordered  to eval for new WMA
   - No ACE-I or B-blocker given hypotension.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists, now doubled in the 4
s on admission now stable at 4.9
   this morning  Differential includes ATN from hypotension, TTP, other
   intrarenal causes.  Less likely prerenal or postrenal given his other
   issues.  Osm gap was elevated at 13.  FENA of 0.4 suggests prerenal,
   but given the extent of his hypotension and rise in his Cr, more likely
   to be ATN.
   - continue volume resuscitation as above with D5 and NS
   - serial electrolytes
   - renal following, appreciate recs,
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # shock liver: The patient
s LFTs continue to be elevated, likely due
   to hypoperfusion in setting of prolonged hypotension.  The elevated T
   bili is likely in part from hemolytic anemia, but massive elevations in
   all liver enzymes c/w shock liver.
   - continue to trend and provide supportive care
   .
   # Access: femoral line; not able to resite due to coagulopathy and
   thrombocytopenia.  A-line was lost.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease, who presented with respiratory and cardiac arrests. The patient has been in the ICU since then and is currently on multiple pressors for persistent hypotension. The patient's condition is complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, hemolysis, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and shock. The patient's prognosis is very poor due to unresponsive hypotension despite maximal doses of vasopressors.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's bicarb gtt was stopped, and Ca acetate was started per renal.
- Vanc level ordered for t/m, need to give 1 mg for a level < 15.
- Heme/onc recs were to scan his head/torso if possible and he was sent for these as his BPs stabilized. Head CT showed no bleed, multifocal areas of hypodensity which may represent chronic vs acute infarct. Also rec additional tests which were sent: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, EBV PCR, CMV VL.
- TTE showed: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with akinesis of the inferior, infero-lateral, distal LV/apical segments. T"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The bicarb gtt was stopped.
   - Ca acetate was started per renal.
   - Vanc level ordered for t/m, need to give 1 mg for a level < 15.
   - Heme/onc recs were to scan his head/torso if possible and he was sent
   for these as his BPs stabilized.  Head CT showed no bleed, multifocal
   areas of hypodensity which may represent chronic vs acute infarct.
   Also rec additional tests which were sent: lupus anticoagulant,
   anticardiolipin antibody, EBV PCR, CMV VL.
   - TTE showed: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with akinesis of the inferior, infero-lateral,
   distal LV/apical segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
   - Started on an insulin gtt for elevated BS in the 200's to 300's.
   - Lactate decrease from 7.9 to 6.7 over the day.
   - Patient was off levophed for an hour overnight and then went into
   a.fib with RVR with HRs in the 140s.  Was given IV metoprolol 5 mg x 3
   and his pressures dropped so levophed had to be restarted.  Still was
   in the 130s.  Was given IV dilt 10 mg x 2 with some response and 30 mg
   of po dilt, however he continued to range from the 120's to the high
   130's.  He was then loaded with dixogen 0.25 mg q8h x 3.  He was then
   switched from levophed to neo and given a 500 cc NS bolus.  He remained
   tachycardic in the 120's to the 140's so he was started on an
   amiodarone gtt with a bolus of 150 mg IV amiodarone.  He remained
   tachycardic and his family was updated.  He received another 500 cc NS
   bolus.
   - His SBP remained low and he was on max levels of neo.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory and cardiac arrests, with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is currently in shock and has a poor prognosis. He requires support for respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, unresponsiveness, DIC, hemolytic anemia, CAD, CHF, acute on chronic renal failure, and shock liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a low pH and bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic acidosis, which may be due to overwhelming sepsis and renal failure.
3. Unresponsiveness: The patient's level of consciousness is worsening, and he is less responsive to noxious stimuli. This could be attributed to poor perfusion, hypotension, and the presence of multiple infarcts on head CT.
4. DIC: The patient has developed DIC, which is characterized by widespread activation of coagulation pathways. This can lead to bleeding and organ dysfunction.
5. Hemolytic Anemia: The patient has hemoly"

   - The bicarb gtt was stopped.
   - Ca acetate was started per renal.
   - Vanc level ordered for t/m, need to give 1 mg for a level < 15.
   - Heme/onc recs were to scan his head/torso if possible and he was sent
   for these as his BPs stabilized.  Head CT showed no bleed, multifocal
   areas of hypodensity which may represent chronic vs acute infarct.
   Also rec additional tests which were sent: lupus anticoagulant,
   anticardiolipin antibody, EBV PCR, CMV VL.
   - TTE showed: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with akinesis of the inferior, infero-lateral,
   distal LV/apical segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
   - Started on an insulin gtt for elevated BS in the 200's to 300's.
   - Lactate decrease from 7.9 to 6.7 over the day.
   - Patient was off levophed for an hour overnight and then went into

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory
   and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure,
   and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, but he has had
   worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte
   disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with
   spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of EMS now
   admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors.
   Course complicated by DIC, anemia, hemolysis and MOSF.
   # Shock: Pt was adequately fluid resuscitated but still requiring
   levophed for bp support.  Likely combination of cardiogenic and septic
   shock; although no clear source currently.  Receiving multiple
   transfusions for pancytopenia; likely from underlying MDS but unclear
   cause for acute hemolysis.  MOSF currently worsening with coagulopathy
   and fulminant hepatic failure; also cardiac ischemia with troponin of
   2.6.
   - continue IV antibiotics with vanc and cefepime; also neutropenic
   - pressors as needed for pressure support
 on levophed
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - tranfuse for goal hct>30
   - Monitor pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2
   - holding on CT at this point given unstable nature of patient
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely [**2-27**] overwhelming sepsis, renal failure.
   pH low but bicarb normalizing; Had been on IV barcarb for > 24 hours
   now.  Renal aware and no indication for CVVH at this point.
   - serial ABG
s and lytes to monitor
   - abx as above
   - renal following , appreciate recs
   - stop bicarb infusion as bicarb now normalizing.
   # Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: Unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac
   history suggests cardiac arrest as well as his positive cardiac
   enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood pressure per EMS in the field. PE
   is less likely at a gas shortly after intubation showed good
   oxygenation.   PNA less likely as CXR does not suggest it.  Have been
   able to wean down PEEP and decrease FiO2 ro 40%.  Last gas:
   7.4/30/191/19 showing a mixed  respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - has been off sedation
   # Unresponsiveness:  Worse today as patient is less responsive and not
   waking to noxious stimuli.  Not able to obtain Head CT but high concern
   for ICH due to thrombocytopenia.  Also poor perfusion due to PEA or
   hypotension.
   - has been off sedation as above
   - continue to monitor and discuss with family his poor prognosis
   # DIC: Improved somewhat with FFP and platelets.  Heme does not think
   this is TTP.  Unclear etiology of DIC but patient with underlying
   aplastic anemia and now sepsis with MOSF
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - continue to transfusion platelets, FFP as needed
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with DM2, CAD, CHF, aplastic anemia, CKD, now with s/p respiratory
   and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure,
   and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, but he has had
   worsening renal function over the past week, leading to electrolyte
   disturbances and possibly an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with
   spontaneous return of circulation prior to the arrival of EMS now
   admitted with persistent hypotension requiring multiple pressors.
   Course complicated by DIC, anemia, hemolysis and MOSF.
   # Shock: Pt was adequately fluid resuscitated but still requiring
   levophed for bp support.  Likely combination of cardiogenic and septic
   shock; although no clear source currently.  Receiving multiple
   transfusions for pancytopenia; likely from underlying MDS but unclear
   cause for acute hemolysis.  MOSF currently worsening with coagulopathy
   and fulminant hepatic failure; also cardiac ischemia with troponin of
   2.6.
   - continue IV antibiotics with vanc and cefepime; also neutropenic
   - pressors as needed for pressure support
 on levophed
   - Goal MAP >60.
   - tranfuse for goal hct>30
   - Monitor pH on ABG for a goal pH of > 7.2
   - holding on CT at this point given unstable nature of patient
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely [**2-27**] overwhelming sepsis, renal failure.
   pH low but bicarb normalizing; Had been on IV barcarb for > 24 hours
   now.  Renal aware and no indication for CVVH at this point.
   - serial ABG
s and lytes to monitor
   - abx as above
   - renal following , appreciate recs
   - stop bicarb infusion as bicarb now normalizing.
   # Respiratory Failure/Acidosis: Unclear precipitant. extensive cardiac
   history suggests cardiac arrest as well as his positive cardiac
   enzymes, but pt had perfusing blood pressure per EMS in the field. PE
   is less likely at a gas shortly after intubation showed good
   oxygenation.   PNA less likely as CXR does not suggest it.  Have been
   able to wean down PEEP and decrease FiO2 ro 40%.  Last gas:
   7.4/30/191/19 showing a mixed  respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   - vent support, can try to wean O2 as tolerated with a goal oxygenation
   of 90% of higher.
   - has been off sedation
   # Unresponsiveness:  Worse today as patient is less responsive and not
   waking to noxious stimuli.  Not able to obtain Head CT but high concern
   for ICH due to thrombocytopenia.  Also poor perfusion due to PEA or
   hypotension.
   - has been off sedation as above
   - continue to monitor and discuss with family his poor prognosis
   # DIC: Improved somewhat with FFP and platelets.  Heme does not think
   this is TTP.  Unclear etiology of DIC but patient with underlying
   aplastic anemia and now sepsis with MOSF
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - continue to transfusion platelets, FFP as needed
   # Hemolytic anemia superimposed on Aplastic anemia:
   - supportive transfusion to goal Hct 30, given concern for myocardial
   ischemia
   - heme following, appreciate recs.
   # CAD: Pt with extensive CAD history, including prior
   revascularizations and recent NSTEMI, with unwitnessed, out of hospital
   arrest, although he had a perfusing BP in the field. EKG had signs of
   hyperkalemia on arrival but pseudonormalization in ant leads after
   resolution of hyperK suggests ischemic insult. Cardiac troponin
   positive, rules in for NSTEMI, which may have been primary event or
   secondary to brief circulatory collapse followed by return of
   circulation, as would be the case with VT/VF that spontaneously
   terminated.  Enzymes trending up likely multifactorial from end organ
   ischemia and renal failure.
   - trend enzymes, daily EKG
   - anticoagulants, antiplatelets contraindicated [**2-27**] DIC
   - statin contraindicated [**2-27**] shock liver
   # CHF: Known EF 15-20%
   - echo ordered  to eval for new WMA
   - No ACE-I or B-blocker given hypotension.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr had been trending up at last
   clinic vists, now doubled in the 4
s on admission now stable at 4.9
   this morning  Differential includes ATN from hypotension, TTP, other
   intrarenal causes.  Less likely prerenal or postrenal given his other
   issues.  Osm gap was elevated at 13.  FENA of 0.4 suggests prerenal,
   but given the extent of his hypotension and rise in his Cr, more likely
   to be ATN.
   - pending cyclosporin level (pt may have been taking CSA even though
   directed not to)
   - continue volume resuscitation as above with D5 and NS
   - serial electrolytes
   - renal following, appreciate recs, consider CVVH
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # shock liver: The patient
s LFTs continue to be elevated, likely due
   to hypoperfusion in setting of prolonged hypotension.  The elevated T
   bili is likely in part from hemolytic anemia, but massive elevations in
   all liver enzymes c/w shock liver.
   - continue to trend and provide supportive care
   .
   # Access: femoral line; not able to resite due to coagulopathy and
   thrombocytopenia.  A-line was lost yesterday.
   # FEN: TFs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aplastic anemia, chronic kidney disease, who presented to the ICU after experiencing a respiratory and cardiac arrest. The patient has been hypotensive and required multiple pressors for blood pressure support. He also has a history of hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemolysis, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MOSF).

The patient's current condition includes shock, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure/acidosis, unresponsiveness, DIC, hemolytic anemia superimposed on aplastic anemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure of 33 cmH2O and a plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 133 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%.

Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient is in shock, likely due to a combination of cardiogenic and septic causes. He requires ongoing pressor support.
2. Metabolic Acidosis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is described as critically ill with presumed septic shock and multi-organ failure. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension (SBP in the 30s), tachypnea (RR of 30 breaths per minute), and fever (Tmax of 38.2 C). The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation with a PCV+Assist mode.

The lab results show abnormal values across various parameters, including leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels indicating cardiac injury, and abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST). Imaging studies reveal extensive nonspecific hypodensities on the head CT, suggestive of acute or subacute ischemic changes, and bibasilar infiltrates on the chest CT.

The patient has been receiving multiple pressor medications, including levophed, to maintain blood pressure. The patient's condition is being closely monitored with frequent assessment of lactate levels and SvO2 to guide fluid resuscitation and volume expansion.

The patient's prognosis is described as grim, and discussions about changing the goals of care to comfort measures only (CMO) have been initiated with the family. The patient currently remains on life support and is under constant monitoring in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and experiencing presumed septic shock with multi-organ failure. The patient is pressor-dependent on levophed and has respiratory, cardiac, renal, hepatic, marrow, and neurological dysfunction. The prognosis is grim, and the healthcare team is considering changing the goals of care to comfort measures only (CMO) due to the patient's poor condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to septic shock, making them susceptible to further infections.

2. Organ failure: The patient is already experiencing multi-organ failure, which may continue to progress if not managed appropriately.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further, leading to increased difficulty in breathing and potential respiratory failure.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient's cardiac function is affected, and there is a risk of worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.

5. Renal impairment: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to potential kidney failure and electrolyte imbalances.

6. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function is impaired, which can affect metabolism and detoxification processes.

7. Marrow suppression: The patient's bone marrow function is affected, leading to decreased production of blood cells.

8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological function may continue to decline, resulting in cognitive deficits or even coma.
