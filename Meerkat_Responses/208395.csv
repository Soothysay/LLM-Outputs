   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of HTN, DM, b/l PE, pulm HTN, dCHF who
   was initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia.  OSH course
   complicated by difficulty weaning from vent as well as atrial flutter
   with RVR now s/p cardioversion.  Patient transfer to [**Hospital1 **] for further
   work up of SOB.
   .
   # SOB:  Patient with multiple reasons to be short of breath including
   but not limited to pulmonary HTN, PE, volume overload, dCHF, COPD or
   pneumonia.  In the setting of a recent surgery, likely volume
   overload.  Edematous on exam (not baseline per patient), reports takes
   80mg PO lasix at home but has only received 20mg PO lasix post-op.
   Patient also with fever, WBC elevation and questionable infiltrate on
   CXR making pneumonia a concern. PE less likely (adequately
   anticoagulated). COPD less likely (history unclear, ABG not
   supportive). On right heart catheterization [**7-/2143**] to close a patent
   PFO, patient was noted to have a RVEDP of 16mmHg and pulmonary artery
   pressures of 65/30 and 47 (s/d/m).  He was started on sildenafil at OSH
   although he has yet to follow up with a pulmonologist.
   - Continue IV lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], goal -2L qd; consider gtt if unable to
   tolerate [**2-4**] BPs
   - F/u final read of CXR
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - Follow up culture data
   - Obtain blood culture x2
   - Continue high flow oxygen overnight; consider BiPAP, ABG if
   desaturation
   - Consider CTA if not improving with diuresis
   - Upload OSH images
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Obtain echo cardiogram to assess for worsening pulmonary HTN once
   diuresed
   .
   # Pulmonary HTN: New diagnosis.  Question if secondary to chronic PEs
   of unknown origin vs idiopathic.  Patient was noted to have pulmonary
   HTN on right heart cath that was done for PFO closure.  Currently on
   sildenafil for treatment and has not yet been seen by pulmonologist as
   outpatient.  It is a potential etiology of patient
s SOB.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Continue SOB treatment per above
   - Needs outpatient pulmonology f/u
   - Obtain echo cardiogram to assess for worsening pulmonary HTN once
   diuresed
   .
   # Chronic PEs: Unclear etiology, questionable secondary to stasis with
   pulmonary HTN.  Patient was supposed to have hypercoagulable work up in
   past.  No evidence of new clots since his PFO closed.  Currently
   patient remains on hep gtt and plavix.  Per medical records, he had a
   clot while on therapeutic dose of coumadin and so presumably plavix was
   added.
   - Continue anticoagulation with hep gtt and plavix
   - Upload OSH images
   - Consider CTA if not improving with diuresis
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely [**2-4**] infection. Questionable infiltrate on
   CXR; also s/p abdominal recent surgery. At this time treating broadly
   for infection and covering for HAP given desats and possible infiltrate
   on CXR.
   - F/u final read of CXR
   - F/u culture data
   - Consider CT abdomen if leukocytosis not resolving
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP
   .
   # Elevated ALT: [**Month (only) 11**] represent viral hepatitis although in the setting
   of volume overload likely is mild congestive hepatopathy.
   - Trend ALT
   - Consider checking hepatitis serologies if not improving
   .
   # Anemia: 29.1 from 40.3 last [**Month (only) 93**]. Likely related to prolonged
   hospital stay and recent surgery.  Given anticoagulation GI bleed
   certainly a concern.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal hct > 21 or unstable
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin SS for now.  Can change to outpatient regimen when
   closer to discharge.
   .
   # Med rec: Unclear why patient is on digoxin.  Presumably rate control
   with sotalol for rhythm control in a-flutter or possible also treatment
   of pulmonary HTN.  Unclear if patient will need these medications in
   the long term as flutter occurred in the peri-op setting.
   .
   # h/o a-flutter: s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   .
   # Strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.  Daily
   dressing changes.
   - Continue to follow
   - Serial abdominal exam
   .
   # GERD: continue PPI
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Zocor acutely, can restart when closer to

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, bilateral pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and decompensated congestive heart failure.
- He was admitted initially for a strangulated hernia and experienced difficulties weaning from the ventilator as well as atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, which was cardioverted.
- The patient has been transferred to [Hospital1] for further evaluation of shortness of breath.
- He is alert and oriented, but experiencing crackles in both lung bases.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 101/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.
- The patient has a history of recent surgery and is suspected to have volume overload, leading to edema on examination.
- He reports taking 80 mg of oral lasix at home but has only received 20 mg post-op.
- There is a concern for pneumonia due to fever, white blood cell elevation, and a questionable infiltrate on the chest X-ray.
- The patient also has elevated pulmonary artery pressures on right heart catheterization.
- He is currently being treated with sildenafil, high flow oxygen, and intravenous lasix.
- The plan includes continuing IV lasix, obtaining a final read of the chest X-ray, following"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, bilateral pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure. The patient was initially admitted for a strangulated hernia but developed difficulty weaning from the ventilator as well as atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, which was cardioverted.

The patient is currently in the ICU with shortness of breath and has multiple reasons for this symptom including pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, volume overload, dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pneumonia. The note suggests that the patient is likely experiencing volume overload due to recent surgery, and the edematous examination supports this.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, new pulmonary embolism, COPD exacerbation, heart failure exacerbation, and potential infection due to fever and leukocytosis.

To summarize, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a complex medical history and current symptoms of shortness of breath. He has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of his condition. The potential medical complications include worsening pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, new pulmonary embolism, COPD exacerbation, heart failure exacerbation, and potential infection."

   foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
   maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is
   dilated with borderline depressed free wall motion. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve

   # Pulmonary HTN: Severe, likely worsening from prior (diagnosed when
   right heart cath done for PFO closure). Unifying diagnosis unclear
   given PFO, craniofacial facies, hypercoagulability, developmental
   delay.
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level ([**1-8**] digoxin level 0.2)
   - Consider PAC with vasodilator trial if no improvement
   .
   # Chronic PEs: Unclear etiology, questionable secondary to stasis with
   pulmonary HTN. Plavix was added to regimen as he presumably had clot
   while on therapeutic dose of coumadin.
    Patient was supposed to have hypercoagulable work up in past.  No
   evidence of new clots since his PFO closed.  Currently patient remains
   on hep gtt and plavix.  Per medical records, he had a clot while on
   therapeutic dose of coumadin and so presumably plavix was added.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary hypertension, and dCHF. He is currently in the ICU for a strangulated hernia repair and has been experiencing hypoxemia, episodes of atrial flutter with right ventricular overload, and fever.

The patient's arterial line was placed at 02:46 PM. He received Lasix 80mg IV in the AM and his electrolytes are stable with repletion of potassium. HIV consent was signed but pending, and his Digoxin level is 0.2.

An ECHO with bubbles showed no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function (EF>75%), dilated right ventricular cavity with borderline depressed free wall motion, severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and structurally normal aortic and mitral valves with trivial regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

The patient has a small left pleural effusion, which may be present on his chest X-ray. He has leukocytosis and a questionable infiltrate on CXR with a history of productive cough, suggesting possible nosocomial pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has severe pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure (bNP 3000s).

The patient is being treated with Lasix gtt, high flow oxygen, sildenafil/heparin gtt for pulmonary hypertension, and empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP. His arterial line and blood cultures are pending, as well as further testing for HIV status, sputum culture, and abdominal imaging.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxemia, further episodes of atrial flutter, worsening pulmonary hypertension, development of new pulmonary embolism, and nosocomial pneumonia/VAP. The patient's elevated ALT may represent viral hepatitis or congestive hepatopathy. Anemia may be related to prolonged hospital stay, recent surgery, and serosanguinous leak from the wound. The patient's history of strangulated bowel requires monitoring for signs of bowel ischemia or perforation. The patient's history of atrial flutter requires ongoing monitoring of heart rhythm and potential adjustment of antiarrhythmic medications."

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension, and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He presents with ongoing hypoxemia and an episode of atrial flutter with right ventricular overload (RVR) that resolved post-cardioversion. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypoxemia/SOB: Likely due to volume overload post-surgery and possibly nosocomial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or severe pulmonary hypertension.
- Pulmonary hypertension: Severe and worsening, likely from prior PFO closure.
- Chronic PEs: Unclear etiology, possibly secondary to stasis with pulmonary hypertension.
- Fever/leukocytosis: Likely due to infection, possibly pulmonary in origin.
- Hypokalemia: Aggressively managed with potassium chloride repletion as needed.
- Elevated ALT: Downtrending, possibly viral hepatitis or congestive hepatopathy.
- Anemia: Likely related to prolonged hospital stay and recent surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound.
- h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.
- h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   .
   # Hypoexemia/SOB: [**Month (only) 11**] likely be [**2-4**] volume overload s/p surgery
   consistent with exam and not taking home dose lasix post-op. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   be [**2-4**] nosocomial pneumonia, VAP as patient also with low-grade fever,
   leukocytosis, questionable infiltrate on CXR with hx productive cough.
   Also may be related with severe pulmonary HTN, dCHF (bNP 3000s). New PE
   less likely (adequately anticoagulated). Likely related with a
   combination of the above.
   - Continue lasix gtt today with goal -1.5 to -2L
   - Continue IV diamox 500mg x1 in AM
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   - Follow up AM CXR; order CXR tomorrow AM
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 3)
   - Re-obtain sputum culture [**2-4**] to contamination x 2
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to follow up culture data
   - Continue high flow oxygen with plans for BiPAP, ABG if desaturation
   or intubation
   - Less likely to obtain CTA once able to tolerate prone position; if
   obtain, consider CTA of torso to also image abdomen)
   - Will need PICC line for access after resolution of fevers
   .
   # Pulmonary HTN: Stable, severe. Unifying diagnosis unclear given PFO,
   craniofacial facies, hypercoagulability, developmental delay.
   Appreciate recs from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10291**].
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level ([**1-8**] digoxin level 0.2, [**1-10**] digoxin
   level 0.5)
   - Consider PAC with vasodilator trial if no improvement
   - Obtain genetic karyotype and needs follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Chronic PEs: Unclear etiology, questionable secondary to stasis with
   pulmonary HTN. Plavix was added to regimen as he presumably had clot
   while on therapeutic dose of coumadin.  Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past.  No evidence of new clots since his
   PFO closed.  Currently patient remains on hep gtt and plavix.
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt and plavix
   - Less likely to obtain CTA once able to tolerate prone position; if
   obtain, consider CTA of torso to also image abdomen)
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely [**2-4**] infection with source likely to be
   pulmonary. Abdominal exam s/p surgery unremarkable.
   - Will need repeat sputum culture
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   - Follow up culture data
   - Consider CTA once able to tolerate prone position; if obtain,
   consider CTA of torso to also image abdomen)
   - Follow up HIV status (consent obtained and sent [**1-8**])
   - Continue serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   .
   # Elevated ALT: Downtrending, 98 today from 163. [**Month (only) 11**] represent viral
   hepatitis although in the setting of volume overload likely is mild
   congestive hepatopathy. Unlikely to need checking hepatitis serologies
   given improvement.
   - Continue to trend ALT
   .
   # Anemia: 27.5 down from 29.1 yesterday, (40.3 last [**Month (only) 93**]). Likely
   related to prolonged hospital stay and recent surgery with
   serosanguinous leak from wound.  Given anticoagulation, consider GI
   bleed.
   - Continue to guaiac all stools
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Continue serial abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   .
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level ([**1-8**] digoxin level 0.2, [**1-10**] digoxin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension (PHN), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He is currently admitted to the ICU for a strangulated hernia repair and is experiencing hypoexemia and volume overload.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 97/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow nebulization. His physical examination reveals crackles at the bases, regular rhythm with no murmurs, and surgical incision sites that are clean and intact.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.3, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, low potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Blood cultures are pending, and a chest X-ray has not been performed yet.

The patient's assessment and plan include several diagnoses and corresponding treatments:
1. Hypoexemia/SOB: The patient likely has volume overload secondary to surgery and may also have nosocomial pneumonia with low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and a questionable infiltrate on chest X-ray."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension (PHN), dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), and recent strangulated hernia repair. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypoxemia, suspected nosocomial pneumonia, volume overload, and worsening heart failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia/SOB: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to a combination of factors such as volume overload, nosocomial pneumonia, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Continued monitoring and management of oxygenation is necessary.

2. Pulmonary HTN: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart strain and failure. Continuous monitoring of the patient's pulmonary pressures and response to treatment is required. Consideration should be given to interventions such as sildenafil, heparin, and digoxin therapy, as well as a vasodilator trial if no improvement.

3. Chronic PEs: The patient has a history of recurrent pulmonary embolisms, and anticoagulation therapy should be continued to prevent further clot formation. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.

4. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection, most likely related to the pulmonary system. Repeat sputum cultures and continued empiric antibiotic coverage are warranted"

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension (PHN), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He is currently in the ICU for post-operative care after hernia repair surgery. The patient has been experiencing worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia, which could be due to volume overload, nosocomial pneumonia, or severe PHN. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.43, indicating normal acid-base balance. However, there are concerns about the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the patient's low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and questionable infiltrate on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/58 to 135/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nebulization. The patient appears more fatigued than yesterday but is alert and oriented. Physical examination reveals rales in the bases of the lungs, occasional wheezing, and a wide split S2 heart sound. The abdomen is soft with no acute distress or rebound tenderness. The patient has a midline surgical incision that is clean and intact, with serosanguinous drainage noted at the inferior incision site. Extremities show improved edema and"

   dCHF (bNP 3000s). New PE less likely (adequately anticoagulated).
   Likely related with a combination of the above.
   - Continue lasix gtt today with goal -1L
   - Continue IV diamox 500mg if alkalosis on PM lytes
   - Continue Heparin gtt.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB: Multifactorial as stated below. Continues to improve.
   Likely major contributors are pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema
   and likely infiltrate/infection. Also important to consider possible
   pulmonary emboli. [**Month (only) 11**] likely be [**2-4**] volume overload s/p surgery
   consistent with exam and not taking home dose lasix post-op. Further,
   [**2-4**] nosocomial pneumonia, VAP as patient also with low-grade fever,
   leukocytosis, questionable infiltrate on CXR with hx productive cough.
   Also may be related with severe pulmonary HTN, dCHF (bNP 3000s). New PE
   less likely (adequately anticoagulated). Likely related with a
   combination of the above.
   - CTA
   - NAC 600 mg x 4
   - Temporarily hold Lasix today after CTAContinue lasix gtt today with
   goal -1L
   - Continue Heparin gtt.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis); d/c lasix if Cr
   elevates
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 5)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue high flow oxygen, but wean today to 40%
   # Pulmonary HTN
   Stable, severe. Unifying diagnosis unclear given PFO, craniofacial
   facies, hypercoagulability, developmental delay. Likely secondary to
   PFO
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   # Genetic Syndrome
   Clear dysmorphic features and possibility of serious sequelae.
   Therefore send karyotype and on that basis determine if further
   outpatient workup is necessary.
   - Karyotype
   # Chronic PEs
   Unclear etiology, likely secondary and also exacerbating pulmonary HTN.
   Plavix was added to regimen as he presumably had clot while on
   therapeutic dose of coumadin. Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past, but this may be worth revisiting
   (again as an outpatient).  No evidence of new clots since his PFO
   closed. Currently patient remains on hep gtt (plavix stopped).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   # Fever/leukocytosis
   Both are improving. Likely because of antibiotic therapy. WBC now 11s
   and afebrile. Source likely pulmonary. No other findings suggestive of
   infection elsewhere.
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 3)
   - Follow up culture data
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia
   Near 30 and stable, (40.3 last [**Month (only) 93**]). Likely related to prolonged
   hospital stay and recent surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound.
   Now suppression likely given present infection. Given anticoagulation,
   consider GI bleed.
   - Guaiac stools again if suspicion of losses
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Now daily careful abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level ([**1-8**] digoxin level 0.2, [**1-10**] digoxin
   level 0.5)
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS with change to outpatient regimen when closer
   to discharge.
   # GERD: Continue PPI.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Zocor acutely, can restart when closer to
   discharge.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively as on digoxin, sotalol
   and lasix gtt, regular diabetic diet

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension (PHN), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have hypoxemia, likely due to a combination of factors including pulmonary edema, infection, and possible pulmonary emboli. The patient also has dysmorphic features and a possibility of a genetic syndrome. He has been diagnosed with chronic PEs, severe PHN, and anemia. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including heparin, lasix, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), sildenafil, digoxin, sotalol, and Plavix. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to experience low oxygen levels in the blood, which can lead to further respiratory distress and organ damage.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's history of recurrent PEs, there is a risk of new emboli forming, which can worsen his pulmonary hypertension and cause acute respiratory failure.
3. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible hospital-acquired infection, such as pneumonia. If left untreated, this could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has been aggressively"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary hypertension, and dilated cardiomyopathy. He is currently admitted to the ICU for post-operative care following strangulated hernia repair. The patient is experiencing shortness of breath, hypoxemia, volume overload, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and a questionable infiltrate on chest X-ray. He also has severe pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure. The patient is receiving various treatments including diuretics, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for pulmonary hypertension. His condition remains stable with some improvement in hypoxemia and volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and questionable infiltrate on chest X-ray may indicate the development of nosocomial pneumonia. Empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam is being provided.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Serial cultures and ABGs will be obtained to monitor for this complication.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of recurrent PEs and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. However, there is still a risk of DVT formation. Regular monitoring for signs of DVT is recommended.

   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB: Multifactorial as stated below. Continues to improve.
   Likely major contributors are pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema
   and likely infiltrate/infection. Also important to consider possible
   pulmonary emboli. [**Month (only) 11**] likely be [**2-4**] volume overload s/p surgery
   consistent with exam and not taking home dose lasix post-op. Further,
   [**2-4**] nosocomial pneumonia, VAP as patient also with low-grade fever,
   leukocytosis, questionable infiltrate on CXR with hx productive cough.
   Also may be related with severe pulmonary HTN, dCHF (bNP 3000s). New PE
   less likely (adequately anticoagulated). Likely related with a
   combination of the above.

   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 5)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue high flow oxygen, but wean today to 40%
   # Pulmonary HTN
   Stable, severe. Unifying diagnosis unclear given PFO, craniofacial
   facies, hypercoagulability, developmental delay. Likely secondary to
   PFO
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   # Genetic Syndrome
   Clear dysmorphic features and unusual
   # Chronic PEs: Unclear etiology, questionable secondary to stasis with
   pulmonary HTN. Plavix was added to regimen as he presumably had clot
   while on therapeutic dose of coumadin.  Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past.  No evidence of new clots since his
   PFO closed.  Currently patient remains on hep gtt and plavix.
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   - plavix stopoped
   - If worsens/ does not improve, consider CTA and CT abdomen
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely [**2-4**] infection with source likely to be
   pulmonary. Abdominal exam s/p surgery unremarkable.
   - Will need repeat sputum culture
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 3)
   - Follow up culture data
   - Follow up HIV status (consent obtained and sent [**1-8**])
   - Continue serial abdominal exams
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia: 30 and stable, (40.3 last [**Month (only) 93**]). Likely related to prolonged
   hospital stay and recent surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound.
   Given anticoagulation, consider GI bleed.
   - Continue to guaiac all stools

   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Continue serial abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level ([**1-8**] digoxin level 0.2, [**1-10**] digoxin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension, and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He is currently in the ICU for a strangulated hernia repair and is experiencing shortness of breath (SOB) with hypoxemia. The patient has a complex medical history and is on multiple medications including heparin, sildenafil, digoxin, and Plavix. He is also being treated for suspected nosocomial pneumonia and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia/SOB: The patient's hypoxemia and SOB may be due to pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema, infiltrate/infection, or possible pulmonary emboli.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have nosocomial pneumonia, and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be continued.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly is necessary.
5. Thrombocytosis: The patient has stable thrombocytosis, likely reactive to recent splenectomy.
6. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, which may be related to prolonged hospital stay, recent surgery,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He was admitted to the ICU for a strangulated hernia repair and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemia and volume overload. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, SOB, fever, leukocytosis, and suspected nosocomial pneumonia (VAP). He also has severe pulmonary hypertension and dCHF, for which he is receiving treatment with sildenafil, heparin, and digoxin. The patient has chronic PEs and is being anticoagulated with heparin and Plavix. He is also diagnosed with anemia, thrombocytosis, and hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia (VAP): The patient shows symptoms such as low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and a questionable infiltrate on CXR. He is already on empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension and is currently on treatment with sildenafil, heparin, and digoxin. Close monitoring and further interventions may be required if there is no improvement.
3. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has dCHF, which can lead to worsening"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB: Multifactorial as stated below. Continues to improve.
   Likely major contributors are pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema
   and likely infiltrate/infection. Also important to consider possible
   pulmonary emboli. [**Month (only) 11**] likely be [**2-4**] volume overload s/p surgery
   consistent with exam and not taking home dose lasix post-op. Further,
   [**2-4**] nosocomial pneumonia, VAP as patient also with low-grade fever,
   leukocytosis, questionable infiltrate on CXR with hx productive cough.
   Also may be related with severe pulmonary HTN, dCHF (bNP 3000s). New PE
   less likely (adequately anticoagulated). Likely related with a
   combination of the above.
   - CTA
   - NAC 600 mg x 4
   - Temporarily hold Lasix today after CTAContinue lasix gtt today with
   goal -1L
   - Continue Heparin gtt.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis); d/c lasix if Cr
   elevates
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 5)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue high flow oxygen, but wean today to 40%
   # Pulmonary HTN
   Stable, severe. Unifying diagnosis unclear given PFO, craniofacial
   facies, hypercoagulability, developmental delay. Likely secondary to
   PFO
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   # Genetic Syndrome
   Clear dysmorphic features and possibility of serious sequelae.
   Therefore send karyotype and on that basis determine if further
   outpatient workup is necessary.
   - Karyotype
   # Chronic PEs
   Unclear etiology, likely secondary and also exacerbating pulmonary HTN.
   Plavix was added to regimen as he presumably had clot while on
   therapeutic dose of coumadin. Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past, but this may be worth revisiting
   (again as an outpatient).  No evidence of new clots since his PFO
   closed. Currently patient remains on hep gtt (plavix stopped).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   # Fever/leukocytosis
   Both are improving. Likely because of antibiotic therapy. WBC now 11s
   and afebrile. Source likely pulmonary. No other findings suggestive of
   infection elsewhere.
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 3)
   - Follow up culture data
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia
   Near 30 and stable, (40.3 last [**Month (only) 93**]). Likely related to prolonged
   hospital stay and recent surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound.
   Now suppression likely given present infection. Given anticoagulation,
   consider GI bleed.
   - Guaiac stools again if suspicion of losses
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Now daily careful abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level ([**1-8**] digoxin level 0.2, [**1-10**] digoxin
   level 0.5)
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS with change to outpatient regimen when closer
   to discharge.
   # GERD: Continue PPI.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Zocor acutely, can restart when closer to
   discharge.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively as on digoxin, sotalol
   and lasix gtt, regular diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: hep gtt, famotidine, bowel regimen with miralax prn
   constipation
   # Access: Peripherals; Will need PICC line for access after resolution
   of fevers; try for this PM
   # Communication: Patient; Will get in touch with patient
s father

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB: Multifactorial as stated below. Continues to improve.
   Likely major contributors are pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema
   and likely infiltrate/infection. Also important to consider possible
   pulmonary emboli. [**Month (only) 11**] likely be [**2-4**] volume overload s/p surgery
   consistent with exam and not taking home dose lasix post-op. Further,
   [**2-4**] nosocomial pneumonia, VAP as patient also with low-grade fever,
   leukocytosis, questionable infiltrate on CXR with hx productive cough.
   Also may be related with severe pulmonary HTN, dCHF (bNP 3000s). New PE
   less likely (adequately anticoagulated). Likely related with a
   combination of the above.
   - Follow up CTA final read
   - Continue NAC 600 mg x 4
   - Restart lasix gtt today with goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue heparin gtt.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis); d/c lasix if Cr
   elevates
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 6; 8 days total)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue high flow oxygen, but wean today to 40%
   # Pulmonary HTN: Stable, severe. Unifying diagnosis unclear given PFO,
   craniofacial facies, hypercoagulability, developmental delay. Likely
   secondary to PFO
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   # Genetic syndrome: Clear dysmorphic features and possibility of
   serious sequelae. Therefore send karyotype and on that basis determine
   if further outpatient workup is necessary.
   - Follow up how to obtain karyotype
   # Chronic PEs
   Unclear etiology, likely secondary and also exacerbating pulmonary HTN.
   Plavix was added to regimen as he presumably had clot while on
   therapeutic dose of coumadin. Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past, but this may be worth revisiting
   (again as an outpatient).  No evidence of new clots since his PFO
   closed. Currently patient remains on hep gtt (plavix stopped).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   - Defer today on restarting home dose Coumadin (if restart, will first
   start with half dose given concurrent abx)
   # Fever/leukocytosis. Both are improving likely because of antibiotic
   therapy. WBC now 12, afebrile. Source likely pulmonary. No other
   findings suggestive of infection elsewhere.
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 6; 8 days total)
   - Follow up culture data
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia. Stable. Likely related to prolonged hospital stay and recent
   surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound. Now suppression likely
   given present infection. Given anticoagulation, consider GI bleed.
   - Guaiac stools again if suspicion of losses
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Now daily careful abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   - Stop/wean sotalol
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS with change to outpatient regimen when closer
   to discharge.
   # GERD: Continue PPI.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Restart Zocor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), pulmonary hypertension, and decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF). He is currently admitted to the ICU for a strangulated hernia repair and is experiencing hypoexemia, suspected to be caused by pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema, possible pulmonary emboli, and nosocomial pneumonia. The patient is also being treated for chronic PEs, fever, leukocytosis, hypokalemia, anemia, thrombocytosis, diabetes, GERD, hyperlipidemia, and a potential genetic syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: Given the patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and current symptoms of hypoexemia and volume overload, there is a risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension leading to further respiratory distress.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has signs suggestive of nosocomial pneumonia, including low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and a questionable infiltrate on chest X-ray. If left untreated, this could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of recurrent PEs and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. There is still a risk of developing new DVTs or PEs, especially considering the recent surgery and immobilization"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs), and pulmonary hypertension (HTN). He was admitted with a strangulated hernia repair and is currently in the ICU due to worsening respiratory status. The patient's current conditions include hypoexemia, possible nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia), and severe pulmonary HTN. He is also experiencing volume overload, hypokalemia, anemia, thrombocytosis, and a history of atrial flutter. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of recurrent PEs, which can potentially worsen his pulmonary hypertension and lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and a questionable infiltrate on the chest X-ray, suggest the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia. This condition requires prompt antibiotic treatment.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's severe pulmonary HTN may contribute to his respiratory distress and could potentially worsen over time without appropriate management.
4. Volume overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. However, it is important to closely monitor his fluid status to prevent volume overload.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which need to be aggressively managed to avoid complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB
   Major player is pulmonary hypertension in the context of chronic
   pulmonary emboli. Also past PFO. Patient also fluid overloaded.
   - Restart coumadin 3 mg daily (previous home daily dose)
 no extra
   doses given antibiotics
   - Heparin drip
   - NAC completed
   - Stop Lasix drip and convert to IV bolus 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and evaluate
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis); d/c lasix if Cr
   elevates
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 7; 8 days total)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue high flow oxygen 40%
   # Pulmonary HTN
   Stable, severe. Contributors of PFO, chronic PE, hypercoagulability.
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   # Genetic syndrome: Clear dysmorphic features and possibility of
   serious sequelae. Therefore send karyotype and on that basis determine
   if further outpatient workup is necessary.
   - Follow up how to obtain karyotype
   - Hypercoagulable and genetic work-up as outpatient
   # Chronic PEs
   Unclear etiology, likely secondary and also exacerbating pulmonary HTN.
   Patient may also be hypercoagulable and has no spleen and high platelet
   count. Plavix was previously added to regimen as he presumably had clot
   while on therapeutic dose of coumadin. Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past, but this may be worth revisiting
   (again as an outpatient).  No evidence of new clots since his PFO
   closed. Currently patient remains on hep gtt (plavix stopped).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   - Defer today on restarting home dose Coumadin (if restart, will first
   start with half dose given concurrent abx)
   - Do not lose track of possible need for plavix and coumadin
   # Fever/leukocytosis. Both are improving likely because of antibiotic
   therapy. WBC now 12, afebrile. Source likely pulmonary. No other
   findings suggestive of infection elsewhere.
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 6; 8 days total)
   - Follow up culture data
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia. Stable. Likely related to prolonged hospital stay and recent
   surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound. Now suppression likely
   given present infection. Given anticoagulation, consider GI bleed.
   - Guaiac stools again if suspicion of losses
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Now daily careful abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   - Stop/wean sotalol (D/w cardiology)
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS with change to outpatient regimen when closer
   to discharge.
   # GERD: Continue PPI.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Restart Zocor.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively as on digoxin, sotalol
   and lasix gtt, regular diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: hep gtt, famotidine, bowel regimen with miralax prn
   constipation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary emboli (PEs), pulmonary hypertension (HTN), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent herniorrhaphy surgery and is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator. 

24-hour events include a discussion with Dr. [Last Name] about a right heart cath/vasodilator trial, but it was decided to wait until the patient is further optimized. The patient's lasix drip was started late in the evening, and urine output was greater than 100 cc/hr in the morning. 

CTA findings reveal tiny filling defects in the distal subsegmental branches of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally, consistent with chronic pulmonary emboli. There are also bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, which could represent an inflammatory/infectious process. Mediastinal adenopathy is present and stable since [date]. Increased size of the main pulmonary artery is noted, indicating pulmonary arterial hypertension. A small hiatal hernia is also identified.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB
   Major player is pulmonary hypertension in the context of chronic
   pulmonary emboli. Also past PFO. Patient also fluid overloaded.
   - Restart coumadin 3 mg daily (previous home daily dose)
 no extra
   doses given antibiotics
   - Heparin drip
   - NAC completed
   - Stop Lasix drip and convert to IV bolus 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and evaluate
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis); d/c lasix if Cr
   elevates
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 7; 8 days total)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue high flow oxygen 40%
   # Pulmonary HTN
   Stable, severe. Contributors of PFO, chronic PE, hypercoagulability.
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   # Genetic syndrome: Clear dysmorphic features and possibility of
   serious sequelae. Therefore send karyotype and on that basis determine
   if further outpatient workup is necessary.
   - Follow up how to obtain karyotype
   - Hypercoagulable and genetic work-up as outpatient
   # Chronic PEs
   Unclear etiology, likely secondary and also exacerbating pulmonary HTN.
   Patient may also be hypercoagulable and has no spleen and high platelet
   count. Plavix was previously added to regimen as he presumably had clot
   while on therapeutic dose of coumadin. Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past, but this may be worth revisiting
   (again as an outpatient).  No evidence of new clots since his PFO
   closed. Currently patient remains on hep gtt (plavix stopped).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   - Defer today on restarting home dose Coumadin (if restart, will first
   start with half dose given concurrent abx)
   - Do not lose track of possible need for plavix and coumadin
   # Fever/leukocytosis. Both are improving likely because of antibiotic
   therapy. WBC now 12, afebrile. Source likely pulmonary. No other
   findings suggestive of infection elsewhere.
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 6; 8 days total)
   - Follow up culture data
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia. Stable. Likely related to prolonged hospital stay and recent
   surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound. Now suppression likely
   given present infection. Given anticoagulation, consider GI bleed.
   - Guaiac stools again if suspicion of losses
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Now daily careful abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   - Stop/wean sotalol (D/w cardiology)
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS with change to outpatient regimen when closer
   to discharge.
   # GERD: Continue PPI.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Restart Zocor.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively as on digoxin, sotalol
   and lasix gtt, regular diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: hep gtt, famotidine, bowel regimen with miralax prn
   constipation
   # Access: Peripherals; Will need PICC line for access after resolution
   of fevers; try for this PM
   # Communication: Patient; Will get in touch with patient

   # Atrial Flutter (addendum)
   We think atrial flutter was likely exacerbated in the post-operative
   state of fluid overload and possibly worsened thromboembolic pulmonary
   disease. He first had atrial flutter eight years ago which had been
   well controlled with metoprolol tartrate 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Digoxin and sotalol
   (80 mg) were started in [**Hospital3 **]. After hernioraphy. I spoke to
   Cardiology about sotalol given that we think this exacerbation and they
   recommended gradual reduction and continued telemetry, starting with a
   reduction from 80 to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] today with observation. We will want to
   restart his beta-blocker, perhaps as metoprolol succinate for ease of
   dosing. Thus we might work toward, over one to two weeks, stopping
   sotalol and reinstating Toprol 50 mg QD.
   - Reduced sotalol to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Will start metoprolol again depending on rate, with a goal of 50 mg
   QD

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He underwent herniorrhaphy and is now in the ICU due to difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's current conditions include hypoexemia, fluid overload, fever, leukocytosis, hypokalemia, anemia, thrombocytosis, and hypercoagulability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension (PH): The patient has severe PH, which is likely due to chronic PE and a history of PFO. This condition can lead to right heart failure and further complications.

2. Chronic Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of recurrent PE, which can cause pulmonary hypertension and chronic hypoxemia. If not managed properly, it may result in worsening of the patient's respiratory status.

3. Infection: The patient is showing signs of fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

4. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which can result in cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. It needs to be aggressively managed to maintain potassium levels above 4.5.

5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, likely related to prolonged hospital stay"

   Imaging: CTA as above.
   Microbiology: One set of cultures with coag. negative staph.
   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB: Multifactorial as stated below. Continues to improve.
   Likely major contributors are pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema
   and likely infiltrate/infection. Also important to consider possible
   pulmonary emboli. [**Month (only) 11**] likely be [**2-4**] volume overload s/p surgery
   consistent with exam and not taking home dose lasix post-op. Further,
   [**2-4**] nosocomial pneumonia, VAP as patient also with low-grade fever,
   leukocytosis, questionable infiltrate on CXR with hx productive cough.
   Also may be related with severe pulmonary HTN, dCHF (bNP 3000s). New PE
   less likely (adequately anticoagulated). Likely related with a
   combination of the above.
   - Follow up CTA final read
   - Continue NAC 600 mg x 4
   - Restart lasix gtt today with goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue heparin gtt.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis); d/c lasix if Cr
   elevates
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 6; 8 days total)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue high flow oxygen, but wean today to 40%
   # Pulmonary HTN: Stable, severe. Unifying diagnosis unclear given PFO,
   craniofacial facies, hypercoagulability, developmental delay. Likely
   secondary to PFO
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   # Genetic syndrome: Clear dysmorphic features and possibility of
   serious sequelae. Therefore send karyotype and on that basis determine
   if further outpatient workup is necessary.
   - Follow up how to obtain karyotype
   # Chronic PEs
   Unclear etiology, likely secondary and also exacerbating pulmonary HTN.
   Plavix was added to regimen as he presumably had clot while on
   therapeutic dose of coumadin. Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past, but this may be worth revisiting
   (again as an outpatient).  No evidence of new clots since his PFO
   closed. Currently patient remains on hep gtt (plavix stopped).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   - Defer today on restarting home dose Coumadin (if restart, will first
   start with half dose given concurrent abx)
   # Fever/leukocytosis. Both are improving likely because of antibiotic
   therapy. WBC now 12, afebrile. Source likely pulmonary. No other
   findings suggestive of infection elsewhere.
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 6; 8 days total)
   - Follow up culture data
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia. Stable. Likely related to prolonged hospital stay and recent
   surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound. Now suppression likely
   given present infection. Given anticoagulation, consider GI bleed.
   - Guaiac stools again if suspicion of losses
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Now daily careful abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   - Stop/wean sotalol
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS with change to outpatient regimen when closer
   to discharge.
   # GERD: Continue PPI.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Restart Zocor.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively as on digoxin, sotalol
   and lasix gtt, regular diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: hep gtt, famotidine, bowel regimen with miralax prn
   constipation

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent PEs, pulmonary
   HTN, dCHF POD #15 strangulated hernia repair slow vent wean with
   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB
   Major player is pulmonary hypertension in the context of chronic
   pulmonary emboli. Also past PFO (contributor to pulmonary hypertension)
   and patient also fluid overloaded (by about 15 kg from estimated dry
   weight based on OSH notes). Patient producing more sputum now, so will
   need to follow. No suspicion of PNA at this time.
   - Treatment of chronic PE as below.
   - Continue Lasix IV 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] (need to dose with care given fragile
   hemodynamics
 preload dependent
 but has tolerated about
 1 L daily
   well
 is now down ~ 7 L from admission)
 check Lytes [**Hospital1 **] given Lasix
   - Follow CXRs
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis); d/c lasix if Cr
   elevates
   - Empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP to stop
   tonight (currently day 8; 8 days total)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue low flow oxygen by mask (15L) with n.c. for meal times.
   # Chronic Pulmonary Emboli
   Had another PE on coumadin in the past, per OSH note. Therefore was on
   Plavix plus coumadin. Patient reports not tolerating Plavix. Apparently
   hypercoagulable work-up as outpatient, but may be fruitfully revisited.
   Thrombocytosis (s/p splenectomy) may be a contributor. Therefore:
   - ASA 81 mg and coumadin
   - Change from heparin gtt to Lovenox 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] for ease of dosing on
   floor
   - Coumadin 3 mg QD
   # Pulmonary HTN
   Stable, severe. Contributors of PFO, chronic PE, hypercoagulability.
   - Continue sildenafil and digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Treatment of chronic PE as above
   - Stop monitoring digoxin level
 has been stable and can be checked
   again before discharge
   - Pumonary consult and to follow on floor
   # Genetic syndrome: Clear dysmorphic features and possibility of
   serious sequelae. Therefore send karyotype and on that basis determine
   if further outpatient workup is necessary.
   - Karyotype, syndromal, potential further hypercoagulable work-up as
   outpatient.
   # Fever/leukocytosis. Both are improving likely because of antibiotic
   therapy. WBC now 12, afebrile. Source likely pulmonary. No other
   findings suggestive of infection elsewhere.
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 6; 8 days total)
   - Follow up culture data
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia. Stable. Likely related to prolonged hospital stay and recent
   surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound. Now suppression likely
   given present infection. Given anticoagulation, consider GI bleed.
   - Guaiac stools again if suspicion of losses
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   Incision does not look infected, but ooze likely secondary to
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Now daily careful abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable. Patient being anticoagulated for other
   reasons already. Digoxin level stable at around 0.6. Attempt to wean
   sotalol resulted in flutter again.
   - Monitor digoxin in a few days now
   - Continue sotalol and digoxin
 do not restart home metoprolol given
   good control.
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS with change to outpatient regimen when closer
   to discharge.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Restart Zocor.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively as on digoxin, sotalol
   and lasix gtt, regular diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: Coumadin, Lovenox, bowel regimen with miralax prn
   constipation. Stopped pantoprazole today (not on home regimen)
   # Access: PICC line. A-line removed today.
   # Drains: Remove Foley today or leave to floor team.

   improving hypoxemia and volume overload.
   # Hypoexemia/SOB
   Major player is pulmonary hypertension in the context of chronic
   pulmonary emboli. Also past PFO. Patient also fluid overloaded.
   - Restart coumadin 3 mg daily (previous home daily dose)
 no extra
   doses given antibiotics
   - Heparin drip
   - NAC completed
   - Stop Lasix drip and convert to IV bolus 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and evaluate
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis); d/c lasix if Cr
   elevates
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 7; 8 days total)
   - Follow up cultures
   - Continue high flow oxygen 40%
   # Pulmonary HTN
   Stable, severe. Contributors of PFO, chronic PE, hypercoagulability.
   - Continue sildenafil/heparin gtt/digoxin for pulmonary hypertension
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   # Genetic syndrome: Clear dysmorphic features and possibility of
   serious sequelae. Therefore send karyotype and on that basis determine
   if further outpatient workup is necessary.
   - Follow up how to obtain karyotype
   - Hypercoagulable and genetic work-up as outpatient
   # Chronic PEs
   Unclear etiology, likely secondary and also exacerbating pulmonary HTN.
   Patient may also be hypercoagulable and has no spleen and high platelet
   count. Plavix was previously added to regimen as he presumably had clot
   while on therapeutic dose of coumadin. Patient was supposed to have
   hypercoagulable work up in past, but this may be worth revisiting
   (again as an outpatient).  No evidence of new clots since his PFO
   closed. Currently patient remains on hep gtt (plavix stopped).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   - Defer today on restarting home dose Coumadin (if restart, will first
   start with half dose given concurrent abx)
   - Do not lose track of possible need for plavix and coumadin
   # Fever/leukocytosis. Both are improving likely because of antibiotic
   therapy. WBC now 12, afebrile. Source likely pulmonary. No other
   findings suggestive of infection elsewhere.
   - Continue empiric coverage vanc/zosyn for HAP/nosocomial pneumonia/VAP
   (currently day 6; 8 days total)
   - Follow up culture data
   # Hypokalemia: Will need to be aggressively managed. K goal of 4.5.
   - Check PM electrolytes; replete prn with goal to keep K > 4.5
   (aggressive KCl repletion given metabolic alkalosis)
   # Anemia. Stable. Likely related to prolonged hospital stay and recent
   surgery with serosanguinous leak from wound. Now suppression likely
   given present infection. Given anticoagulation, consider GI bleed.
   - Guaiac stools again if suspicion of losses
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Consider transfuse for goal Hct > 21 or unstable
   # Thrombocytosis: Stable; likely reactive [**2-4**] splenectomy.
   - Continue to trend
   # h/o strangulated bowel: s/p surgery.  Continue to monitor BMs.
   - Continue daily dressing changes
   - Now daily careful abdominal exams
   - Obtain surgical consultation if becomes unstable; otherwise needs
   keep outpatient surgical follow up
   # h/o a-flutter s/p cardioversion. Continue sotalol and digoxin as
   patient currently stable.  Question continued need for digoxin at this
   time given fact that he is in sinus.  Will ultimately need a
   cardiologist to follow up with re: sotalol.  Patient being
   anticoagulated for other reasons already.
   - Continue to monitor digoxin level
   - Stop/wean sotalol (D/w cardiology)
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS with change to outpatient regimen when closer
   to discharge.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of PFO repair, recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary hypertension (PHN), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He is currently in the ICU after undergoing a strangulated hernia repair. The patient is having difficulty weaning off the ventilator and is experiencing respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic PEs, hypercoagulability, and no spleen. The patient also has dysmorphic features, suggesting a possible genetic syndrome, and has been prescribed sildenafil and heparin for pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoexemia, which may be caused by pulmonary hypertension in the context of chronic pulmonary emboli and a past patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient is also fluid overloaded, which can worsen hypoxemia.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which is likely secondary to chronic PE, hypercoagulability, and possibly genetic factors. This condition contributes to the difficulty in weaning off the ventilator.
3. Chronic Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has a history of recurrent PEs, which may have led to the development of chronic PE. Chronic PE can contribute to pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure.
4. Hypercoagulability: The patient has a hypercoagulable state, which increases the risk of thrombosis"
