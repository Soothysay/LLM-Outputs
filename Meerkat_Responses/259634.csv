   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic stenosis. The patient was admitted with fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. She is intubated and requires pressors for hemodynamic support.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with dyspnea and hypoxia, and an initial chest X-ray suggested pulmonary edema. She was intubated due to severe respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia given the fever, but there is no significant elevation in white blood cell count. Ischemia leading to pulmonary edema is also a possibility.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially had a fever and continued hypotension despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. The source of sepsis is likely pulmonary based on reported symptoms of cough and fever. Cultures for urine and blood have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an elevated lactate level of 4.5, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is ongoing to maintain adequate intravascular volume.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has a creatinine level of 1.5, likely due"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock. The patient presented initially with fever and continued hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. She required vasopressin and additional medications to maintain blood pressure and optimize mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). 

The patient's condition is complicated by potential mobile vegetation on the aortic valve, which may suggest endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to evaluate this further. The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI), with an initial creatinine level of 1.5 that has improved to 0.9. Renal dosing of medications will be continued, and vancomycin will be dosed every 12 hours with trough monitoring.

Other medical conditions include severe aortic stenosis, with an aortic valve area less than 0.8 cm2 and a gradient of 75. Efforts are being made to optimize cardiac output by weaning PEEP and using diuretics once off pressors. Coronary artery disease status post CABG has been ruled out as a cause of ischemia, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. The patient also has severe Alzheimer's dementia and hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's trans-thoracic echo from yesterday showed vegetation on the aortic valve, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered for today.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received a total of 8 liters of neosynephrine by midnight but was unable to be weaned off of Levophed due to a central venous pressure (CVP) of 17 mmHg.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, vasopressin, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient also has several other medications such as piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/49 to 138/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic shock. She has been intubated and is on invasive ventilation. The source of sepsis is suspected to be from sputum, urine, and cardiac vegetation. Cultures are being obtained, and the patient is currently on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient remains hypotensive despite optimization of central venous pressure (CVP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). She also has pulmonary edema as indicated by a chest X-ray, which requires the use of high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's urine output (U/O) is good despite being pressor-dependent on norepinephrine and vasopressin.

The plan includes performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate the presence of vegetation on the aortic valve. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and renal replacement therapy may be considered if needed. Glycemic control should be maintained, and the patient's lines and intubation should be assessed regularly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to sepsis and acute lung injury. This can progress to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring increased ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with acute respiratory failure, fevers progressing to hypothermia, shock, and sepsis affecting multiple organs. The likely source of infection is the lungs or urine. The patient remains pressor-dependent on levophed and neo to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, and aggressive fluid resuscitation is ongoing. Vasopressin has been added as pressor requirements continue to increase. The patient is on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, with follow-up cultures. Septic shock is likely due to a respiratory source, and good urine output is maintained. Pressor requirements are improving, and efforts are being made to optimize central venous pressure (CVP) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2). Stress steroids and activated protein C (APC) are being considered if the condition worsens.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and is being maintained on mechanical ventilation. Current oxygenation and ventilation are adequate but require high FiO2. The plan is to increase positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to allow for FiO2 wean. If persistent hemoptysis occurs, flexible bronchoscopy will be performed to rule out airway injury. The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) is being ruled out, and an echocardiogram (Echo) will be checked in the morning. Renal function has been optimized"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a chief complaint of septic shock. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's condition is critical, and she is pressor-dependent on levophed and vasopressin. She also has good urine output despite having tanked up central venous pressure (CVP) and normal mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2). The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Her blood cultures are cooking, and she is being treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's renal function should be followed closely. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is pending once consent is obtained to evaluate for aortic valve vegetation. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is currently on full support in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Organ dysfunction due to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Pulmonary edema, as indicated by the chest X-ray.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorders, which need to be"

   placement.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to a prior study obtained on
   [**2145-3-1**] at 1:43.
   The ET tube tip is currently 2 cm above the carina but given the
   flexion of
   the neck it might be still within the appropriate limits. The central
   venous
   line is in the right atrium approximately 3 cm below the carina. The NG
   tube
   tip is in the stomach. There is no interval change in bilateral pleural
   effusions and bibasal atelectasis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia,
   CAD s/p CABG and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient appears to have hypoxic
   respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of
   difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid
   resuscitation from her septic shock. Overnight she had an acute
   desaturation event. CXR appears to show volume loss either secondary to
   fluid accumulation or mucous plugging.
   -          bedside ultrasound to assess for tapable fluid
   -          bronchoscopy
   -          continue to wean peep today (did not tolerate earlier, but
   should reattempt)
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient presented initially with fever to 102.
   Continued hypotension despite 5L IV, although Levophed was able to be
   weaned off this morning. She remains on vasopressin now. UOP is
   dwindling, and did not respond to efforts to improve preload, but
   perhaps needs to be given at a faster bolus. Sources most likely
   pulmonary based on reported sx of cough and fever followed by rapidly
   worsening resp failure, however urine cx growing e coli. Endocarditis
   to be evaluated by TEE today.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin, on stress dose
   steroids since yesterday
   - will attempt to wean PEEP, to improve CO in setting of AS
   - consider another bolus to improve preload and uop
   - measure CvO2
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn/levaquin
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx
 follow e coli sensitivities
   - RRVS negative
   - CE negative
   - TEE did not find vegetations
   # Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable 4-5:1 block. Seems
   to be vagal response, but improves when not stimulated. Will check TSH.
   .
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .
   # ARF
 Cr 1.5 on admit now 0.9 - likely prerenal from sepsis, cont to
   monitor and renally dose meds. Changed to vanc 750 Q12, check trough in
   am
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis
 Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75, try to
   optimize CO by weaning PEEP as above, will need diuresis once off
   pressors
   .
   # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. PO meds on hold for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
 cont. synthroid IV, checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, start TF following TEE/bronch

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient experienced several events overnight, including an acute desaturation event and low urine output. Her chest X-ray showed volume loss in the left lung, possibly due to fluid accumulation or mucous plugging. The physician's assessment and plan include further evaluation with a bedside ultrasound to assess for tapable fluid, bronchoscopy, weaning of PEEP, and continued sedation as tolerated.

The patient's septic shock is being managed with vasopressin and stress dose steroids. Efforts are being made to improve preload and urine output. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and blood and urine cultures are pending. The physician also plans to evaluate for endocarditis using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and rule out ischemia.

Additionally, the patient has bradycardia, which is thought to be vagal response, and the TEE did not find vegetations on the valves. Acute kidney injury (ARF) is suspected to be prerenal from sepsis, and renal dosing of medications is being considered. The patient's severe aortic stenosis requires optimization of cardiac output by weaning PEEP and possibly di"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ranging from 73 to 78 mmHg. Heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 54 to 71 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation is maintained at around 97%. The patient has been receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, fentanyl, vasopressin, midazolam, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of clinical signs and regular chest X-rays can help in early detection.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating an ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial to detect any worsening of the septic state.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has shown fluctuations in electrolyte levels, such as potassium, sodium"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and severe sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 113/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's urine output has dropped to 15 cc/hour, and there is evidence of volume loss in the left lung, suggesting a possible mucous plug. The patient is receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, fentanyl, vasopressin, and midazolam.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (17.0 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (8.7 g/dL), elevated blood glucose (158 mg/dL), and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium (3.0 mEq/L), low magnesium (1.5 mg/dL), and normal calcium (7.6 mg/dL). The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 03/02/2145 at 02:51 PM.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, severe sepsis, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. 

The patient's medical history is significant for being unable to provide history due to sedation. Allergies are non-existent. The patient has received various antibiotics including levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. 

Infusions of fentanyl, vasopressin, and midazolam (Versed) are being administered. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 47 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 92/43 mmHg to 76/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is experiencing atrial flutter with a heart rhythm of 40s and is hypothermic.

Physical examination reveals cool skin and symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds on the right side and diminished breath sounds on the left side. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, elevated platelet count of 236, and slightly decreased hematocrit at 29.6%. Blood cultures have been obtained from the sputum and urine, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic shock.
- She has respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and electrolyte & fluid disorder.
- Source of sepsis includes sputum, urine with E. coli, and cardiac vegetation.
- The patient's right lung collapse is likely due to a pleural effusion rather than a mucus plug.
- She is currently on vasopressin and being weaned off other pressors.
- The patient's urine output is low, and she is being given fluid boluses to see if she responds.
- She has atrial flutter with bradycardia, but no EKG changes have been observed.
- The patient is hypothermic, sedated, and unable to provide history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to respiratory failure. This could be due to the lung collapse, pleural effusion, or mucus plugging. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It can lead to organ failure if not promptly treated.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which may"

   # Septic Shock - The patient presented initially with fever to 102.
   Continued hypotension despite 5L IV, which required 3 presors,
   Levophed/Neosynephrine/Vasopressin.  Concern was for sepsis but
   currently no focal source of infection.  Sputum cultures and blood
   cultures remain negative.  Urine culture shows E.coli with
   10,000-100,000 colonies which was pan-sensitive.  Currently on
   Levophed/Vasopressin.  Dopamine was attempted yesterday but was not
   tolerated as she developed NSVT.

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema caused by difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and fluid resuscitation from septic shock. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, bradycardia, possible aortic valve vegetation, acute renal failure (resolved), history of CAD post CABG with an ejection fraction of 40%, severe aortic stenosis, severe Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, and electrolyte imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient develops further lung issues such as pneumonia or continued atelectasis. Cardiogenic shock may persist or worsen due to the patient's severe aortic stenosis and the strain on the heart. Sepsis could still be a concern even though blood cultures remain negative, as the urine culture shows E.coli with a high colony count which is pan-sensitive. Bradycardia and the development of atrial fibrillation with variable block are also potential complications. Acute renal failure may recur if the patient's kidney function continues to deteriorate."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia,
   CAD s/p CABG and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient appears to have hypoxic
   respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of
   difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid
   resuscitation from her septic shock. Overnight she had an acute
   desaturation event. CXR appears to show volume loss either secondary to
   fluid accumulation or mucous plugging.
   -          bedside ultrasound to assess for tapable fluid
   -          bronchoscopy
   -          continue to wean peep today (did not tolerate earlier, but
   should reattempt)
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient presented initially with fever to 102.
   Continued hypotension despite 5L IV, although Levophed was able to be
   weaned off this morning. She remains on vasopressin now. UOP is
   dwindling, and did not respond to efforts to improve preload, but
   perhaps needs to be given at a faster bolus. Sources most likely
   pulmonary based on reported sx of cough and fever followed by rapidly
   worsening resp failure, however urine cx growing e coli. Endocarditis
   to be evaluated by TEE today.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin, on stress dose
   steroids since yesterday
   - will attempt to wean PEEP, to improve CO in setting of AS
   - consider another bolus to improve preload and uop

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema due to difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and fluid resuscitation from her septic shock. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen due to continued pulmonary edema and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Septic Shock: Despite initial improvement, the patient remains at risk for further complications of septic shock, such as organ dysfunction and multiple organ failure.
3. Endocarditis: Although a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not find vegetations, there is still a possibility of endocarditis given the patient's symptoms and risk factors.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.5, which has improved to 0.9. Close monitoring of renal function is essential to prevent or manage AKI.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's variable atrioventricular (AV) block requires further evaluation, including checking thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.
6. Aortic Sten"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic and cardiogenic shock, multiple valvular abnormalities, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. She has been admitted to the ICU for critical care.

24-hour Events:
- Transesophageal echo and bronchoscopy were performed.
- Mucus plug was removed by bronchoscopy, and cultures were sent.
- The patient's condition required increasing levels of vasopressors (levophed and vasopressin) due to hypotension and bradycardia, which resulted in non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).
- Dopamine was initially used for hypotension and bradycardia but was switched to levophed.
- The patient received various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), piperacillin, and vancomycin.

Vital Signs:
- Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F) with a maximum of 35.6°C (96°F).
- Heart Rate: 59 bpm with a range of 49-83 bpm.
- Blood Pressure: 116/54 mmHg with a range of 76-143/39-98 mmHg.
- Respiratory Rate: 14 breaths per minute with a range of 13-15 breaths per minute.
- Oxygen Saturation: 99% on endotracheal tube ventilation.
- Cardiac rhythm: Sinus bradycardia.
- Central Venous Pressure (CVP): 17 mmHg with a range of 11-30 mmHg.
- Cardiac Output (CO)/Cardiac Index (CI) (Fick): 2.8 L/min / 1.7 L/min/m².
- Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation: 38-71%.

Fluid Balance:
- Total input: 3,849 mL (1,005 mL in the last 24 hours).
- Total output: 3,527 mL (780 mL in the last 24 hours).

Respiratory Support:
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

Physical Examination:
- Eyes/Conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils equal, round, and reactive to light).
- Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Endotracheal tube in place.
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds (S1 and S2), systolic murmur.
- Peripheral V"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic and cardiogenic shock, multiple valvular abnormalities, and a history of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 116/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a central venous pressure of 17 mmHg, cardiac output of 2.8 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation of 38-71%. She is receiving vasopressin, dopamine, and levophed infusions. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals recurrent right lower lobe collapse. The patient has ineffective coping, bradycardia, respiratory failure, severe sepsis, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The plan includes weaning down antibiotics, optimizing heart rate and blood pressure, bronchoscopy, sedation weaning, and potential thoracentesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of acquiring a nosocomial infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a chief complaint of cardiogenic shock. She underwent an unsuccessful bronchoscopic procedure and had arterial line removal. The patient did not tolerate spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning, leading to being placed back on assisted ventilation. She also experienced significant pink/frothy secretions overnight. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various antibiotics, including Piperacillin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient is currently receiving vasopressin infusion and heparin sodium prophylaxis. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55-111/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her CVP is within normal range at 20 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, troponin T, total CO2, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock, ineffective coping, bradycardia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, inability to protect the airway ("

   FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. A
   nasogastric
   tube terminates in the expected location of stomach, unchanged. Also
   unchanged is a right internal jugular central venous line terminating
   in the
   right atrium. Multiple sternotomy wires are unchanged as are multiple
   vascular clips consistent with previous coronary arterial bypass graft.
   Bilateral pleural effusions are likely unchanged due to positional
   differences. Leftward mediastinal and cardiac deviation is unchanged,
   suggesting left volume loss and the cardiac border is obscured by the
   overlying opacity.
   IMPRESSION: Overall, minimally changed radiograph.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia,
   CAD s/p CABG and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient has hypoxic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult
   hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation from
   her septic shock.  Mixed venous sat low today in the 40s but also has a
   normal lactate.  At this point, the patient most likely is suffering
   from cardiogenic shock, cardiology was consulted, but feel aside from
   valvuloplasty, there is not much from there standpoint left to do.  We
   do not believe she is a candidate for valvuloplasty given her tenuous
   status.
   -          bronchoscopy yesterday showed thick mucous.
   -          ? pleural effusions able to be tapped
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   # Septic Shock : There continues to be no focal source of infection,
   aside from pansensitive E coli isolated from urine, which we do not
   believe is the source for her decompensation.  Sputum cultures were
   negative and TEE did not find vegetations; blood cultures remain
   negative.  BAL
s show polys.  Currently weaned off Levophed but
   continues on Vasopressin.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin/levophed, cont
   stress dose steroids
   - will attempt to wean PEEP, to improve CO in setting of AS
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn
   - f/u blood cultures
   - d/c stress dose steroids
   # Vomiting: unclear etiology. Restart tubefeeds, reglan if high
   residuals.
    # Intermittent Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable
   4-5:1 block. Seems to be vagal response, but improves when not
   stimulated.
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .# ARF
 creatinine starting to creep upwards, which is likely
   secondary to poor forward flow from AS. Urine lytes.
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   # Aortic Stenosis
 Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75, try to
   optimize CO by weaning PEEP as above.  Cardiology following.
   # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. PO meds on hold for now
   # Hypothyroidism
 cont. synthroid, TSH mildly elevated, will check T4
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, start TF following TEE/bronch

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, vomiting, intermittent bradycardia, possible aortic valve vegetation, acute renal failure (ARF), and severe aortic stenosis. The patient's medical team is considering aortic valvuloplasty but believes she may not be a candidate due to her tenuous status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, leading to inadequate circulation and organ perfusion. This can result in multiorgan dysfunction and failure.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory system is failing to adequately oxygenate the blood, leading to tissue hypoxia. This can cause damage to vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by increasing creatinine levels. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease and require renal replacement therapy.
4. Septic Shock: The patient remains at risk for recurrent septic shock due to persistent infection and inadequate source control. This can lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially death.
5. Aortic Valve Vegetation: Although"

   Assessment and Plan: 84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia,
   CAD s/p CABG and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient has hypoxic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult
   hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation from
   her septic shock.  Mixed venous sat low today in the 40s but also has a
   normal lactate.  At this point, the patient most likely is suffering
   from cardiogenic shock.  Plan is for cardiology consult to assist with
   likely component of cardiogenic shock.
   -          bronchoscopy today for further evaluation of left lung for
   possible mucous plug
   -          continue to wean peep today as tolerated
   -          wean levophed
   -          may add dobutamine to increase Cardiac output
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   # Septic Shock - The patient presented initially with fever to 102.
   Continued hypotension despite 5L IV, which required 3 presors,
   Levophed/Neosynephrine/Vasopressin.  Concern was for sepsis but
   currently no focal source of infection.  Sputum cultures and blood
   cultures remain negative.  Urine culture shows E.coli with
   10,000-100,000 colonies which was pan-sensitive.  Currently on
   Levophed/Vasopressin.  Dopamine was attempted yesterday but was not
   tolerated as she developed NSVT.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin/levophed, cont
   stress dose steroids
   - will attempt to wean PEEP, to improve CO in setting of AS
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn
   - d/c levaquin
   - f/u blood cultures
   - CE negative
   - TEE did not find vegetations
    # Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable 4-5:1 block.
   Seems to be vagal response, but improves when not stimulated.
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .# ARF
 Resolved
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   # Aortic Stenosis
 Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75, try to
   optimize CO by weaning PEEP as above.  Cardiolgy consulted for concern
   with cardiogenic shock.
   # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. PO meds on hold for now

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD post CABG, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock, respiratory failure (non-ARDS), ineffective coping, bradycardia, and possible AV vegetation. The patient's condition has been complex, with various medical complications arising. 

Some potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is experiencing difficulty with hemodynamics in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and fluid resuscitation from septic shock. This may be contributing to her respiratory failure as well.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema. This could be due to the difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation.

3. Sepsis: The patient presented initially with fever and continued hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, requiring multiple vasopressors. There is concern for sepsis, but no focal source of infection has been identified yet.

4. Bradycardia: The patient is in aflutter with variable 4-5:1 block. This seems to be a vagal response, but improves when not stimulated.

5. Possible AV vegetation: The patient has severe AS with calcified valves, and there is a suggestion of mobile vegetation on the valve. However, a transesophageal echocardiogram"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with septic and cardiogenic shock, multiple valvular abnormalities, and various medical complications. 

1. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and cardiogenic shock. Immediate interventions include weaning down antibiotics, optimizing heart rate and blood pressure with the help of a cardiology consult, and using vasopressors like dopamine, milrinone, coreg, and digoxin. The patient is also on stress dose steroids.

2. The patient's respiratory status is critical as indicated by acute respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy has been performed, and plans are to wean sedation and put the patient on pressure support ventilation (PSV). If the patient fails to respond, a thoracentesis may be considered.

3. The patient has ineffective coping strategies and requires psychological support. Daily discussions with the son regarding the patient's status are being held.

4. The patient has bradycardia and is on medications such as coreg and digoxin to manage it.

5. The patient is at risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect her airway. Altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance are concerns.

6. The patient has electrolyte and fluid disorders, which require careful monitoring and management.

7. The patient has septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction and requires close monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and response to treatment.

8. The patient has a do"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic and cardiogenic shock, multiple valvular abnormalities, and ineffective coping. She has respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and a risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect her airway. There are also concerns about electrolyte and fluid disorders.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's heart is not pumping enough blood to meet the body's needs, which can lead to organ failure.
2. Septic shock: The patient has a severe infection that is causing systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's lungs are not adequately oxygenating her blood, which can result in tissue damage and organ failure if not promptly addressed.
4. Valvular abnormalities: The patient has multiple valve issues in her heart, which can affect blood flow and increase the risk of heart failure or other cardiac complications.
5. Ineffective coping: The patient may struggle with adapting to the ICU environment and managing stress, potentially leading to further complications.
6. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is lower than normal, which can reduce cardiac output and lead to inadequate perfusion of organs.
7. Risk for aspiration: Due to an impaired ability to protect her airway, the patient is at risk of inhaling stomach contents into her lungs, causing pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
8. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient may have imbalances"

She has been experiencing issues with ineffective airway clearance, aspiration pneumonia, mucus plugs, and pleural effusions. There are new infiltrates on her right lung, and she has been receiving antibiotics. The patient's renal function is declining, and she is also experiencing vomiting. She has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function due to aspiration pneumonia, mucus plugs, pleural effusions, and new infiltrates.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of cardiogenic shock, and there is a risk of worsening cardiac function, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. There is a risk of progression to septic shock, characterized by hypotension and multiple organ failure.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function is declining, as indicated by rising creatinine levels. This may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia,
   CAD s/p CABG and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient has hypoxic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult
   hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation from
   her septic shock.  Mixed venous sat low today in the 40s but also has a
   normal lactate.  At this point, the patient most likely is suffering
   from cardiogenic shock, cardiology was consulted, but feel aside from
   valvuloplasty, there is not much from there standpoint left to do.  We
   do not believe she is a candidate for valvuloplasty given her tenuous
   status.
   -          bronchoscopy yesterday showed thick mucous.
   -          ? pleural effusions able to be tapped
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   # Septic Shock : There continues to be no focal source of infection,
   aside from pansensitive E coli isolated from urine, which we do not
   believe is the source for her decompensation.  Sputum cultures were
   negative and TEE did not find vegetations; blood cultures remain
   negative.  BAL
s show polys.  Currently weaned off Levophed but
   continues on Vasopressin.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin/levophed, cont
   stress dose steroids
   - will attempt to wean PEEP, to improve CO in setting of AS
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn
   - f/u blood cultures
   - d/c stress dose steroids
   # Vomiting: unclear etiology. Restart tubefeeds, reglan if high
   residuals.
    # Intermittent Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable
   4-5:1 block. Seems to be vagal response, but improves when not
   stimulated.
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .# ARF
 creatinine starting to creep upwards, which is likely
   secondary to poor forward flow from AS. Urine lytes.
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   # Aortic Stenosis

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and now presents with multiple medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema due to difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and fluid resuscitation from septic shock. 

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is suffering from cardiogenic shock, and cardiology was consulted. However, aside from valvuloplasty, there is not much from their standpoint left to do. The patient is not believed to be a candidate for valvuloplasty given her tenuous status.

3. Septic Shock: There continues to be no focal source of infection, aside from pansensitive E. coli isolated from urine, which we do not believe is the source for her decompensation. Sputum cultures were negative, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not find vegetations; blood cultures remain negative. Bronchoscopy yesterday showed thick mucous, and pleural effusions able to be tapped. The patient is currently weaned off Levophed but continues on Vasopressin.

4. Vomiting: The etiology of vomiting is unclear. Tubefeeds are to be restarted, along with Reg"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia,
   CAD s/p CABG and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient has hypoxic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult
   hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation from
   her septic shock.  Mixed venous sat low today in the 40s but also has a
   normal lactate.  At this point, the patient most likely is suffering
   from cardiogenic shock, cardiology was consulted, but feel aside from
   valvuloplasty, there is not much from there standpoint left to do.  We
   do not believe she is a candidate for valvuloplasty given her tenuous
   status.
   -          bronchoscopy yesterday showed thick mucous.
   -          ? pleural effusions able to be tapped
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   # Septic Shock : There continues to be no focal source of infection,
   aside from pansensitive E coli isolated from urine, which we do not
   believe is the source for her decompensation.  Sputum cultures were
   negative and TEE did not find vegetations; blood cultures remain
   negative.  BAL
s show polys.  Currently weaned off Levophed but
   continues on Vasopressin.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin/levophed, cont
   stress dose steroids
   - will attempt to wean PEEP, to improve CO in setting of AS
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn
   - f/u blood cultures
   - d/c stress dose steroids
   # Vomiting: unclear etiology. Restart tubefeeds, reglan if high
   residuals.
    # Intermittent Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable
   4-5:1 block. Seems to be vagal response, but improves when not
   stimulated.
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .# ARF
 creatinine starting to creep upwards, which is likely
   secondary to poor forward flow from AS. Urine lytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 450 mL. The patient's blood pressure is low at 91/41 mmHg, and he has an elevated heart rate of 71 beats per minute. His temperature is slightly elevated at 37.8°C (100.1°F). The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 15.5 K/uL, indicating an infection. The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated at 1.2 mg/dL, and his blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient has a history of shock, cardiogenic in origin, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. He is at risk for aspiration due to an ineffective airway clearance mechanism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of sepsis indicate a high risk for further infection and septic shock.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of cardiogenic shock increases the risk of recurrent or worsening cardiac dysfunction.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly low potassium and magnesium, may require correction to maintain proper organ"

   Assessment and Plan
   84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient has hypoxic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult
   hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation from
   her septic shock.  Mixed venous sat low today in the 40s but also has a
   normal lactate.  At this point, the patient most likely is suffering
   from cardiogenic shock, cardiology was consulted, but feel aside from
   valvuloplasty, there is not much from there standpoint left to do.  We
   do not believe she is a candidate for valvuloplasty given her tenuous
   status.
   -          bronchoscopy yesterday showed thick mucous.
   -          Ultrasound of lungs failed to show tapable effusion
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   # Septic Shock : There continues to be no focal source of infection,
   aside from pansensitive E coli isolated from urine, which we do not
   believe is the source for her decompensation.  Sputum cultures were
   negative and TEE did not find vegetations; blood cultures remain
   negative.  BAL
s show polys.  Currently weaned off Levophed but
   continues on Vasopressin.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin/levophed, off
   stress dose steroids
   - will attempt to wean PEEP, to improve CO in setting of AS
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn (Vanc DC
d for Level of
   30, repeat level in am)
   - f/u blood cultures
   - d/c stress dose steroids
   # Vomiting: unclear etiology. Restart tubefeeds, start reglan, no
   further episodes
    # Intermittent Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable
   4-5:1 block. Seems to be vagal response, but improves when not
   stimulated.
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .# ARF
 creatinine starting to creep upwards, which is likely
   secondary to poor forward flow from AS. Urine lytes c/w prerenal
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   # Aortic Stenosis
 Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75, try to
   optimize CO by weaning PEEP as above.  Cardiology following.
   # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. PO meds on hold for now
   # Hypothyroidism
 cont. synthroid, TSH mildly elevated, will check T4
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, VAP bundle, H2 blocker
   # Access: RIJ
   # Code: DNR/ok to intubate

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema resulting from difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and fluid resuscitation from septic shock.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is suffering from cardiogenic shock, and cardiology has been consulted. However, the patient is not considered a candidate for valvuloplasty due to her tenuous status.

3. Septic Shock: The patient continues to have septic shock with no focal source of infection identified. Pansensitive E. coli isolated from urine does not seem to be the source of her decompensation. Sputum cultures were negative, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not find vegetations, and blood cultures remain negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) shows polys.

4. Vomiting: The etiology of the patient's vomiting is unclear. Tubefeeds have been restarted, and Reglan has been started, with no further episodes reported.

5. Intermittent Bradycardia: The patient is in atrial flutter with variable 4"

   CAD s/p CABG and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient has hypoxic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult
   hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation from
   her septic shock.  Mixed venous sat low today in the 40s but also has a
   normal lactate.  At this point, the patient most likely is suffering
   from cardiogenic shock, cardiology was consulted, but feel aside from
   valvuloplasty, there is not much from there standpoint left to do.  We
   do not believe she is a candidate for valvuloplasty given her tenuous
   status.
   -          bronchoscopy yesterday showed thick mucous.
   -          ? pleural effusions able to be tapped
   -          wean sedation as tolerated
   # Septic Shock : There continues to be no focal source of infection,
   aside from pansensitive E coli isolated from urine, which we do not
   believe is the source for her decompensation.  Sputum cultures were
   negative and TEE did not find vegetations; blood cultures remain
   negative.  BAL

   continues on Vasopressin.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin/levophed, cont

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure. She is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock and has been weaned off Levophed but continues on Vasopressin. The patient's blood cultures remain negative, and there is no focal source of infection identified aside from a urinary tract infection with pansensitive E. coli. The patient's condition is complicated by intermittent bradycardia, vomiting, possible aortic valve vegetation, acute renal failure, and severe aortic stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is suffering from cardiogenic shock due to severe aortic stenosis and fluid resuscitation from septic shock. This can lead to poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation. This can lead to further deterioration of respiratory function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are starting to creep upwards, which is likely secondary to poor forward flow from AS. This can lead to worsening renal function and potential need for renal replacement therapy.

4. Vomiting: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic and cardiogenic shock, multiple valvular abnormalities, and tight aortic stenosis not eligible for valvuloplasty. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure (not ARDS), ineffective coping, bradycardia, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's airway is at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance due to her altered mental status. She also has an L small effusion on chest X-ray and improved R infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. Continuous monitoring and support through mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis appears to have resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence if infection persists or new infections occur. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection markers is necessary.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock needs to be closely monitored and managed to maintain adequate cardiac output and blood pressure. Inotropic medications and fluid management are important in this context.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of respiratory distress and pneumonia symptoms is crucial.
5. Valvular Abnormalities: The patient's multiple valvular abnormalities"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic and cardiogenic shock, multiple valvular abnormalities, and a history of tight aortic stenosis not suitable for valvuloplasty. The patient's condition has improved slightly, as she is more responsive and off pressors. However, she remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may be due to her inability to protect her airway and risk for aspiration. She also has an aspiration pneumonia on the right side and a mucus plug in the left bronchus, along with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. These factors pose barriers to weaning her off mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, it is important to continue monitoring her low-grade fever and endotracheal balloon cuff leak count. There is a possibility of reintroducing sepsis, so careful observation is necessary.

3. Shock: The patient still has cardiogenic shock, which may be attributed to her valvular abnormalities. Close monitoring of her hemodynamic status is essential to prevent further deterioration.

4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which requires careful management. Imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium levels need to be corrected to maintain proper bodily functions.

5. Organ Dysfunction: Given the severity of the patient's illness"

   Assessment and Plan
   84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 the patient has hypoxic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult
   hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation from
   her septic shock.  Mixed venous sat low today in the 40s but also has a
   normal lactate.  At this point, the patient most likely is suffering
   from cardiogenic shock, cardiology was consulted, but feel aside from
   valvuloplasty, there is not much from there standpoint left to do.  We
   do not believe she is a candidate for valvuloplasty given her tenuous
   status.
   -          bronchoscopy showed thick mucous.
   -          Ultrasound of lungs failed to show tapable effusion
   -          sedation weaned off
   - lasix gtt started for pulm edema, net goal 1L neg daily
   # Septic Shock : There continues to be no focal source of infection,
   aside from pansensitive E coli isolated from urine, which we do not
   believe is the source for her decompensation.  Sputum cultures were
   negative and TEE did not find vegetations; blood cultures remain
   negative.  BAL
s show polys.  Currently weaned off Levophed but
   continues on Vasopressin.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65, cont vasopressin/levophed, off
   stress dose steroids
   - will attempt to wean PEEP, to improve CO in setting of AS
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn (Vanc DC
d for Level of
   30, repeat level in am)
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # UTI
 pan-sensitive E. Coli culture date [**2-28**]
 pt on zosyn for PNA as
   above
   .
   # Vomiting: unclear etiology. Restart tubefeeds, start reglan, no
   further episodes
    # Intermittent Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable
   4-5:1 block. Seems to be vagal response, but improves when not
   stimulated.
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .# ARF
 creatinine starting to creep upwards, which is likely
   secondary to poor forward flow from AS. Urine lytes c/w prerenal
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   # Aortic Stenosis
 Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75, try to
   optimize CO by weaning PEEP as above.  Cardiology following.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure (non ARDS): The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema as a result of difficult hemodynamics in the setting of severe AS and fluid resuscitation from septic shock.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is suffering from cardiogenic shock, and cardiology was consulted. However, the patient is not believed to be a candidate for valvuloplasty given her tenuous status.
3. Septic Shock: The patient continues to have septic shock with no focal source of infection identified. Pansensitive E. coli isolated from urine is not believed to be the source of her decompensation. Sputum cultures were negative, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not find vegetations; blood cultures remain negative.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a pan-sensitive E. Coli culture date [**2-28**] and is currently on Zosyn for pneumonia as above.
5. Vomiting: The etiology of the patient's vomiting is unclear. Tubefeeds were restarted, and Reglan was started, with no"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a septic male with a history of altered mental status, cardio-genic shock, ineffective coping, bradycardia, acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and risk for aspiration. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including fluids, antibiotics, and medications for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure indicates a compromised respiratory system. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in further respiratory distress or even death if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, which can cause widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction. Complications may include multiple organ failure, septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardio-genic shock suggests impaired cardiac function. This can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia, potentially leading to further organ damage or failure.
4. Aspiration Risk: Due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia and respiratory complications.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results indicate electrolyte abnormalities, such as potassium and sodium imbalances."

   improvement in the aeration of the right lung base, with substantial
   residual
   consolidation or atelectasis. Left base opacity persists, likely
   representing
   any combination of effusion and atelectasis. Mediastinal contours are
   unchanged. Osseous structures are stable.
   IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in aeration at the right base.
   Otherwise, no

   Assessment and Plan
   84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 Multiple components which include
   sepsis which required fluid resuscitation in the setting of
   hypotension.  Patient now with pulmonary edema [**3-1**] fluid overload and
   severe aortic stenosis.  Also with left pleural effusion as well which
   is not amenable to tap via U/S.  Plan is for diuresis, however, patient
   became hypotensive this morning so diuresis on hold.  Cardiology
   following but consensus is that patient is not a candidate for aortic
   valvuloplasty at this time..
   -          wean sedation and attempt SBP in the afternoon
   -          hold diuresis, resume once normotensive
   # Septic Shock :  +UTI with only 10.000-100.000 organisms which makes
   this source unlikely.  Plan is to treat for 7 days with Vanco/Zosyn as
   there is no clear source at this time
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65,
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # UTI
 pan-sensitive E. Coli culture date [**2-28**]
 pt on zosyn for PNA as
   above, will complete 7 day course
   .
   # Vomiting: unclear etiology, occurred 2 days ago, no further episodes
    # Intermittent Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable
   4-5:1 block. Seems to be vagal response, but improves when not
   stimulated.
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .# ARF
 currently resolved, will cont to monitor in setting of
   diuresis
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   # Aortic Stenosis
 Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75,
   Cardiology following.
   # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. PO meds on hold for now
   # Hypothyroidism
 cont. synthroid
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, VAP bundle, H2 blocker
   # Access: RIJ
   # Code: DNR/ok to intubate
   # Communication: Son
   .# Disposition: pending above; will need to readdress goals of care.

   Disposition: ICU currently
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and severe aortic stenosis. The patient was admitted with severe septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure (non-ARDS), severe aortic stenosis, left pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and fluid overload. The plan is to perform diuresis once the patient becomes normotensive. The patient is also being treated for septic shock with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Other medical conditions and plans include:
- UTI: The patient has a pan-sensitive E. coli culture, and she is already on zosyn for pneumonia. A 7-day course of antibiotics will be completed.
- Vomiting: The etiology is unclear, but there have been no further episodes.
- Intermittent Bradycardia: The patient is in a flutter with variable block, which seems to be a vagal response. It improves when not stimulated.
-?AV Vegetation: There is a suggestion of mobile vegetation on the valve, but transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was negative.
- ARF: Acute renal failure has resolved, and the patient will continue to be monitored during diuresis.
- CAD s/p CABG: Ischemia"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic shock, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and multiple valvular abnormalities. She has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and is not a candidate for valvuloplasty due to comorbidities. The patient's sepsis has resolved, but she remains in cardiogenic shock. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. There may be ongoing barriers to weaning her off the ventilator, including aspiration pneumonia, mucus plug, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, untappable left pleural effusion, and residual sedation with positive urine toxins.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has severe AS and multiple valvular abnormalities, leading to cardiogenic shock. This condition can worsen her hemodynamic instability and impair tissue perfusion.

3. Ineffective coping: The patient is experiencing ineffective coping mechanisms, which may contribute to her altered mental status and inability to interact with staff.

4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, as indicated by her lab results. These imbalances need to be monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

5. Inability to protect airway: The patient has an inability to protect her airway, putting her at risk for aspiration and potential"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic shock, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and multiple valvular abnormalities. She has a history of cardiogenic shock and is not a candidate for valvuloplasty due to comorbidities. The patient's sepsis has resolved, but she remains in cardiogenic shock. She has respiratory failure, altered mental status, ineffective coping, bradycardia, and electrolyte/fluid disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition can worsen if her heart function does not improve or if there is further damage to the heart.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress or develop pneumonia due to aspiration.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's cognitive function may continue to decline, leading to increased confusion or delirium.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient may develop imbalances in electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, or calcium, which can affect heart rhythm and overall health.
5. Infection: Although the sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk of developing new infections due to the presence of medical devices like central lines.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for blood clots in the legs, which can be a precursor to a pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
7. Malnutrition: Prolonged critical illness can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of multiple valvular abnormalities and tight aortic stenosis, who presented with septic and cardiogenic shock. She has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has developed several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, but it appears to have been resolved. However, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of recurrent infection or fever.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac condition is a significant concern, as she has multiple valvular abnormalities and tight aortic stenosis, which are contributing to cardiogenic shock. Management of her cardiac status will be crucial for her overall prognosis.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to factors such as aspiration pneumonia, mucus plug in the left lung, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to these barriers.

4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels and fluid balance need to be closely monitored and managed to avoid further complications.

5. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be attributed to sedation or other underlying causes. It is important to assess and address this issue promptly.

6. Ineffective coping: The patient is struggling to cope with her critical illness,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, cardogenic shock, ineffective coping, bradycardia, acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, inability to protect airway, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple IV medications, and has a DNR code status. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there have been episodes of hypotension. The patient is receiving Lasix to manage fluid balance. Lab results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, which indicates a systemic infection. There is a risk of developing further infections due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and complications related to prolonged intubation.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage if not managed appropriately.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which can result in cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications.
5. Bloodstream Infection: The patient's presence of"

   Assessment and Plan
   84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 Multiple components which include
   sepsis which required fluid resuscitation in the setting of
   hypotension.  Patient now with pulmonary edema [**3-1**] fluid overload and
   severe aortic stenosis.  Also with left pleural effusion as well which
   is not amenable to tap via U/S.  Plan is for diuresis, however, patient
   became hypotensive this morning so diuresis on hold.  Cardiology
   following but consensus is that patient is not a candidate for aortic
   valvuloplasty at this time..
   -          wean sedation and attempt SBP in the afternoon
   -          hold diuresis, resume once normotensive
   # Septic Shock :  +UTI with only 10.000-100.000 organisms which makes
   this source unlikely.  Plan is to treat for 7 days with Vanco/Zosyn as
   there is no clear source at this time
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65,
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # UTI
 pan-sensitive E. Coli culture date [**2-28**]
 pt on zosyn for PNA as
   above, will complete 7 day course
   .
   # Vomiting: unclear etiology, occurred 2 days ago, no further episodes
    # Intermittent Bradycardia
 patient is in aflutter with variable
   4-5:1 block. Seems to be vagal response, but improves when not
   stimulated.
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   .# ARF
 currently resolved, will cont to monitor in setting of
   diuresis
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   # Aortic Stenosis
 Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75,
   Cardiology following.
   # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. PO meds on hold for now
   # Hypothyroidism
 cont. synthroid
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, VAP bundle, H2 blocker
   # Access: RIJ
   # Code: DNR/ok to intubate
   # Communication: Son
   .# Disposition: pending above; will need to readdress goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure, septic shock, urinary tract infection (UTI), vomiting, intermittent bradycardia, possible atrioventricular (AV) vegetation, acute renal failure (ARF), history of CAD s/p CABG, severe aortic stenosis, severe Alzheimer's dementia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/54 mmHg to 67/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including broad-spectrum antibiotics for septic shock, diuretics for fluid overload, and anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, but her kidney function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL."

   84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 Multiple components which include
   sepsis which required fluid resuscitation in the setting of
   hypotension.  Patient now with pulmonary edema [**3-1**] fluid overload and
   severe aortic stenosis, but s/p lasix gtt diuresis with some
   hypotension.  Also with left pleural effusion as well which is not
   amenable to tap via U/S.  Cardiology following but consensus is that
   patient is not a candidate for aortic valvuloplasty at this time.
   Component of contraction alkalosis today, will hold on further diuresis
   as patient seems to be [**Last Name (un) 631**] [**Doctor Last Name 632**] breathing as well.
   -          Continue to wean vent, OOB to chair. Aggressive pulm toilet
   -          hold diuresis
   # Septic Shock :  +UTI with only 10.000-100.000 organisms which makes
   this source unlikely.  Plan is to treat for 7 days with Vanco/Zosyn as
   there is no clear source at this time, today is last day.
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65,
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco/zosyn
   - f/u blood cultures
   # UTI
 pan-sensitive E. Coli culture date [**2-28**]
 pt on zosyn for PNA as
   above, will complete 7 day course
   # ?AV Vegetation
 pt with severe AS and calcified valves, also
   suggestion of mobile vegetation on valve, but TEE to evaluate this was
   negative.
   # ARF
 currently resolved, will cont to monitor in setting of diuresis
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has experienced several medical complications since her admission. These include respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and fluid overload, left pleural effusion that cannot be tapped, contraction alkalosis, urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pan-sensitive E. coli, possible infective endocarditis with mobile vegetation on the valve but negative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), acute renal failure (ARF) which has resolved, and severe aortic stenosis with a gradient of 75.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.2°C, heart rate 72 bpm, blood pressure 93/54 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 96%, and central venous pressure (CVP) 16 mmHg.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.2-15.5 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 30 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.2-1.1 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with septic and cardiogenic shock, multiple valvular abnormalities, and a do not resuscitate (DNR) status. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's mental status has been restless and unresponsive, but has shown improvement today. She is also experiencing tight aortic stenosis and is not a candidate for valvuloplasty due to comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if she is unable to protect her airway and clear secretions effectively. This can lead to further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis appears to have resolved, there is a risk of recurrence if she develops another infection. Monitoring her vital signs and white blood cell count is crucial to detect any signs of infection early.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock needs to be closely monitored, as it can worsen and lead to organ dysfunction or failure. Optimizing her fluid status and managing any underlying cardiac abnormalities are essential.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored to prevent imbalances that can affect her cardiac function and overall well-being.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's imm"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of septic and cardiogenic shock, multiple valvular abnormalities, and tight aortic stenosis who is not a candidate for valvuloplasty due to comorbidities. She has an altered mental status, respiratory failure, severe sepsis, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's condition has shown some improvement, but she remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of aspiration and altered gag reflex. Atelectasis and pleural effusion are present, which can further compromise respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis seems to have resolved, there is a possibility of recurrence if there is a persistent low-grade fever and elevated white blood cell count.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's tight aortic stenosis contributes to cardiogenic shock. Monitoring for signs of worsening cardiac function is crucial.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder that requires close monitoring and management.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is still restless and not following commands. Continued assessment and management of her neurological status are essential.
6. Ineffective coping: The patient is experiencing ineffective coping strategies, which may contribute to her altered mental status and overall well-being.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. The patient was admitted with severe septic shock, which required fluid resuscitation due to hypotension. She also had respiratory failure and pulmonary edema secondary to fluid overload and severe aortic stenosis. The patient has completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia (PNA). Her acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved, and she is being monitored for any signs of recurrence during diuresis. The patient's CAD status post CABG does not show evidence of ischemia, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. She has severe aortic stenosis, with an area of <0.8 cm2 and a gradient of 75. Cardiology is following up with the patient. The patient also has severe Alzheimer's dementia, and her ability to speak is limited to monosyllables and answering yes or no questions. Medications are currently held. She also has hypothyroidism, for which she is taking synthroid. The patient has replete electrolytes and is nil per os (NPO), with tube feeding (TF) on hold. She is on subcutaneous heparin for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD s/p CABG), and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure (non-ARDS), sepsis with organ dysfunction, inability to protect the airway (risk for aspiration), altered mental status (not delirium), electrolyte and fluid disorder, and cardiac dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure (non-ARDS): The patient's severe aortic stenosis and pulmonary edema may contribute to respiratory failure. The presence of left pleural effusion also complicates the respiratory status.

2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient has been treated for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the source of infection remains unclear. The patient's immune system may be compromised due to advanced age and underlying medical conditions.

3. Inability to Protect the Airway: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and altered mental status pose a risk for aspiration. This increases the likelihood of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid overload and diuretic use may lead to electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte management are necessary.

5. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has multiple valvular abnormalities and tight aortic stenosis, making her a non-candidate for valvuloplasty due to comorbidities. The patient was previously diagnosed with sepsis and cardiogenic shock, both of which have been resolved. She is currently stable on mechanical ventilation and is being considered for extubation to the floor or possibly bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern as indicated by the chief complaint. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if she does not tolerate extubation.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk of developing sepsis again due to her immunocompromised state and presence of indwelling lines or devices.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of cardiogenic shock indicates a predisposition to this condition. Any further cardiac events or complications could lead to a recurrence of cardiogenic shock.

4. Aortic stenosis: The patient's tight aortic stenosis poses a long-term risk for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's fluid status is currently optimal,"

   various support and monitoring
   devices remain in place in this patient who has undergone a previous
   CABG
   procedure. The right pleural effusion is again seen with layering along
   the
   lateral pleural space. Smaller left effusion persists. Bibasilar
   atelectatic
   change is seen. The elevation of pulmonary venous pressure appears
   somewhat
   more prominent on the current study.
   Assessment and Plan:
   84y/o F with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock now with respiratory
   failure
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
 Multiple components which include
   sepsis which required fluid resuscitation in the setting of
   hypotension.  Patient now with pulmonary edema [**3-1**] fluid overload and
   severe aortic stenosis.  Extubated yesterday however now with pulm
   edema and evidence of mucus plugging last night, requiring BiPAP. Neg
   >1L with lasix.
   - BIPAP as needed
   - reassess for pleural effusion and consider thoracentesis
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning
   .
   # Septic Shock :  +UTI with only 10.000-100.000 organisms which makes
   this source unlikely.  Patient has completed course of Vanco/Zosyn
   - BP now stable off pressors
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
    # UTI
 pan-sensitive E. Coli culture date [**2-28**]
 pt on zosyn for PNA
   as above, completed 7 day course
   .
    # ARF
 currently resolved, will cont to monitor in setting of
   diuresis
   .
    # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%
   .
    # Aortic Stenosis
 Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75,
   Cardiology following.
   .
    # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. PO meds on hold for now
    # Hypothyroidism
 cont. synthroid
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, holding TF, S&S following possible
   wean of NIIV
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker

 not to re-intubate after
   extubation. Ok with bipap if necessary.
    # Communication: Son
   .# Disposition: Will re-eval for thoracentesis and possible bronch to
   suction mucus plug, if these interventions fail, further options
   limited given severe AS  and pulmonary edema. Plan for family meeting

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and now presents with respiratory failure. The patient had been extubated the previous day but developed acute respiratory distress with pulmonary edema and mucus plugging in the left lobe. She was given a 40mg IV lasix bolus, morphine 2mg IV, lopressor 5mg IV, and placed on bipap. This morning she was briefly weaned to a Venturi mask at 40% but failed and was restarted on BiPAP.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, septic shock, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute kidney injury (AKI), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post CABG, severe aortic stenosis, severe Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, and electrolyte imbalance. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing pulmonary edema and mucus plugging, further deterioration of kidney function, development of new infections, and cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure. Close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, electrolytes, and cardiovascular function are essential."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis.
- The patient was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure, which required invasive ventilation.
- The patient underwent fluid resuscitation due to hypotension and completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics.
- The patient's respiratory distress was attributed to pulmonary edema and likely mucus plugging on the left lobe. 
- The patient received a 40mg IV lasix bolus, morphine, lopressor, and was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).
- The patient was successfully extubated the previous day without complication and continued on lasix.
- The patient's current condition includes intermittent use of BiPAP as needed, encouragement of coughing, and frequent suctioning.
- Other medical conditions include septic shock (with an unlikely urinary tract infection source), urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure (ARF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post CABG, severe aortic stenosis, severe Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, and a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, an 84-year-old female with a history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis, was admitted with severe septic shock. The patient required fluid resuscitation due to hypotension and now presents with pulmonary edema and severe aortic stenosis. 

The patient completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected pneumonia. However, the source of infection is uncertain. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and blood cultures are being monitored. 

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pan-sensitive E. coli and is on lasix for fluid overload. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) has resolved, but the patient will continue to be monitored during diuresis. 

The patient's coronary artery disease post CABG and severe aortic stenosis are being managed by cardiology. The patient's severe Alzheimer's dementia is well-documented, and her baseline communication is limited to monosyllables and yes/no responses. 

The patient's hypothyroidism is being treated with synthroid. Her nutritional status is described as NPO (nothing by mouth), and she has replete electrolytes. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and an H2 blocker. The patient has a right internal jug"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of multiple valvular abnormalities, including aortic stenosis that is not a candidate for valvuloplasty due to comorbidities. She has resolved septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient was extubated but required non-invasive ventilation (NIPPY) due to mucus plugs and mild pulmonary edema. She also has pleural effusions and tight aortic stenosis. The patient's condition is critical, and she has poor prognosis due to inability to clear airway secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to her inability to clear airway secretions and the presence of pulmonary edema.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, she is still at risk for developing sepsis due to her immunocompromised state and ongoing infections.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's aortic stenosis puts her at risk for cardiogenic shock, especially if her cardiac function deteriorates further.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient may develop electrolyte imbalances due to her renal dysfunction and ongoing diuresis.
5. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent worsening respiratory distress.
6. Pleural Effusion: The patient's pleural effusions may require drainage to alleviate"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple valvular abnormalities, including aortic stenosis. She experienced septic and cardiogenic shock but has since resolved. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was extubated yesterday due to improvement. However, she developed respiratory distress due to mucus plugs and pulmonary edema, requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) via bipap.

The patient is currently unresponsive and unable to provide history. She has been receiving medications such as furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management, morphine sulfate for pain and sedation, and metoprolol for heart rate control. Heparin sodium is being administered as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Vital signs show a temperature of 35.4°C (95.8°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/37 to 175/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 60%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a balance of fluids with an input of 814 mL and output of 1,486 mL, including 1,350 mL of urine output.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit, normal platelet count, and normal creatinine levels. Glucose levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of thoracentesis, removal of pleural fluid, and negative chest X-ray for pneumothorax. The patient had a significant decrease in lung volume overnight, requiring the placement of BIPAP for respiratory support. The patient's vital signs show stable heart rate and blood pressure but decreased respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100%. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 2,699 mL since midnight, indicating fluid loss. Hemodynamic monitoring shows normal values. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for decreased lung volume.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened overnight, necessitating the use of BIPAP for respiratory support. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pleural Effusion: The thoracentesis performed yesterday removed 500cc of pleural fluid, but the underlying cause of the pleural effusion needs further investigation. Continued monitoring for signs of recurrent pleural effusion or worsening respiratory status is essential.

3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further investigation into the source of infection is necessary.

4. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate level and decreased albumin indicate potential organ"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure.

24-hour events include thoracentesis, removal of 500cc fluid, and chest X-ray showing no pneumothorax. The patient's condition worsened, and she required BIPAP overnight. Her vital signs are stable, but she has fluid overload and severe aortic stenosis. She is currently on BIPAP as needed, being reassessed for pleural effusion, and considering thoracentesis. Aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning are also being performed.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multiple components contributing to her respiratory failure, including sepsis, fluid resuscitation, hypotension, pulmonary edema, and severe aortic stenosis. She was previously intubated but extubated yesterday. Now, she is experiencing pulmonary edema and mucus plugging, requiring BIPAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient had septic shock requiring fluid resuscitation due to hypotension. She completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam but still has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with pan-sensitive E. Coli. Blood cultures are being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. The patient was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure. She was initially intubated but extubated after experiencing initial respiratory distress and is now on high-flow oxygen only, maintaining saturation levels. The patient underwent thoracentesis, which removed 500cc of fluid, and a chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax. She also received treatment for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia (PNA) with the antibiotics Vancomycin (Vanco) and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's blood pressure is now stable off pressors, and she has completed a 7-day course of Zosyn. Her renal function is currently resolved, and she will continue to be monitored during diuresis. The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis with an ejection fraction of 40%. She is also being followed by cardiology for this condition. The patient has severe Alzheimer's dementia and speaks in monosyllables, only answering yes or no questions. PO medications are on hold for now, but she appears to be back to baseline. The patient has hypothyroidism and is on Synthroid. Her electrolytes are replete, and she is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of underlying dementia and is currently in the ICU. The patient underwent thoracentesis, removing 500 cc of bloody fluid. Her chest X-ray has improved, and she has been given lasix drip. The patient is unable to provide history as she is unresponsive. She has no known drug allergies. She is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as other medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/82 mmHg to 138/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is on high-flow nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a tidal volume of 575 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 95%. The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, with symmetric chest expansion, dullness at the right lung bases, crackles at the left lung base, and rhonchi. She has 3+ sacral edema and absent pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately, but movement, tone, and assessment are not evaluated."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory distress requiring BiPAP support. She is currently stable on high flow oxygen but may require further respiratory support.
2. Septic Shock: The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pan-sensitive E. coli. She completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn and her blood pressure is now stable off pressors.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a UTI caused by E. coli, which was treated with zosyn. However, the source of infection is uncertain due to the low organism count.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF has resolved, but it will be monitored during diuresis.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) s/p CABG: The patient's CAD status post CABG was ruled out as a cause of her symptoms. Her left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is 40%.
6. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of less than 0.8cm2 and a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and hypotension. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Initial laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels. A chest X-ray revealed pulmonary edema. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but cultures are pending. He is also on diuretics, vasopressors, and sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with altered mental status, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggests a systemic infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate potential respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and history of aortic stenosis may suggest cardiogenic shock. Monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac function is essential.
4. Ineffective Coping: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect his airway pose a risk for aspiration. Frequent assessment of mental status and airway protection measures are required.
5. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's ongoing diuresis and fluid management may lead"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 84-year-old female with resolved sepsis and improved mental status but underlying dementia.
- She has stable respiratory function and is on bipap support.
- The patient is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).
- She has a history of aortic stenosis and is not a good candidate for valvuloplasty.
- There are concerns about potential complications such as pulmonary edema, cardiac shock, respiratory failure, ineffective coping, bradycardia, and electrolyte/fluid disorder.
- Physical examination findings include no acute distress, presence of crackles at the left base of the lungs, symmetric chest expansion, warm skin, and 3+ sacral edema.
- Neurologic examination is limited due to the patient's inability to respond adequately.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated levels of creatinine, lactate acid, and lactic acid.
- The patient's prognosis is guarded, and she is likely to have mucus plugging again.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The presence of crackles at the left base of the lungs suggests possible fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Aortic stenosis: The patient has a known history of aortic stenosis, which"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of resolved sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and aortic stenosis. She is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement in her mental status. Her respiratory status is stable on BiPAP. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. She is expected to have mucus plugging again and is at risk for aspiration due to her inability to protect her airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate if she experiences mucus plugging or fails to clear secretions effectively.
2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and sodium, should be closely monitored to prevent imbalances.
3. Infection: Despite resolving sepsis, the patient remains at risk for developing new infections, especially due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines.
4. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's aortic stenosis, she may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or worsening heart failure.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The presence of sacral edema increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which should be monitored and prevented.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure adequate nutrition, especially considering her inability to eat by mouth.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yof with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock now with respiratory
   failure
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
  Likely [**3-1**] to severe AS and sepsis
   requiring fluid resusciation. Patient had left thoracentesis three days
   ago with improvement in left effusion on CXR.  Patient has now been
   extubated.  Currently on intermittent BIPAP and doing well, currently
   on face mask and has good oxygen saturation and looks comfortable.
   Will cont intermittent BIPAP at night.
   - BIPAP as needed
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning
   - continue to run negative with lasix as tolerated by BP
   - Lasix 10mg IV x 1
   - 1L
 1.5 negative today
   - start mucomyst to help with secretions
   - hold tube feeds and start TPN given risk of aspiration with BIPAP

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname **] has continued problems with
   secretion clearance. She need NT suctioining QS and BiPAP for
   ventilatory support.
   Exam notable for Tm100.4 BP 102/44 HR 80-90 RR 26 with sats of 96% on
   NRB . She has audible rales in all lung fields and expiratory wheezing
   at right base.
   Labs notable for WBC9.0 K, HCT of 25.2 , K+3.6 , Cr 0.7 . CXR with
   right sided effuision and clearing left lung ASD.
   Agree with plan to gently siurese, use BiPAP and nebs and NT suctioning
   during daytime. We will hodl tube feeds till bipap needs are less and
   start TPN. We will also use MIE, mucomyst nebs and positional assist to
   help with secretions. She may very well need therapeutic tap of Rt
   effusion if this does not resolve with lasix over next 48 hrs.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and now has respiratory failure. The patient had left thoracentesis three days ago, which showed improvement in left effusion on chest X-ray. She has been extubated and is currently on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support. Her oxygen saturation is good, and she appears comfortable.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed respiratory failure, likely due to severe aortic stenosis and sepsis. She requires BIPAP support at night.
2. Septic Shock: The patient previously experienced septic shock, but her blood pressure is now stable off pressors.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a UTI caused by pan-sensitive E. coli, which has been treated with a seven-day course of Zosyn.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient had ARF, but it has currently resolved.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) post CABG: The patient's CAD status post CABG has been ruled out as a cause of her current condition. Her ejection fraction is 40%.
6. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic"

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. He was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure, but now appears to be doing well on intermittent BiPAP at night. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has severe aortic stenosis and sepsis that required fluid resuscitation. He had a left thoracentesis three days ago, which showed improvement in his left effusion on chest X-ray. He is now extubated and on intermittent BiPAP, with good oxygen saturation and looking comfortable. He will continue with intermittent BiPAP at night.

2. Septic Shock: The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a low organism count, making it an unlikely source of sepsis. He completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Vanco/Zosyn). His blood pressure is now stable off pressors, and he will be followed up with blood cultures.

3. UTI: The patient had a pan-sensitive E. coli culture, which was treated with a 7-day course of Zosyn. 

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is currently resolved, but will be monitored during di"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and has shown improvement in her condition. She has also completed a 7-day course of piperacillin-tazobactam for confirmed E. coli UTI. The patient's acute respiratory failure is likely due to severe aortic stenosis and sepsis. She has been extubated and is currently on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support, which she tolerates well. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is unable to tolerate BIPAP support or if her underlying severe aortic stenosis and sepsis progress.
2. UTI: Despite completing antibiotic therapy, there is a possibility of recurrent UTI due to the presence of indwelling catheters and the patient's immunocompromised state.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient has shown improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions and potential infections in other sites.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD s/p CABG), and aortic stenosis. The patient was admitted with severe septic shock and is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient had a left thoracentesis three days ago, which showed improvement in the left effusion on chest X-ray. The patient has been extubated and is currently on intermittent bipap, tolerating it well with good oxygen saturation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to severe aortic stenosis and sepsis requiring fluid resuscitation.
2. Sepsis: The patient had septic shock caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a pan-sensitive E. Coli culture. However, the source of infection is unlikely.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient had acute kidney injury but it has currently resolved.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) s/p CABG: The patient had coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, but ischemia has been ruled out. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40%.
5. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area less than 0.8cm2 and a gradient of 75.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic stenosis. He was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), which was deemed unlikely due to low organism count. He is currently on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and has shown improvement. The patient's blood pressure is now stable off pressors, and his acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved. His ejection fraction (EF) is 40%. Severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area less than 0.8cm2 and a gradient of 75 is present. The patient's severe Alzheimer's dementia remains unchanged, and he is back to baseline. He also has hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and has chosen to use BIPAP if necessary. His current medications include proton pump inhibitor (PPI), prophylactic heparin, and synthesize. The patient's current care includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN), glycemic control, and management of potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they have been placed on non-invasive ventilation due to tachypnea. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/63 mmHg to 90/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.6°C.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and malnutrition. They also have altered mental status, which is not delirium, and show signs of cardiogenic shock.

The patient's laboratory results indicate low potassium levels, which have been repleted. Other lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in liver function tests and electrolyte levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals an inability to assess peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and some other parameters due to their altered mental status and inability to cooperate.

The patient's medical complications include pulmonary edema, cardiac issues (aortic stenosis and cardiogenic shock), respiratory failure (acute), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration), electrolyte and"

   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock now with respiratory
   failure
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS)
Likely [**3-1**] to severe AS and inability
   to tolerate increased VR off of Bipap. Will attempt enalaprilat and
   continued diuresis with bipap
   - BIPAP as needed
   - low dose enalaprilat x 1 to see effect. If good, can titrate up as
   tolerated
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning
   - continue to run negative with lasix as tolerated by BP
   - -500 negative today
   - mucomyst to help with secretions
   - hold tube feeds and start TPN given risk of aspiration with BIPAP
   # Septic Shock:  +UTI with only 10.000-100.000 organisms which makes
   this source unlikely.  Patient has completed course of Vanco/Zosyn

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname **] has continued problems with
   secretion clearance. She need NT suctioining QS and BiPAP for
   ventilatory support. She is unable to tolerate time off NIPPV for even
   30 mins at a time
   Exam notable for Tm96.4 BP 102/44 HR 80-90 RR 26 with sats of 99% on
   NRB . She has audible rales at right base fields and expiratory
   wheezing in all lung fields. No peripheral edema noted
   Labs notable for WBC 8.1 K, HCT of 24 , K+3.3 , Cr 0.7 . CXR with right
   sided effusion and clearing left lung ASD.
   Agree with plan to gently diurese and start IV enalaprilat, use BiPAP
   and nebs and NT suctioning during daytime. We will hold tube feeds till
   bipap needs are less and start TPN. We will also use MIE, mucomyst nebs
   and positional assist to help with secretions. She may very well need
   therapeutic tap of Rt effusion if this does not resolve with lasix over
   next 48 hrs. Iv Abx will be restarted for possible sinusitis given
   copious mucoid secretions. Extensive update with sons [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 362**]
   today regarding her condition. While they wish the best for her, they
   do not wish for her to be uncomfortable.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 45 min
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tcurrent 35.6°C (96°F), HR: 97 bpm, BP: 131/63 mmHg, RR: 34 breaths per minute, SpO2: 97% on face mask with BIPAP.
- Physical examination: Peripheral vascular assessment not done, skin not assessed, neurologic assessment not done.
- Labs: K+ 3.3 mEq/L, Cr 0.7 mg/dL, WBC 8.1 K/uL, Hct 24%, Plt 379 K/uL, etc.
- Imaging: Chest X-ray shows right-sided effusion and clearing of left lung due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Malnutrition: The patient is unable to tolerate tube feeds and is being started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by the effusion on chest X-ray. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.
3. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and aortic stenosis. He was admitted with severe septic shock and respiratory failure, but is currently stable on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP). The patient has completed a course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and has resolved acute renal failure (ARF). His cardiac function is compromised due to severe aortic stenosis and CAD s/p CABG, with an ejection fraction of 40%. The patient also has malnutrition, pulmonary edema, altered mental status, cardiogenic shock, ineffective coping, bradycardia, respiratory failure, severe sepsis, and risk for aspiration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation due to severe sepsis and aortic stenosis.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's compromised cardiac function due to severe aortic stenosis and CAD s/p CABG may lead to cardiogenic shock, which can result in poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced severe sepsis, and there is a risk of recurrence, especially if infection control measures are not maintained.

   24 Hour Events:
   patient was not tolerating being off the bipap yesterday. Started
   enalaprilat IV to see if afterload reduction would help with forward
   flow along with diuresis, and this seemed to work well - she spent 2.5
   hours off bipap in the afternoon.
   Overnight, the patient was off bipap for 25 minutes before respiratory
   distress. On exam, she had copious upper airway secretions and
   crackles. She was nasotracheal suctioned and given 1mg morphine, 20mg
   IV lasix and an extra dose of enalaprilat with good effect, and she
   stayed off bipap until this morning (still off) - total of 4.5 hours.
   Diuresing well.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and intolerance to being off bipap. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including malnutrition, pulmonary edema, aortic stenosis, altered mental status (not delirium), cardiogenic shock, ineffective coping, bradycardia, respiratory failure (acute), sepsis (severe with organ dysfunction), and an inability to protect the airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, cough).

The patient is currently receiving various treatments in the ICU, including nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, cardiac complications due to aortic stenosis, electrolyte and fluid disorders, further deterioration of mental status, and the risk of aspiration due to the inability to protect the airway."

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and is now experiencing respiratory failure.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was not tolerating being off the bipap yesterday, so enalaprilat IV was started to see if afterload reduction would help with forward flow along with diuresis. This seemed to work well, and the patient spent 2.5 hours off bipap in the afternoon.
- Overnight, the patient was off bipap for 25 minutes before experiencing respiratory distress. She had copious upper airway secretions and crackles. She was nasotracheal suctioned and given 1mg morphine, 20mg IV lasix, and an extra dose of enalaprilat with good effect. She stayed off bipap until this morning (still off) - total of 4.5 hours.
- She is diuresing well.
- Sputum sent for culture.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Vancomycin/Zosyn (completed).
- Infusions: Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), Morphine Sulfate, Furosemide (Lasix).
- Other medications: Enalaprilat, mucomyst, TPN.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and is now experiencing respiratory failure. She is currently on BIPAP support and has been weaned off it intermittently with the help of enalaprilat, which aids in forward flow and diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to tolerate increased ventilation off of BIPAP suggests a high risk of respiratory failure due to severe aortic stenosis and the inability to adequately clear secretions.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's risk of aspiration is increased due to her severe Alzheimer's dementia and the use of BIPAP, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia if proper airway protection measures are not taken.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and severe illness increase the risk of developing DVT, which could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if left untreated.

5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient's critical condition and septic shock state may predispose her to stress ul"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yof with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock now with respiratory
   failure
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS) - [**3-1**] to severe AS and inability to
   tolerate increased VR off of Bipap. Enalaprilat seemed to increase her
   forward flow and aided in continued diuresis and allowed her to be off
   bipap almost 6 hours overnight. That being said, she seems to be
   plugging on the left.
   - BIPAP as needed
   - continue enalaprilat Q6H
   - check CXR this morning
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning
   - continue to run negative with lasix as tolerated by BP
   - -500 negative today
   - mucomyst to help with secretions; starting unasyn for ?sinusitis
   - hold tube feeds and start TPN given risk of aspiration with BIPAP
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%; Aortic Stenosis
   Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75
    # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. Unable to initiate PO meds at this
   time.
    # Hypothyroidism
  cont synthroid
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, holding TF.  Failed S&S. TPN as
   above, nutrition consult
   # Prophylaxis: SQ Hep, ppi
   # Access: PICC started on [**3-12**]
    # Code: DNR/DNI
 discussed with son
 not to re-intubate after
   extubation. Ok with bipap as necessary, but given difficulty with
   secretions and hemodynamics, patient has been unable to tolerate
   prolonged amounts of time of Bipap. Will readdress goals of care
   tonight with family.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 1277**] in a little more lethargic today
   .vanco started yesterday given open abd wounds and she now has yeast in
   ascitic fluid from that site. caspogungin also started today pending
   repeat paracentesis.
   Exam notable for deep jaundice and mild asterixis. She has dry MM with
   pooling of oral secretions and weak gag.  Tm 101.3 104/32  HR70 RR
   14-18 with sats of 96%  on 4 lpm .she has oozing wounds from belly
   taps.  she is oriented to name and place today.
   Labs notable for WBC 7.7K, hct of 33.7, K of 3.1 and creat of 3.5, BUN
   is 52 and Na of 149. CXR shows small lung volumes. She is 900 cc
   Positive overnight.
   While she has reamined extubated, she remains a high aspiration risk.
   She has concerns of ongoing sepsis ( fungal, SBP, apsiration as
   sources). I concur with plans to to tap belly with USG guidance by IR
   and start broad Abx including caspofungin. She will need HD today but
   will not take fluid off. Also free water to be repleted today. Tube
   feeds will be started slowly later today if residuals not high. TPN
   only to be started if fungal cultures are negative. ID input today
   given complexities and transplant situation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and is now experiencing respiratory failure. She has been on BiPAP support but has not tolerated it well. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 118/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, alertness, skin breakdown on the face, clear but copious upper airway secretions, reduced air movement on the left side, rhonchi, and crackles on the right side. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including respiratory failure, CAD s/p CABG, severe Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, and fungal infection in the ascitic fluid.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to tolerate BiPAP suggests ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to increased secretions, severe aortic stenosis, or aspiration risk.
2. Severe Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of less than 0.8 cm2 and a gradient of 75 mmHg indicates"

   24 Hour Events:
   patient was not tolerating being off the bipap yesterday. Started
   enalaprilat IV to see if afterload reduction would help with forward
   flow along with diuresis, and this seemed to work well - she spent 2.5
   hours off bipap in the afternoon.
   Overnight, the patient was off bipap for 25 minutes before respiratory
   distress. On exam, she had copious upper airway secretions and
   crackles. She was nasotracheal suctioned and given 1mg morphine, 20mg
   IV lasix and an extra dose of enalaprilat with good effect, and she
   stayed off bipap until this morning (still off) - total of 4.5 hours.
   Diuresing well.
   Sputum sent for culture.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yof with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock now with respiratory
   failure
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS) - [**3-1**] to severe AS and inability to
   tolerate increased VR off of Bipap. Enalaprilat seemed to increase her
   forward flow and aided in continued diuresis and allowed her to be off
   bipap almost 6 hours overnight. That being said, she seems to be
   plugging on the left.
   - BIPAP as needed
   - continue enalaprilat Q6H
   - check CXR this morning
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning
   - continue to run negative with lasix as tolerated by BP
   - -500 negative today
   - mucomyst to help with secretions; starting unasyn for ?sinusitis
   - hold tube feeds and start TPN given risk of aspiration with BIPAP
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%; Aortic Stenosis
   Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75
    # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. Unable to initiate PO meds at this
   time.
    # Hypothyroidism
  cont synthroid
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, holding TF.  Failed S&S. TPN as
   above, nutrition consult
   # Prophylaxis: SQ Hep, ppi
   # Access: PICC started on [**3-12**]
    # Code: DNR/DNI
 discussed with son
 not to re-intubate after
   extubation. Ok with bipap as necessary, but given difficulty with
   secretions and hemodynamics, patient has been unable to tolerate
   prolonged amounts of time of Bipap. Will readdress goals of care
   tonight with family.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 1277**] in a little more lethargic today
   .vanco started yesterday given open abd wounds and she now has yeast in
   ascitic fluid from that site. caspogungin also started today pending
   repeat paracentesis.
   Exam notable for deep jaundice and mild asterixis. She has dry MM with
   pooling of oral secretions and weak gag.  Tm 101.3 104/32  HR70 RR
   14-18 with sats of 96%  on 4 lpm .she has oozing wounds from belly
   taps.  she is oriented to name and place today.
   Labs notable for WBC 7.7K, hct of 33.7, K of 3.1 and creat of 3.5, BUN
   is 52 and Na of 149. CXR shows small lung volumes. She is 900 cc
   Positive overnight.
   While she has reamined extubated, she remains a high aspiration risk.
   She has concerns of ongoing sepsis ( fungal, SBP, apsiration as
   sources). I concur with plans to to tap belly with USG guidance by IR
   and start broad Abx including caspofungin. She will need HD today but
   will not take fluid off. Also free water to be repleted today. Tube
   feeds will be started slowly later today if residuals not high. TPN
   only to be started if fungal cultures are negative. ID input today
   given complexities and transplant situation.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname **] has continued problems with
   secretion clearance. She need NT suctioining QS and BiPAP for
   ventilatory support. She has responded well to enalaprilat IV with
   better effective diuresis ( 900cc) and increased time off bipap on [**3-14**]
   ( 6 hrs). However, secretion output is still a problem and she has
   developed atelectasis of left lung on exam today
   Exam notable for Tm [**2134-3-31**] BP 102- 117/44 HR 80-90 RR 26 with sats of
   96% on NRB . She has audible rales in all lung fields and expiratory
   wheezing at right base. She has egophony over entire left lung
   Labs notable for WBC 5.8 K, HCT of 25.2 , K+3.8 , Cr 0.7 . CXR with
   right sided effuision , msall lung volume and increasing opacifaction
   of left lung
   Agree with plan to gently diurese, use BiPAP and nebs and NT suctioning
   during daytime. TPN ongoing. We will also use NT suctioning off BiPAP,
   mucomyst nebs and positional assist to help with secretions. It has
   been difficult for her to stay off biPAP for any length of time and
   family do not wish for this to continue indefinitely. If she does not
   have an improvement clinically in next 24 hrs, will will recommedn
   institution of comfort measures. BiPAP will then be D/C'd. if she does
   improve, She may very well need therapeutic tap of Rt effusion if this
   does not resolve with lasix/ enalaprilrat . Sons updated
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and now presents with respiratory failure.

The patient has been unable to tolerate prolonged periods off of BiPAP, a type of respiratory support. Enalaprilat, an IV medication, has been started to improve forward flow and aid in diuresis. The patient has copious upper airway secretions and crackles in her lungs, indicating possible aspiration risk. She has been given morphine and lasix, and an extra dose of enalaprilat was administered with good effect. The patient is still off BiPAP at the time of the note.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
- Heart rate: 77 bpm (74-104 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 118/41 mmHg (61-138/82-94 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (19-37 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on high-flow nasal cannula

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 10.9 K/uL (11.4 K/uL - 9.0 K/uL)
- Hematocrit: 25.3% (99.0% - 26.3%)
- Platelet count: 333 K/uL (414 K/uL - 402 K/uL)
- Creatinine: 0"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), and aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and now presents with respiratory failure. The patient has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and zosyn for treatment of infection but remains unable to tolerate long periods off non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is multifactorial and secondary to severe aortic stenosis, chronic aspiration, and mucous plugging.

2. Sinusitis: The patient has been started on Unasyn for acute sinusitis.

3. Coronary Artery Disease post CABG: The patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG, but ischemia has been ruled out with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. However, she is unable to take aspirin as she is currently NPO.

4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area less than 0.8cm2 and a gradient of 75. BP control and gentle diuresis are recommended.

5. Severe Alzheimer's Dementia: The patient has severe Alzheimer's dementia, and she is unable to resume oral medications (Namenda and Galantamine) at"

   be
   bilateral effusions, right greater than left and some patchy alveolar
   edema in
   the right upper lobe but overall the aeration is improved.
   IMPRESSION: Continued but improved CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   84 yof with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG and
   aortic stenosis admitted with severe septic shock now with respiratory
   failure
   # Respiratory Failure (non ARDS) - [**3-1**] to severe AS and inability to
   tolerate increased VR off of Bipap. Enalaprilat seemed to increase her
   forward flow and aided in continued diuresis and allowed her to be off
   bipap almost 6 hours overnight. That being said, she seems to be
   plugging on the left.
   - BIPAP as needed
   - continue enalaprilat Q6H
   - check CXR this morning
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning
   - continue to run negative with lasix as tolerated by BP
   - -500 negative today
   - mucomyst to help with secretions; starting unasyn for ?sinusitis
   - hold tube feeds and start TPN given risk of aspiration with BIPAP
   # CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia as above. EF 40%; Aortic Stenosis
   Severe AS with AV area <0.8cm2, gradient 75
    # Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and
   says yes or no to any questions. Unable to initiate PO meds at this
   time.
    # Hypothyroidism
  cont synthroid
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO, holding TF.  Failed S&S. TPN as
   above, nutrition consult
   # Prophylaxis: SQ Hep, ppi
   # Access: PICC started on [**3-12**]
    # Code: DNR/DNI
 discussed with son
 not to re-intubate after
   extubation. Ok with bipap as necessary, but given difficulty with
   secretions and hemodynamics, patient has been unable to tolerate
   prolonged amounts of time of Bipap. Will readdress goals of care
   tonight with family.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of severe Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted with severe septic shock and is now experiencing respiratory failure.

The patient has been placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) using a BiPAP mask due to respiratory failure. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) because of the risk of aspiration with BiPAP, and tube feeds have been held. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/45 mmHg to 148/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on BiPAP.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin at 8.6 g/dL, elevated lactate levels at 1.8 mmol/L, and normal kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Imaging shows bilateral effusions, more prominent on the right side, and patchy alveolar edema in the right upper lobe, indicating ongoing congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's clinical impression remains continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been placed on non-invasive ventilation due to pulmonary edema. He has a history of aortic stenosis, altered mental status, and malnutrition. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (90/36 mmHg) and tachycardia (RR: 23 inspirations per minute). The patient is receiving multiple medications including morphine sulfate, furosemide, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for non-invasive ventilation indicate a potential respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 455 K/uL suggests an infection, which can lead to sepsis, especially considering the patient's altered mental status and the presence of organ dysfunction.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia could be indicative of cardiogenic shock, particularly in the context of aortic stenosis.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition increases the risk of complications such as poor wound healing, infections, and impaired immune function.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4), which can affect various bodily functions."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, who is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure following pneumonia. She has severe aortic stenosis and is not a candidate for valvuloplasty. The patient requires continuous BiPAP support and is unable to feed orally due to aspiration risk. She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and receiving antibiotics for suspected sinusitis. Diuretics are being continued, and the need to readdress goals of care with the family is mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has acute respiratory failure and there is a risk of further respiratory complications due to ongoing aspiration.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and potential organ failure.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which can result in poor tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia.
4. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, as indicated by her altered mental status and inability to feed orally. Malnutrition can weaken the immune system and delay wound healing.
5. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has pulmonary edema, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of further respiratory complications.
6. Airway Inability: The patient has an inability to protect her airway, increasing the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and resolved sepsis. She is currently in the ICU and has been managed by a team of healthcare professionals. The patient has a history of right bundle branch block, and her current vital signs include a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 54/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 54%. The patient is receiving morphine and lorazepam infusions for pain and agitation management. She is also on Lasix for diuresis and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The patient's laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 455 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 130 mg/dL, and a decreased albumin level of 2.8 g/dL. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears comfortable but has agonal respirations, bradycardia, and hypotension. The rest of the examination is deferred since the patient is comfort measures only (CMO). 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is low, and"
