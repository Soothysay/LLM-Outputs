   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2Â°C (99Â°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/71mmHg to 148/87mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 487mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient has undergone several interventions including the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, arterial line, and multi-lumen central venous catheter. The patient is also receiving multiple medications including fentanyl for pain management, famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and various antibiotics such as levofloxacin, vancomycin, and linezolid. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and troponin levels. Other lab values including blood glucose, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests are within normal ranges. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,283mL and output of 2,040mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a positive balance of 1,243mL. The patient's urine output is 1,870mL, and they have received a total of 511mL of fluid through the intravenous route.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the noted allergies to ceftriaxone and oxycodone. The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed in various domains including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and others. 

The patient's respiratory support requirements, fluid status, and laboratory values need close monitoring due to the potential complications associated with respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, and the use of central venous catheters. These complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), fluid overload, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including bilateral thalamic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), cecal perforation, ostomy, abdominal abscess, and recent respiratory distress leading to intubation and ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient has been diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and is being treated with linezolid. The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing respiratory support, hemodynamic monitoring, and multiple lines including an arterial line and multi-lumen central venous catheter. The patient also has a history of abdominal abscess with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Enterococcus, and a superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis. The patient is receiving various prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   ECHO: Very limited image quality. The left atrium is dilated. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and

   is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, who underwent bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle CVAs, right hemicolectomy for perforated cecum, and currently has an intra-abdominal abscess. He experienced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and was intubated on [11-21]. His recent respiratory status has improved, and he is expected to tolerate extubation. He is being treated for MRSA healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), intra-abdominal abscess, and urinary tract infection with Linezolid. The patient also has acute renal failure that is resolving, and his wounds are stable except for a stage III sacral decubitus. His blood glucose levels are labile, and he requires close monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA HCAP PNA: The patient has an active infection with MRSA, which may require prolonged treatment to prevent recurrence.
2. Intra-abdominal abscess: Although the abscess has shown significant improvement, there is still a risk of complications such as recurrent infection or spread of infection to other areas.
3. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by VRE, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
4. SMV Thrombosis: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, which can lead to ischem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU for evaluation and treatment of [diagnosis]. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics and pain management medications. The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate between 93-109 bpm, blood pressure between 90/49-101/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation in the CPAP/PSV mode.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,528 mL and total output of 1,700 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 828 mL. The patient has received a total of 1,300 mL of intravenous fluids and 258 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Blood product transfusion was given, totaling 1,700 mL. Urine output has been good at 1,450 mL.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, suggesting an ongoing infection. Hemoglobin (Hct) levels have decreased from 23.9% to 22.7%, indicating possible bleeding or transfusion. Platelet count (Plt) is within normal range. Renal function tests show slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.3, while liver function tests"

   ECHO: Very limited image quality. The left atrium is dilated. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is
   an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

   ECHO: Very limited image quality. The left atrium is dilated. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is
   an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. There are no

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this this day I examined the patient and was present for the key
   portions of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5809**]
s note
   and agree with the findings and plan of care. I would only add or
   emphasize the following:  The patient was intubated in the setting of a
   cardiac arrest , presumably from hypoxia from mucus plugging.  He has
   been titrated down to minimal ventilatory support and has a clear CXR
   and good RSBI, such that we believe he should be given the chance at
   extubation.  He will need to be followed closely for pulmonary hygiene,
   encouraged to cough, and given mucolytics. His prior stroke may be
   contributing to his less than optimal ability to clear his secretions.
   He is on Linezolid  for a MRSA pneumonia, VRE UTI, and VRE abdominal
   wall abscess.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased oxygen saturation. He was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypotension, fever, and altered mental status. He was extubated but required reintubation due to respiratory failure. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and he has received multiple blood transfusions. He is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was intubated and required reintubation, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status may suggest sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and abnormal chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
6. Nosocomial infection: Given the prolonged"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents. He underwent right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum and developed an acute hypoxic respiratory distress, leading to cardiac arrest. The patient was intubated and diagnosed with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a mucus plug or pneumonia (MRSA sputum). He has shown improvement in secretions over the past 24 hours and is now extubated.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory distress, which was likely caused by a mucus plug or pneumonia. He required intubation but has since improved and was successfully extubated.
2. Hemodynamics s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest and required hemodynamic support. His ejection fraction (EF) was measured at 60% on [11-21], with a troponin level of 0.16. He is currently off pressors with maintained mean arterial pressures (MAPs) between 77-86.
3. MRSA Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HCAP): The patient's sputum culture revealed 4+ coag positive Staphylococcus aureus, indicating a MRSA infection. He was previously treated with vancomycin and levoflo"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, who has undergone bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle CVAs, right hemicolectomy for perforated cecum, and currently has an acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which led to intubation. There is a concern for mucus plug or pneumonia (MRSA sputum). It will be important to continue monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory status.

2. Hemodynamics s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest, resulting in reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. The patient is off pressors with maintained mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 77-86. It will be necessary to continue monitoring the patient's hemodynamics and consider further cardiac evaluation.

3. MRSA HCAP PNA: The patient has an infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the setting of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The patient is currently being treated with linezolid, but it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection or worsening respiratory status.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, who underwent a right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum and developed an intra-abdominal abscess. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and subsequent acute hypoxic respiratory distress. He is currently in the ICU and has been extubated overnight. The patient's current condition includes acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, MRSA healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), diabetes mellitus type II, intra-abdominal abscess, urinary tract infection (UTI) with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ability to maintain oxygenation and ventilation should be closely monitored. Supportive measures such as mucolytics, nebulizations, and chest physical therapy may be required.

2. MRSA HCAP PNA: The patient is at risk of worsening respiratory symptoms or development of antibiotic resistance due to ongoing infection. Monitoring for signs of clinical improvement and adjusting antibiotic therapy as per ID recommendations is necessary.

3. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Adjustments in insulin dosage may be required based on the patient's current condition and dietary intake.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5951**]
s note above and I
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would add that Mr [**Known lastname 3971**]
   has been successfully extubated, but with the help of intensive
   pulmonary hygiene efforts he is coughing up purulent sputum which will
   be cultured today.  We will try to keep him hydrated to improve mucus
   viscosity.  He is awake and  alert but confused, which is far different
   from his post CVA baseline.  This is likely due to his CNS anoxia from
   his arrest, his infections, and his episode of  hypoglycemia and
   hypotension last night.  We will attempt to smooth out glucose control
   and keep his BP and Sats stable, but it may take time for his mentation
   to significantly improve.  For now he needs ICU level of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 55-year-old male with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He underwent right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum and is currently experiencing an acute hypoxic respiratory distress.

2. The patient was extubated overnight and is now able to breathe on his own with the use of a scoop mask. His sputum viscosity is being decreased with mucolytics, and he is being treated for MRSA pneumonia.

3. His blood glucose levels dropped to 30s at 11 pm, likely due to decreased tube feeds and maintaining insulin sensitivity. He is on a sliding scale of humanolog insulin with Lantus 40 units in the morning and 50 units at night.

4. The intra-abdominal abscess is still draining but with smaller amounts. He is being covered with linezolid until 10-14 days after the drain removal, and abscess resolution has been advised by the ID team.

5. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is being covered with linezolid.

6. He has a superior vena cava (SMV) thrombosis with an elevated INR of"

He was previously admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory distress and cardiac arrest. The patient is now extubated and sitting well on 2L NC. He is being treated for MRSA tracheo-bronchitis with linezolid, and his sputum viscosity is being decreased with mucolytics. The patient also has a sacral decubitus wound that is likely stage 4 with increased drainage and a ventral wound that is intact with good granulation. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and previous cardiovascular events. His vital signs are stable, but he has elevated ESR and CRP levels, indicating possible osteomyelitis or infection. The patient requires further evaluation and management for his wounds, including possible plastics consult and imaging."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5951**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would add the following:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3971**] continues to hold his own from a respiratory standpoint,
   coughing well and raising sputum with is growing, not surprisingly
   MRSA.  This MRSA bronchitis continues to be treated with Linezolid.
   His TFs will today be up to full, and we will ask [**Last Name (un) 276**] to assist us
   in the control of this brittle diabetic
s glucoses.  For now we will
   continue NG feedings
   He still has a dense right hemiplegia.  He remains alert, and seems
   less confused than yesterday, but is still quite far off the mark from
   what his sister says is his recent post CVA baseline. I suspect this is
   due to his recent anoxic event, ongoing infection, and wide swings in
   his BS
   His sacral decubitus may well be to the point of causing sacral
   osteomyelitis.  We will ask Plastic Surgery to advise us on what
   further can be done for this.
   We appreciate surgery service following the pt with us and advising
   when to d/c abdominal drain.
   All in all, patient is stable and able to be cared for on the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and previous bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He underwent a right hemicolectomy for a perforated cecum and now presents with an acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but has been extubated and is now sitting well on 2L nasal cannula oxygen with mucolytics to decrease sputum viscosity. He is being treated for MRSA tracheobronchitis with linezolid. 

The patient also has an intra-abdominal abscess, which is being drained, and he is on linezolid for this condition as well. His diabetes mellitus type II is being managed with a sliding scale insulin regimen and Lantus insulin. 

The patient's wounds include a sacral decubitus that is likely stage 4 with increased drainage, and a ventral wound that is intact with good granulation. There are elevated ESR and CRP levels, suggesting the possibility of osteomyelitis. Imaging and plastic surgery consultation are planned.

Other issues include a stable UTI with VRE, SMV thrombosis with an elevated INR, and bilateral thalamic and left cerebral peduncle CVAs that are stable per most recent CT scan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to MR"
