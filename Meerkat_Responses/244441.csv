   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for right sided systolic heart
   failure secondary to left sided diastolic heart failure, presenting
   with hypoxia, NSTEMI in the setting of cough and diarrhea.
   #.Hypoxia: Pt appears to have some evidence of shunting physiology on
   exam and by 02 requirement and in old cath pt known to have PFO.
   Possibly worsened shunting through PFO in the setting of hypovolemia.
   - TTE with bubble study to evaluate PFO
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Rapid respiratory assay for influenza, viral cultures
   - Titrate to O2>94%
   - page Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # Hypotension: On exam the pt appears to be in hypovolemic shock, as
   her hands are cool and cyanotic, her blood pressure is falling and she
   reports frequent diarrhea and vomiting for several days at home. Of
   concern is the report from the ED that pt had melena in ED. The pt has
   a history of a duodenal ulcer as well as [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] there are two reasons
   for the pt to be having GI bleeding currently. In [**Name (NI) 44**] pt had guaiac
   pos stool but not frank melena.  Pt have have resolving ischemic
   colitis secondary to hypotension.
   - T+S
   - PPI IV BID
   - Guaiac all stools
   - follow stool guiacs
   - Bolus with 500 cc NS prn hypotension
   - blood cx, urine cx, stool for c.diff to evaluate for septic causes of
   hypotension although WBC not elevated, no fever
   # NSTEMI: Troponin 0.4 today, which may be elevated in the setting of
   ARF and demand, but still constitutes NSTEMI. No ST changes on EKG, but
   overall decreased voltage.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle CE
   #. ARF: BL Cr 1.1-1.5. Suspect prerenal azotemia secondary to
   dehydration versus ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - Prerenal: check urine lytes and FEUrea (15%)
   - Gentle IVF
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone as BP still low
   # Hypoglycemia: Check thyroid studies. No history of chronic steroids
   so unlikely adrenal insufficiency. ? Insulin resistance.
   - Check LFTs
   - q2h fingersticks with sliding scale insulin/ dextrose
   #.Diarrhea: Possibly from infection or flare of ulcerative colitis.
   - Stool Cx, fecal leuks
   - C.Diff Cx
   #.Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic, likely due to CHF exacerbation and
   diarrhea.
   #.Hypothyroid: [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to hypotension.
   - TSH elevated, T4 normal, likely sick euthyroid or subclinical
   hypothyroid.

   unlikely as the pt does not have any known RF for DVT, is not

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of right-sided systolic heart failure secondary to left-sided diastolic heart failure. She is currently presenting with hypoxia, cough, and diarrhea. The patient's vital signs indicate low blood pressure, high heart rate, and slightly low respiratory rate. She is receiving CPAP support and her oxygen saturation is at 96%. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH level of 7.26, which is below the normal range. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, and troponin T, along with low levels of sodium, potassium, and glucose. The physical examination reveals minimal right basilar crackles, jugular venous pressure (JVP) at 9 cm, and stable pedal edema. There are no signs of interstitial edema on the chest X-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation and symptoms of cough and diarrhea may indicate several possible causes including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF), or viral upper respiratory infection (URI).
2. Hypotension: The patient's falling blood pressure and cool, cyanotic hands suggest hypovolemic shock. Her frequent diarrhea and vomiting, along with a history of duodenal ulcer, could contribute to gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. NSTEMI"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for right sided systolic heart
   failure secondary to left sided diastolic heart failure, presenting
   with hypoxia, NSTEMI in the setting of cough and diarrhea.
   # Right heart failure: Pt with worsening right heart function,
   initially thought to be due to Left diastolic failure. Now with
   significant flow via ASD, TR and decreased flow via [**MD Number(3) 8317**] mod pulm
   HTN.
   - Difficult situation as ASD may be offloading some RV pressure and
   closing ASD may cause worsening function.
   - Also vasodilators risk systemic vasodilatation, and as pt obviously
   preload dependent may worsen situation.
   - Will tbw Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] re plan and prognosis and discuss situation with
   family.
   - continue dopamine to augment inotropy/chronotropy.
   - Cardiac enzymes: CK peaked trending down, Trop still elevated. Likely
   demand ischemia. Less likely myocarditis.
   #.Hypoxia:  Poorly responsive to O2, thus shunt physiology.  TTE with
   significant right to left shunt with intraatrial septal deviation
   plan for TEE today. Based on TEE findings may go on to right heart cath
   for pressure measurement and trial of vasodilators vs float swan in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**].
   - Influenza ruled out.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated while volume and perfusion repleted
   # Hypotension: On exam the pt appears to be in hypovolemic vs septic
   shock
   - Re: hypovolemia: frequent diarrhea and vomiting for several days, ?
   melena, h/o UC and PUD.
   - Re: ? sepsis: hypotensive, bradycardic, hypothermic, leukopenia and
   UA positive.
   - T+S, PPI IV BID, Guaiac all stools
   - small boluses prn
   - continue dopamine for increased CO.
   - blood cx  and urine cx pending but UA positive. Given allergy to
   sulfa, started empiric cipro.
   - Cdiff neg.
   #. ARF: Cr trending up to 3.3 today. Given anuria, suspect ATN
   - no improvement with IVF yest
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone as BP still low
   - no hydro on US.
   - consult renal to be on board if need for RRT arises. Currently no
   indication for RRT
 but if requires, will likely need CVVH given
   hemodynamic instability and dependence on Dopamine.
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated AST but not ALT. Also Alk phos, GGT but
   not bilirubin. Multiple possible causes: congestion secondary to right
   heart failure and TR, PSC due to UC (although previous w/u negative
   with hepatology), etoh induced.
   - will start with repeat RUQ US
   - unclear if function compromised (INR 1.4, Alb ?, no thrombocytopenia
   or megaloblastic anemia) or if findings are due to malnutrition. Could
   consider trial of vit K to eval for response and rule in/out liver
   cause.
   # ? pneumomediastinum: Moving air well bilaterally, but having short
   SVT with manipulation of CVL.  Placement appropriate, no desaturations
   since line placement. .
   Repeat CXR this AM without evidence of pneumomediastinum or
   pneumothorax.
   # Abdominal pain: Denies today although continues to have frequent
   bowel movements.
   - C diff ruled out.
   - ? resolving ischemic colitis secondary to hypotension.
   - does not seem to be having UC flair, and pain was in RLQ,
   notconsistent with PUD.
   # Hypoglycemia: Check thyroid studies. No history of chronic steroids
   so unlikely adrenal insufficiency. ? Insulin resistance.
   - LFTs with elevated AST, alk phos and GGT.
   - q2h fingersticks with sliding scale insulin/ dextrose
   #.Diarrhea: Possibly from infection or flare of ulcerative colitis.
   - Stool Cx, fecal leuks
   - C.Diff Cx
   #.Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic, likely due to CHF exacerbation and
   diarrhea.
   #.Hypothyroid: [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to hypotension.
   - TSH elevated, T4 normal, likely sick euthyroid or subclinical
   hypothyroid.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Chief Complaint: The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of right-sided systolic heart failure secondary to left-sided diastolic heart failure. She presents with hypoxia, cough, and diarrhea.

2. 24-hour events:
   - An echocardiogram with bubbles was performed, suggesting a significant shunt and indicating atrial septal defect (ASD) rather than patent foramen ovale (PFO).
   - There is worsening right ventricular wall motion, but pulmonary artery (PA) pressure is not significant enough to suspect pulmonary embolism (PE).
   - The patient's condition may be worsening right-sided heart failure or a right ventricular infarction, as evidenced by bradycardia, hypotension, elevated cardiac enzymes, and ECG changes.
   - A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned for the next day to further evaluate the shunt and right heart function.
   - Right heart catheterization may be performed after the TEE to measure pressures and determine if vasodilators or a floating Swan-Ganz catheter should be used.

3. Medical Complications:
   - Right heart failure: The patient's right heart function is worsening, initially thought to be due to left diastolic failure. The significant flow via ASD and tricuspid regurgitation"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for right sided systolic heart
   failure secondary to left sided diastolic heart failure, presenting
   with hypoxia, NSTEMI in the setting of cough and diarrhea.
   #.Hypoxia: Pt appears to have some evidence of shunting physiology on
   exam and by 02 requirement and in old cath pt known to have PFO.
   Possibly worsened shunting through PFO in the setting of hypovolemia.
   - TTE with bubble study to evaluate PFO
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Rapid respiratory assay for influenza, viral cultures
   - Titrate to O2>94%
   - page Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # Hypotension: On exam the pt appears to be in hypovolemic shock, as
   her hands are cool and cyanotic, her blood pressure is falling and she
   reports frequent diarrhea and vomiting for several days at home. Of
   concern is the report from the ED that pt had melena in ED. The pt has
   a history of a duodenal ulcer as well as [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] there are two reasons
   for the pt to be having GI bleeding currently. In [**Name (NI) 44**] pt had guaiac
   pos stool but not frank melena.  Pt have have resolving ischemic
   colitis secondary to hypotension.
   - T+S
   - PPI IV BID
   - Guaiac all stools
   - follow stool guiacs
   - Bolus with 500 cc NS prn hypotension
   - blood cx, urine cx, stool for c.diff to evaluate for septic causes of
   hypotension although WBC not elevated, no fever
   # NSTEMI: Troponin 0.4 today, which may be elevated in the setting of
   ARF and demand, but still constitutes NSTEMI. No ST changes on EKG, but
   overall decreased voltage.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle CE
   #. ARF: BL Cr 1.1-1.5. Suspect prerenal azotemia secondary to
   dehydration versus ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - Prerenal: check urine lytes and FEUrea (15%)
   - Gentle IVF
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone as BP still low
   # Hypoglycemia: Check thyroid studies. No history of chronic steroids
   so unlikely adrenal insufficiency. ? Insulin resistance.
   - Check LFTs
   - q2h fingersticks with sliding scale insulin/ dextrose
   #.Diarrhea: Possibly from infection or flare of ulcerative colitis.
   - Stool Cx, fecal leuks
   - C.Diff Cx
   #.Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic, likely due to CHF exacerbation and
   diarrhea.
   #.Hypothyroid: [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to hypotension.
   - TSH elevated, T4 normal, likely sick euthyroid or subclinical
   hypothyroid.

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of right-sided systolic heart failure secondary to left-sided diastolic heart failure. She presents with hypoxia, NSTEMI, cough, and diarrhea. The patient has been diagnosed with a significant shunt, likely due to an atrial septal defect (ASD) rather than a patent foramen ovale (PFO), as well as worsening right ventricular wall motion but without significant pulmonary artery pressure to suggest pulmonary embolism (PE). There are concerns about worsening right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) or right myocardial infarction (MI) in the setting of bradycardia, hypotension, and elevated cardiac enzymes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 34.8°C (94.7°F), heart rate of 79 bpm (with a range of 56-91 bpm), blood pressure of 94/62 mmHg (with a range of 74-149/145 mmHg), respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (with a range of 8-20 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 91%, and irregularly irregular rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation. The patient's physical examination findings include distended external jugular veins, good air movement bilaterally, 1+ lower extremity peripheral edema, cyanotic hands with poor capillary refill, and warm and pale legs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of right-sided systolic heart failure secondary to left-sided diastolic heart failure. She presented with hypoxia, NSTEMI, cough, and diarrhea. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including a significant shunt, worsening right ventricular wall motion, possible ASD rather than PFO, potential worsening R CHF or R infarct, bradycardia, hypotension, elevated cardiac enzymes, renal failure, anuria, hypoglycemia, diarrhea, hyponatremia, and hypothyroidism.

Medical Complications:
1. Significant shunt: The patient has a concerning for significant shunt with intra-atrial septal deviation. This indicates an abnormal communication between the right and left atria, which can lead to mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, causing hypoxia.
2. Worsening right ventricular wall motion: The patient shows signs of compromised right ventricular function, which can be indicative of a right-sided heart attack or ischemia.
3. NSTEMI: The patient experienced an acute coronary syndrome, specifically non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. This is suggested by elevated cardiac enzymes and the presence of chest pain.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to hypovolemia due to frequent diarrhea and vomiting, or septic shock due to an infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of dilated right-sided systolic heart failure and diastolic left-sided heart failure. She presented with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including right heart failure, hypotension, hypoxia, acute renal failure (ARF), metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, liver function test abnormalities, and possible hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right Heart Failure: The patient has poor right heart function, a markedly dilated right ventricle (RV), and right atrium (RA). There is also a significant right-to-left shunt via a large patent foramen ovale (PFO) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). This situation may lead to further complications such as worsening hypoxia and RV pressure overload.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely secondary to known left-sided heart failure, in the setting of volume depletion and myocardial ischemia/infarction. Monitoring and managing the patient's fluid status and blood pressure will be important to prevent further complications.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is poorly responsive to oxygen therapy due to shunt physiology. Improving the patient's hemodynamics and addressing the underlying cause of the shunt are crucial for improving oxygenation.

4. Acute Renal Failure (AR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of dilated right-sided systolic heart failure and diastolic left-sided heart failure. She presented with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. The patient has been diagnosed with right heart failure, hypotension, hypoxia, acute kidney injury (ARF), metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, liver function test abnormalities, and a possible thyroid issue.

Potential medical complications:
1. Right heart failure: The patient's poor right heart function, markedly dilated right ventricle (RV), and significant right-to-left shunt via a large patent foramen ovale (PFO) along with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) may lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and potential complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening hypoxia.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to known left-sided heart failure in the setting of volume depletion and myocardial ischemia/infarction. If not managed appropriately, it could result in organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is poorly responsive to oxygen therapy due to shunt physiology. Improper management may lead to worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress.

4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguric urine output suggest acute kidney injury. If not addressed, it"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided systolic
   heart failure secondary and diastolic left sided heart failure,
   presenting with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea.
   # Right heart failure: Pt with poor R heart function, markedly dilated
   RV and RA. Now with significant R->L shunt via large PFO, as well as
   TR. Difficult situation as PFO may be offloading some RV pressure but
   leading to significant hypoxia.
   - Appreciate cardiology recommednations.
   - Avoid significant systemic vasodilatation
   - Plan for R heart cath next week and consideration of pulmonary
   dilators
   - continue dopamine to augment inotropy/chronotropy.
   - Cardiac enzymes: CK peaked trending down, Trop still elevated. Likely
   demand ischemia.
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to known L sided heart failure, in the
   setting of volume depletion, myocardial ishemia/infarction. Patient was
   initially volume depleted, now appear slightly volume overloaded by
   exam.
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated to maintain SBP>80 provided patient is
   asymptomatic
   - Fluid restrict with goal for euvolemia.
   #.Hypoxia:  Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now
   improving with stabilization of hemodynamics
   - wean oxygen as tolerated while volume and perfusion repleted
   #. ARF: Cr peaked at 3.4, now 3.2 today. Increasing urine output, now
   oliguric. Likely ATN given poor perfusion on admission.
   -Appreciate renal recommendations
   -Follow Creatinine and urine output.
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone until improvement in renal function
   - if improvement does not continue consider workup for glomerular
   etiology given proteinuria and hematuria.
   #. Gap acidosis: Likely due to ARF and organic anion accumulation.
   Continue to follow as renal function improves.
   #.Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic, likely due to CHF exacerbation and
   diarrhea.
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated AST but not ALT. Also Alk phos, GGT but
   not bilirubin. Liver US shows no pathology. Multiple possible causes:
   congestion secondary to right heart failure and TR, etoh induced.
   - follow
   - unclear if function compromised (INR 1.4, Alb ?, no thrombocytopenia
   or megaloblastic anemia) or if findings are due to malnutrition. Could
   consider trial of vit K to eval for response and rule in/out liver
   cause.
   #.Diarrhea: Now improved. Possibly from infection or flare of
   ulcerative colitis.
   #.Hypothyroid: [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to hypotension.
   - TSH elevated, T4 normal, likely sick euthyroid or subclinical
   hypothyroid.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided systolic
   heart failure secondary and diastolic left sided heart failure,
   presenting with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea.
   Presumed pathophysiology: Diastolic left heart failure with secondary
   pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.  In setting of volume
   depletion, left sided pressures dropped more than right, allowing for
   increased shunting via dilated PFO. Now improved with volume repletion.
   Plan: Right heart cath to evaluate for safety and response to
   vasodilators
 concern of pulmonary edema given left heart failure. If
   able to lower pulmonary pressures, ultimately may undergo PFO closure.
 HYPOXEMIA- Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now
   improving with stabilization of hemodynamics
   - wean oxygen as tolerated while volume and perfusion repleted
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - Likely secondary to known L sided heart
   failure, in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial
   ishemia/infarction. Patient was initially volume depleted, now appear
   total body overloaded by exam, although intravascular volume may still
   be low.
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated to maintain SBP>80 provided patient is
   asymptomatic
   - Fluid restrict with goal for euvolemia.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Pt with poor R heart
   function, markedly dilated RV and RA. Now with significant R->L shunt
   via large PFO, as well as TR. Difficult situation as PFO may be
   offloading some RV pressure but leading to significant hypoxia.
   - Appreciate cardiology recommednations.
   - Avoid significant systemic vasodilatation
   - Plan for R heart cath next week and trial of NO to access pt
   ability to tolerate pulmonary vasodilators, in hopes of eventually
   closing PFO.
   - wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Cardiac enzymes: CK peaked trending down, Trop still elevated. Likely
   demand ischemia.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr peaked at 3.4, now
   2.8 today. Increasing urine output, now oliguric. Likely ATN given poor
   perfusion on admission.
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Follow Creatinine and urine output.
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone until improvement in renal function
   - Workup for glomerular etiology given proteinuria and hematuria is
   pending, though less likely as continues to improve.
   #.Hyponatremia: Stable/slightly worse since admission. Hypervolemic,
   likely due to CHF exacerbation and diarrhea.
   - Will continue to monitor as renal function improves and pt self
   diuresis.
   - stop salt restriction in diet.
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated AST but not ALT. Also Alk phos, GGT but
   not bilirubin. Liver US shows no pathology. Multiple possible causes:
   congestion secondary to right heart failure and TR, etoh induced. PSC
   ruled out with neg AMA
   - unclear if function compromised (INR 1.4, Alb ?, no thrombocytopenia
   or megaloblastic anemia) or if findings are due to malnutrition. Could
   consider trial of vit K to eval for response and rule in/out liver
   cause.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of dilated right-sided systolic heart failure secondary and diastolic left-sided heart failure. She presented with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. The presumed pathophysiology is diastolic left heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. In the setting of volume depletion, left-sided pressures dropped more than right, allowing for increased shunting via a dilated patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient has shown improvement with volume repletion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: Given the patient's left heart failure, there is a concern for pulmonary edema. Right heart catheterization may be planned to evaluate for safety and response to vasodilators. If pulmonary pressures can be lowered, the patient may undergo PFO closure.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology. It is improving with stabilization of hemodynamics. Oxygen should be weaned as tolerated while volume and perfusion are replenished.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to known left-sided heart failure in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial ischemia/infarction. Dopamine should be weaned as tolerated to maintain systolic blood pressure >80 mmHg provided the patient is asymptomatic. Fluid restriction with the"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided systolic
   heart failure secondary and diastolic left sided heart failure,
   presenting with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea.
 HYPOXEMIA- Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now
   improving with stabilization of hemodynamics
   - wean oxygen as tolerated while volume and perfusion repleted
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - Likely secondary to known L sided heart
   failure, in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial
   ishemia/infarction. Patient was initially volume depleted, now appear
   total body overloaded by exam, although intravascular volume may still
   be low.
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated to maintain SBP>80 provided patient is
   asymptomatic
   - Fluid restrict with goal for euvolemia.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Pt with poor R heart
   function, markedly dilated RV and RA. Now with significant R->L shunt
   via large PFO, as well as TR. Difficult situation as PFO may be
   offloading some RV pressure but leading to significant hypoxia.
   - Appreciate cardiology recommednations.
   - Avoid significant systemic vasodilatation
   - Plan for R heart cath next week and trial of pulmonary dilators
   - wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Cardiac enzymes: CK peaked trending down, Trop still elevated. Likely
   demand ischemia.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr peaked at 3.4, now
   2.8 today. Increasing urine output, now oliguric. Likely ATN given poor
   perfusion on admission.
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Follow Creatinine and urine output.
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone until improvement in renal function
   - Workup for glomerular etiology given proteinuria and hematuria is
   pending, though less likely as continues to improve.
   #.Hyponatremia: Stable/slightly worse since admission. Hypervolemic,
   likely due to CHF exacerbation and diarrhea.
   - Will continue to monitor as renal function improves and pt self
   diuresis.
   - stop salt restriction in diet.
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated AST but not ALT. Also Alk phos, GGT but
   not bilirubin. Liver US shows no pathology. Multiple possible causes:
   congestion secondary to right heart failure and TR, etoh induced. PSC
   ruled out with neg AMA
   - unclear if function compromised (INR 1.4, Alb ?, no thrombocytopenia
   or megaloblastic anemia) or if findings are due to malnutrition. Could
   consider trial of vit K to eval for response and rule in/out liver

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history significant for dilated right-sided systolic heart failure and diastolic left-sided heart failure. She presents with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 91/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation, and her JVP is at 16cm with pulsatile rhythm. Physical examination reveals a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border that does not radiate, clear lung fields, soft non-tender nondistended abdomen, and 2+ pitting edema in lower extremities bilaterally. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, mildly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows no significant pathology. 

Based on the assessment and plan, the patient has several medical complications. These include hypoxemia, poorly responsive to oxygen due to shunt physiology but improving with stabilization of hemodynamics. It is recommended to wean oxygen as tolerated while volume and perfusion are replenished. The patient also has hypotension likely secondary to known left-sided heart failure, in the setting of volume depletion and myocardial ischemia/infarction. Dopamine should be weaned"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided systolic
   heart failure and diastolic left sided heart failure, presenting with
   hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. Presumed
   pathophysiology: Diastolic left heart failure with secondary pulmonary
   hypertension and right heart failure.  In setting of volume depletion,
   left sided pressures dropped more than right, allowing for increased
   shunting via dilated PFO. Now improved with volume repletion.
   Plan: Right heart cath to evaluate for safety and response to
   vasodilators
 concern of pulmonary edema given left heart failure. If
   able to lower pulmonary pressures, ultimately may undergo PFO closure.
 HYPOXEMIA- Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now
   improving with stabilization of hemodynamics.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - Likely secondary to known L sided heart
   failure, in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial
   ishemia/infarction. Patient was initially volume depleted, now appear
   total body overloaded by exam, although intravascular volume may still
   be low. Now autodiuresing with improvement of kidney function. Off
   dopamine and maintaining BP.
   - Fluid restrict with goal for euvolemia.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Pt with poor R heart
   function, markedly dilated RV and RA. Now with significant R->L shunt
   via large PFO, as well as TR, appearing to be improving with
   improvement of volume status and presumed decrease shunting.
   - Appreciate cardiology recommednations.
   - Avoid significant systemic vasodilatation
   - Plan for R heart cath tomorrow and trial of NO to access pt
s ability
   to tolerate pulmonary vasodilators, in hopes of eventually closing PFO.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr peaked at 3.4, now
   2.2 today. Increasing urine output. Likely ATN given poor perfusion on
   admission.
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Follow Creatinine and urine output.
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone until improvement in renal function
   - Workup for glomerular etiology given proteinuria and hematuria is
   pending, though less likely as continues to improve.
   #.Hyponatremia: Stable/slightly worse since admission. Hypervolemic,
   likely due to CHF exacerbation and diarrhea.
   - Will continue to monitor as renal function improves and pt self

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of dilated right-sided systolic heart failure and diastolic left-sided heart failure. She presented with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. The presumed pathophysiology is diastolic left heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. In the setting of volume depletion, left-sided pressures dropped more than right, allowing for increased shunting via a dilated patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient has been improving with volume repletion.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: Given the patient's left heart failure, there is a concern about pulmonary edema. If the patient is able to lower pulmonary pressures, she may undergo PFO closure.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is poorly responsive to oxygen therapy due to shunt physiology. However, it is improving with stabilization of hemodynamics.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to known left-sided heart failure in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial ischemia/infarction. The patient was initially volume depleted but now appears to be total body overloaded by exam, although intravascular volume may still be low. She is autodiuresing with improvement of kidney function and off dopamine, maintaining blood pressure.

4. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided systolic
   heart failure and diastolic left sided heart failure, presenting with
   hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. Presumed
   pathophysiology: Diastolic left heart failure with secondary pulmonary
   hypertension and right heart failure.  In setting of volume depletion,
   left sided pressures dropped more than right, allowing for increased
   shunting via dilated PFO. Now improved with volume repletion.
   Plan: Right heart cath to evaluate for safety and response to
   vasodilators
 concern of pulmonary edema given left heart failure. If
   able to lower pulmonary pressures, ultimately may undergo PFO closure.
 HYPOXEMIA- Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now
   improving with stabilization of hemodynamics.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - Likely secondary to known L sided heart
   failure, in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial
   ishemia/infarction. Patient was initially volume depleted, now appear
   total body overloaded by exam, although intravascular volume may still
   be low. Now autodiuresing with improvement of kidney function. Off
   dopamine and maintaining BP.
   - Fluid restrict with goal for euvolemia.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Pt with poor R heart
   function, markedly dilated RV and RA. Now with significant R->L shunt
   via large PFO, as well as TR, appearing to be improving with
   improvement of volume status and presumed decrease shunting.
   - Appreciate cardiology recommednations.
   - Avoid significant systemic vasodilatation
   - Plan for R heart cath tomorrow and trial of NO to access pt
s ability
   to tolerate pulmonary vasodilators, in hopes of eventually closing PFO.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr peaked at 3.4, now
   2.2 today. Increasing urine output. Likely ATN given poor perfusion on
   admission.
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Follow Creatinine and urine output.
   -Hold mesalamine
   -Mucomyst in preparation for R heart cath
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone until improvement in renal function
   - Workup for glomerular etiology given proteinuria and hematuria is
   pending, though less likely as continues to improve.
   #.Hyponatremia: Stable/slightly worse since admission. Hypervolemic,
   likely due to CHF exacerbation and diarrhea.
   - Will continue to monitor as renal function improves and pt self
   diuresis.
   - stop salt restriction in diet.
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated AST but not ALT. Also Alk phos, GGT but
   not bilirubin. Liver US shows no pathology. Multiple possible causes:
   congestion secondary to right heart failure and TR, etoh induced. PSC
   ruled out with neg AMA. Labs now improving.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of dilated right-sided systolic heart failure and diastolic left-sided heart failure. She presented with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. 

The patient has been weaned off dopamine and oxygen, and is currently on several medications including pantoprazole, insulin sliding scale, Tylenol prn, mesalamine, albuterol prn, Flagyl topical gel prn, miconazole cream prn, ferrous sulfate, percocet q6 prn, folic acid, gabapentin, and pantoprazole IV q12.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/76 mmHg to 87/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is also on atrial fibrillation, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 44 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.1 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 33.5%, platelet count (Plt) of 194 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 3.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 106 mg/dL, and sodium of 131 mEq/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Diastolic left heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure, resulting in increased shunting via a dilated patent foramen ovale (PFO). Now improved with volume repletion.
   Plan: Right heart cath to evaluate for safety and response to vasodilators, concern of pulmonary edema given left heart failure. If able to lower pulmonary pressures, ultimately may undergo PFO closure.
2. HYPOXEMIA - Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now improving with stabilization of hemodynamics.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided systolic
   heart failure and diastolic left sided heart failure, presenting with
   hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. Presumed
   pathophysiology: Diastolic left heart failure with secondary pulmonary
   hypertension and right heart failure.  In setting of volume depletion,
   left sided pressures dropped more than right, allowing for increased
   shunting via dilated PFO. Now improved with volume repletion.
   Plan: Right heart cath to evaluate for safety and response to
   vasodilators
 concern of pulmonary edema given left heart failure. If
   able to lower pulmonary pressures, ultimately may undergo PFO closure.
 HYPOXEMIA- Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now
   improving with stabilization of hemodynamics.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - Likely secondary to known L sided heart
   failure, in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial
   ishemia/infarction. Patient was initially volume depleted, now appear
   total body overloaded by exam, although intravascular volume may still
   be low. Now autodiuresing with improvement of kidney function. Off
   dopamine and maintaining BP.
   - Fluid restrict with goal for euvolemia.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Pt with poor R heart
   function, markedly dilated RV and RA. Now with significant R->L shunt
   via large PFO, as well as TR, appearing to be improving with
   improvement of volume status and presumed decrease shunting.
   - Appreciate cardiology recommednations.
   - Avoid significant systemic vasodilatation
   - Plan for R heart cath tomorrow and trial of NO to access pt
s ability
   to tolerate pulmonary vasodilators, in hopes of eventually closing PFO.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr peaked at 3.4, now
   2.2 today. Increasing urine output. Likely ATN given poor perfusion on
   admission.
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Follow Creatinine and urine output.
   - Hold mesalamine
   - Mucomyst in preparation for R heart cath for possible dye load.
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone until improvement in renal function
   - Workup for glomerular etiology given proteinuria and hematuria is
   pending, though less likely as continues to improve.

The patient initially had volume depletion, but now appears to be overloaded by examination, although intravascular volume may still be low. She is autodiuresing with improvement of kidney function. The patient has been weaned off dopamine and oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: Given the patient's left-sided heart failure, there is a concern for pulmonary edema. Right heart catheterization may be planned to evaluate for safety and response to vasodilators. If able to lower pulmonary pressures, the patient may undergo PFO closure.

   pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.  In setting of volume
   depletion, left sided pressures dropped more than right, allowing for
   increased shunting via dilated PFO. Now improved with volume repletion.
   Plan: Right heart cath to evaluate for safety and response to
   vasodilators
 concern of pulmonary edema given left heart failure. If
   able to lower pulmonary pressures, ultimately may undergo PFO closure.
 HYPOXEMIA- Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now
   improving with stabilization of hemodynamics.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - Likely secondary to known L sided heart
   failure, in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial
   ishemia/infarction. Patient was initially volume depleted, now appear
   total body overloaded by exam, although intravascular volume may still
   be low. Now off dopamine
   - Fluid restrict with goal for euvolemia.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Pt with poor R heart
   function, markedly dilated RV and RA. Now with significant R->L shunt
   via large PFO, as well as TR. Difficult situation as PFO may be
   offloading some RV pressure but leading to significant hypoxia.
   - Appreciate cardiology recommednations.
   - Avoid significant systemic vasodilatation
   - Plan for R heart cath next week and trial of NO to access pt
   ability to tolerate pulmonary vasodilators, in hopes of eventually
   closing PFO.
   - wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Cardiac enzymes: CK peaked trending down, Trop still elevated. Likely
   demand ischemia.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr peaked at 3.4, now
   2.8 today. Increasing urine output, now oliguric. Likely ATN given poor
   perfusion on admission.
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Follow Creatinine and urine output.
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone until improvement in renal function
   - Workup for glomerular etiology given proteinuria and hematuria is
   pending, though less likely as continues to improve.
   #.Hyponatremia: Stable/slightly worse since admission. Hypervolemic,
   likely due to CHF exacerbation and diarrhea.
   - Will continue to monitor as renal function improves and pt self
   diuresis.
   - stop salt restriction in diet.
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated AST but not ALT. Also Alk phos, GGT but
   not bilirubin. Liver US shows no pathology. Multiple possible causes:
   congestion secondary to right heart failure and TR, etoh induced. PSC
   ruled out with neg AMA
   - unclear if function compromised (INR 1.4, Alb ?, no thrombocytopenia
   or megaloblastic anemia) or if findings are due to malnutrition. Could
   consider trial of vit K to eval for response and rule in/out liver

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of dilated right-sided systolic heart failure and diastolic left-sided heart failure. She presented with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. The presumed pathophysiology involves diastolic left heart failure leading to secondary pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. The patient was initially volume depleted, but now appears to be overloaded by examination, although intravascular volume may still be low. 

The patient has several medical complications including:
1. Hypoxemia - Improving with stabilization of hemodynamics.
2. Hypotension - Likely secondary to known left-sided heart failure and volume depletion.
3. Chronic diastolic heart failure - With markedly dilated right ventricle and right atrium, significant right-to-left shunt via a large patent foramen ovale (PFO), and tricuspid regurgitation.
4. Acute renal failure - Peaking at a creatinine level of 3.4, now improving. Increasing urine output, now oliguric.
5. Liver function test abnormalities - Elevated AST, but not ALT. Also elevated alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, but not bilirubin. Liver ultrasound shows no pathology.
6. Hyponatremia - Stable/slightly worse since admission. Hypervolemic, likely due to CHF exacerbation and diarrhea.
