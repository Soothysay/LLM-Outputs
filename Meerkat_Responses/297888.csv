","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and was admitted to the ICU. Insulin therapy was initiated and blood sugar levels were well controlled. The patient received IV fluids and electrolyte supplementation as needed. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 124/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently not on respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Insulin therapy can lower blood sugar levels too much, resulting in hypoglycemia. Monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial to prevent this complication.
2. Hyperkalemia: Electrolyte imbalances can occur during treatment for DKA. Close monitoring of potassium levels is important to prevent hyperkalemia.
3. Infection: Blood and urine cultures have been taken but are still pending. The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly if they are immunocompromised.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or pharmacological intervention may be necessary.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's risk of developing VAP should be"

","The patient is a 21-year-old female with no significant past medical history but with a strong family history of diabetes presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Her blood sugar level was >600 mg/dL on admission and there were no obvious precipitants. The patient appears to have been experiencing DKA for several weeks. Given her presentation and age, it seems likely that she has type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), although it could also be type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) considering the family history.

The patient is currently in the ICU receiving insulin infusions to manage her blood sugar levels. She is being monitored closely with frequent chemistry checks every 4 hours. Once her blood sugar levels normalize and she can take oral medication, she will be started on a combination of Lantus (long-acting insulin) and Humalog (rapid-acting insulin). The insulin infusion will be discontinued after one hour.

Additional tests have been ordered including HgA1c, C-peptide, and anti-GAD antibodies to help determine the type of diabetes and assess pancreatic function. Blood and urine cultures have also been sent to evaluate for infection. A repeat chest X-ray has been requested to check for any new developments.

The patient is receiving volume resuscitation and is on a diabetic diet. Her blood sugar levels are well controlled with the insulin infusion. She has two peripheral IV lines in place and is on prophylactic measures such as boots for deep vein throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with no significant personal medical history but with a strong family history of diabetes. She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and had blood glucose levels over 600 on admission. No obvious precipitant was identified, suggesting that the DKA has been ongoing for several weeks. The patient's condition is consistent with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), but given her family history, it could also be type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). 

The patient is currently receiving insulin infusion therapy and her blood sugar levels are well-controlled. She is also receiving fluids and electrolyte supplementation. Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, high ketone levels, low potassium, and slightly low sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly elevated heart rate. Her respiratory support is not required as she has an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals mild abdominal distension and no other significant abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoglycemia: As the patient is being transitioned from insulin infusion to long-acting insulin, there is a risk of hypoglycemia.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) recurrence: If the underlying cause of the DKA is not addressed, the patient may experience another episode of DKA.
3. Infection: The patient's blood and urine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old woman admitted with a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She experienced recurrent anion gaps despite being on insulin gtt, leading to the continuation of the insulin infusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 121/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,687 mL and output of 2,550 mL since 12 AM. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.19, indicating persistent acidosis. Physical examination reveals mild diffuse abdominal pain and mild cough. The patient has not had any bowel movements for 5 days. Laboratory results show a glucose level of 168 mg/dL, HbA1c of 7.2%, and other electrolyte imbalances. Imaging and microbiology tests are pending. The assessment and plan include managing the patient's DKA, starting a solid diet, fluid resuscitation, repleting electrolytes, and following up with HbA1c, C-peptide, and anti-GAD antibody tests. The patient also has constipation and a cough, for which appropriate measures are planned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of DKA: Despite the patient being on insulin gtt, there was a recurrence of anion gap"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been receiving an insulin infusion to control her blood sugar levels. The patient is now experiencing mild diffuse abdominal pain and a mild cough. No bowel movements have been reported in the past five days. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 121/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,687 mL and a total output of 2,550 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving IV fluids, insulin, and other medications as needed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient is being treated for new onset DKA, with plans to transition from an insulin infusion to glargine and humalog. The patient will also start a solid diet today and continue with fluid resuscitation due to ongoing osmotic diuresis.
2. The patient has constipation, for which scheduled laxatives/stool softeners will be started.
3. The patient has a cough that is worse when lying flat. It is unclear if this is related to a recent upper respiratory infection (URI) or seasonal allergies. Antihistamines such as Zyrtec or Claritin may be considered for symptom relief.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's chief complaint is not clearly mentioned in the note. The HPI mentions that the patient opened up a gap after starting long-acting agents and was restarted on insulin gtt. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/59 mmHg to 149/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on insulin therapy and other ICU medications.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mention of tender left lower quadrant (LLQ) and absent right and left distal pulses (DP). The physical examination reveals a warm skin temperature, attentive neurologic status, clear respiratory sounds, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and tenderness in the LLQ. The patient has a history of seasonal allergies, and there is a possibility of infection, which needs to be ruled out.

The laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), platelet (Plt) count, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphorus (PO4). However, the blood glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 72 to 269 mg/dL. The anion gap is negative. Other lab values include normal lactic acid levels, TCO2, and electrolytes.

The assessment and plan include the patient's new-onset DKA, strong family history of diabetes mellitus (DM), and recurrence of anion gap. The plan is to continue insulin gtt, transition to glargine + humalog, advance diet, and follow up with serial labs to replete phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. The patient also requires evaluation for constipation, cough, and potential infection. 

Overall, the patient's current condition is stable, with ongoing management of DKA and other medical issues. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening DKA, infection, constipation, and cardiovascular problems due to electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of diabetes and a strong family history of diabetes. She presented with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has been receiving insulin via a continuous infusion. Her fluid balance shows a total intake of 8,259 mL and a total output of 6,800 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,459 mL. The patient's lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, her blood glucose level is elevated at 269 mg/dL, and her serum potassium level is low at 3.6 mEq/L. Her anion gap is closed. The patient's physical examination reveals erythema on the post-pharynx and tenderness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. She is alert and oriented, with normal neurologic findings. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoglycemia: Since the patient is receiving insulin, there is a risk of low blood sugar levels if the insulin dosage is not properly adjusted.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's low serum potassium level needs to be monitored closely, as it can lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with no clear precipitating factor for new onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). They were already receiving insulin via a gtt and will continue to do so until their blood sugar levels return to normal. The plan is to transition the patient to glargine and humalog insulin along with a sliding scale, once their blood sugar stabilizes. The patient will also start a solid diet today and continue fluid resuscitation due to ongoing osmotic diuresis despite receiving IV fluids. Serial labs will be followed to replete electrolytes and phosphorus levels.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing constipation and will be started on scheduled laxatives/stool softeners. They have a persistent cough that worsens when lying flat, which could be related to a recent upper respiratory infection (URI) or seasonal allergies. An antihistamine such as [Doctor First Name], Zyrtec, or Claritin may be initiated, and over-the-counter cough suppression can be used if needed.

The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing care, including glycemic control, nutrition, and monitoring of lines. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, as well as stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

","The patient is a 21-year-old female with a new onset of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a strong family history of diabetes. She presented with no clear precipitating factor, but possibly a new diagnosis or upper respiratory infection (URI) given her cough. The patient experienced a recurrence of anion gap during the attempt to transition to long-acting insulin, so she was restarted on insulin gtt. The plan is to transition gtt to glargine + humalog and sliding scale, and then turn off the drip this morning. 

Other issues include constipation, for which scheduled laxatives/stool softeners are recommended, and cough, which is suspected to be due to seasonal allergies rather than an infection. Throat swab and sputum culture will be obtained to rule out infection. Inhaled nasal steroids may be started if sputum is negative. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Her temperature is within normal range. 

The patient's lab results show a glucose level of 269 mg/dL, HbA1c of 11.9%, WBC count of 6.7 K/uL, platelet count of 224 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 7 mg/dL. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of DKA, hypoglycemia after insulin therapy, electrolyte imbalances, infection due to immunocompromised state, and possible development of long-term complications of diabetes."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with no significant personal medical history but with a strong family history of diabetes. She presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which has been ongoing for several weeks without an obvious precipitant. Her blood sugar levels are elevated (>600 mg/dL), and she exhibits an anion gap metabolic acidosis. She is currently admitted to the ICU for management of DKA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient is already experiencing DKA, which can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances if not properly managed.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has shown signs of pre-renal azotemia, which has now resolved with intravenous fluid resuscitation. However, there is still a risk of acute renal failure due to prolonged hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
3. Infection: The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending, and she may be at risk of developing infections due to her compromised immune system.
4. Hypoglycemia: Once insulin therapy is initiated and glucose levels start to decrease, the patient may become at risk for hypoglycemia, which requires careful monitoring and adjustment of insulin doses.
5. Catabolism: Prolonged periods of insulin deficiency during DKA can lead to significant muscle breakdown and catabolism, resulting in loss of muscle mass"

","The patient is a 21-year-old female with no significant past medical history but with a strong family history of diabetes presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has a blood sugar level >600 mg/dL on admission, and her anion gap is 29. No obvious precipitant aside from a possible upper respiratory infection (URI) has been identified. The patient is likely to have type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) due to her young age and presentation with DKA. However, given her family history, it could also be type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.5Â°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is in sinus rhythm and has good air movement bilaterally.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 72 to 269 mg/dL, elevated hemoglobin A1c of 11.9%, and slightly elevated white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL. Other labs are within normal limits.

Imaging shows clear lungs without any intrathoracic process, and microbiology results are pending.

The patient is currently on insulin infusion and insulin plans as mentioned above. She is also on a diabetic diet and being ambulated for deep vein throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with no significant past medical history but a strong family history of diabetes. She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and had high blood sugar levels (>600 mg/dL) on admission. There was no obvious precipitant identified, suggesting that the condition has been ongoing for several weeks. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently receiving insulin via a continuous infusion. Fluid resuscitation has been initiated, and her renal function has improved from pre-renal azotemia. Further tests, including HgA1c, C-peptide, anti-GAD antibody levels, and cultures, have been ordered to evaluate her diabetes type and rule out infection. A repeat chest X-ray will also be obtained in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's initial presentation with DKA poses a significant risk for complications such as cerebral edema, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Close monitoring of electrolytes, acid-base balance, and blood glucose levels is crucial.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels remain elevated, indicating ongoing hyperglycemia. This can lead to further complications like polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and increased susceptibility to infections.

3. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function has improved with intravenous fluids, there"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch tall male with a history of DKA. The patient was given glargine and humalog at breakfast, but blood sugars started to rise throughout the day to >200 at lunch and >400 after lunch despite increasing humalog. Insulin gtt was discontinued, and IVF was started. The patient has no known drug allergies. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus rhythm, and fluid balance has a total input of 8,259 mL with a total output of 6,800 mL. Respiratory support is not required. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, skin examination is not assessed, and neurologic examination is not assessed. Laboratory results include WBC count of 6.7 K/uL, Hct of 34.3%, Plt of 224 K/uL, Cr of 0.9 mg/dL, Glucose of 72 mg/dL, Lactic Acid of 0.8 mmol/L, Ca++ of 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++ of 1.9 mg/dL, and PO4 of 2.2 mg/dL. Imaging shows clear lungs without any abnormalities, and microbiology is pending. The patient is being treated for DKA in the ICU with insulin infusion, nutrition, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is being treated for DKA in the ICU. The potential medical complications that can arise from DKA include:
1. Hypoglycemia: Due to insulin therapy, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if insulin dosage is not properly adjusted.
2. Infection: DKA patients are at higher risk for infections due to compromised immune system function.
3. Hypotension: Fluid shifts during DKA can lead to hypotension, which may require aggressive fluid resuscitation.
4. Cerebral edema: Although rare, rapid correction of hyperglycemia in DKA can lead to cerebral edema, especially in children.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: Electrolyte imbalances associated with DKA can predispose patients to cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Renal failure: Severe dehydration and electrolyte disturbances during DKA can lead to acute kidney injury or renal failure.
7. Thromboembolism: Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with no significant past medical history but a strong family history of diabetes. She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and required aggressive fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy. Her blood glucose levels have been in the 300's despite increasing her glargine dose. The patient is currently on a regular insulin sliding scale and has had multiple fingersticks per hour. She is expected to transition off the insulin drip and discontinue dextrose IV fluids once her blood sugar is under control. Further investigations include a follow-up HbA1c, C-peptide, anti-GAD antibody, and anti-Islet cell antibody tests to determine the type of diabetes. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, likely due to pre-renal causes. Anemia may be related to IV fluid resuscitation, as there is no evidence of gross bleeding. The patient's abnormal prior pulmonary artery pressures should be followed up with an outpatient appointment. She is receiving diabetic dietary support and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor once stabilized. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient initially presented with DKA, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. Close monitoring of blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of diabetes, presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 111/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is currently receiving insulin therapy and IV fluids. Her laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, as well as elevated hemoglobin A1c, suggesting poor glycemic control. She also has anemia with a hematocrit of 33.2%. The patient's kidney function is normal, and she has negative urine and blood cultures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body starts breaking down fat instead of glucose for energy, leading to the production of ketones. The patient's high blood glucose levels and acidotic state indicate the presence of DKA. Close monitoring and management with insulin therapy are necessary to correct the ketoacidosis and stabilize her blood sugar levels.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's initial presentation of acute renal failure has resolved, likely due to pre-renal causes related to dehydration. However, ongoing monitoring of kidney function is important to ensure there are no further complications.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit suggests"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with no significant past medical history but with a strong family history of diabetes. She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), likely type 1 diabetes given her age and presentation, although it could also be type 2 diabetes considering her family history. Her blood glucose level was initially over 600 mg/dL and there was no obvious precipitant aside from a possible urinary tract infection (URI). The patient has been resuscitated with fluids and insulin, and her gap has now closed. She has been transitioned off insulin gtt and is now on long-acting glargine at 40 units daily, as well as short-acting humalog with meals. She will continue to follow fingersticks every hour, and further tests including HgA1c, C-peptide, anti-GAD ab, and anti-Islet cell ab will be done. Cultures are also pending, and a throat swab for strep and sputum if available will be taken.

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. DKA can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure, which was likely pre-renal at admission. This could have been due"

","The patient is a 21-year-old female with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a strong family history of diabetes. The DKA appears to have occurred without a clear precipitating factor, possibly due to a new diagnosis or concurrent upper respiratory infection (URI). Despite initial improvement, there was a recurrence of anion gap, so insulin gtt was continued.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of cough, which is being evaluated for possible infection.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, with clear breath sounds and warm skin. Neurologic examination is incomplete, as movement, tone, and cranial nerve assessments were not performed. Lab results show elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low sodium, and normal potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. There are also elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with decreasing creatinine levels over time.

The plan moving forward includes transitioning the patient from insulin gtt to long-acting glargine and short-acting humalog, along with a sliding scale, and discontinuing the insulin drip. Fluid resuscitation will continue with D5NS at 100 cc/hr, and electrolyte imbalances will be monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a new onset of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a strong family history of diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU for management and stabilization. Her blood sugars have been better controlled over the past 24 hours, and she is currently on long-acting insulin agents (glargine and humalog) with a sliding scale. Her diet has been advanced, and she will need to increase her long-acting insulin to enhance control. Additional tests include HgA1c, C-peptide, and anti-GAD antibody levels. The patient also has a cough, which is being evaluated for possible infection or seasonal allergies. She is on prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels were initially elevated at 600 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia. This can lead to further complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. DKA can lead to organ dysfunction and requires prompt medical intervention.
3. Hypoglyc"
