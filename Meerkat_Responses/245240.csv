   1.  Hypotension:  Remains off levophed,  lactate remains normal.  Given
   high fever and now GNRs in bcxs from admission, concern for septic
   shock.  Possible sources include UTI (positive U/A), UCx pending.  Less
   likely to be pneumonia given no clear infiltrate on CXR yesterday and
   today.  Less likely to be meningitis given lack of HA, neck stiffness,
   photophobia.  Currently appears euvolemic after fluid resuscitation by
   ED; good UOP overnight.  Does not appear to be cardiogenic but will
   repeat ECHO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of mental retardation and bipolar disorder. She presents with altered mental status, fever, and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with multi-lumen and started on vancomycin and Zosyn for UTI and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 111/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP mask. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated glucose level, and abnormal kidney function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels suggest a possible infection leading to septic shock. Sources of infection include UTI, UCx pending, and pneumonia. Further evaluation and management are required, including repeat echo, IVF boluses as needed, and monitoring of urine and blood cultures.
2. Acute mental status changes: The patient's alertness and orientation may vary, and it is unclear if these changes are related to her underlying medical conditions or other factors. Continued monitoring, including holding certain medications, assessing mental status with family input, and considering re-gas and bipap if necessary, is recommended.
3. Tachypnea: The patient's wheezing and known restrictive lung disease may contribute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and bipolar disorder. She presented with altered mental status, fever, and hypotension. The patient remains off levophed, and her lactate levels are normal. There is concern for septic shock, possible sources including a urinary tract infection (positive urine analysis) and pending upper respiratory cultures. The patient appears euvolemic after fluid resuscitation in the emergency department with good urine output overnight. She does not appear to have cardiogenic shock but will have a repeat echocardiogram. 

The patient's acute mental status changes are unclear due to her pre-existing mental retardation and bipolar disorder. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, and able to relay medications. There were no recent changes to her medications. An arterial blood gas from the emergency department did not show hypercapnia, although she has a significant history of this condition. 

The patient has tachypnea and is extremely wheezy, known to have restrictive lung disease. Brain natriuretic peptide levels are only 500, making it less likely to be cardiogenic wheeze. Nebulizers are given every four hours standing and as needed, Advair is continued, and steroids are avoided due to a history of steroid-induced psychosis. CPAP for obstructive sleep apnea at home settings of 19 cm/H2O is also considered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of manic depression and bipolar disorder. She presents with altered mental status, fever, and hypotension. The patient's condition has been improving with the administration of antibiotics and other medications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, including fever and hypotension. Although her hypotension has resolved, she still has a high fever, and there are gram-negative rods in her blood culture. This suggests the possibility of ongoing sepsis.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient reports feeling much better but continues to experience wheezing. She has known restrictive lung disease and requires CPAP support for OSA. There is a concern about the possibility of cardiogenic wheezing due to her mild aortic valve stenosis, but her BNP level is low, making this less likely. Nebulizers, Advair, and avoidance of steroids are recommended to manage her respiratory symptoms.

3. Mental status changes: The patient initially had acute mental status changes, but her mental status is now back to baseline according to the family visiting. There is consideration for restarting seroquel, which was previously held due to confusion and delirium.

4. Fall risk: The patient had a fall, and it is difficult to obtain a complete history. Differential diagnosis includes cardiac arrhythmia, worsening aortic"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of bipolar disorder and restrictive lung disease. She presented with altered mental status, fever, and hypotension. The patient's fever and hypotension have resolved, and she is off levophed. Blood cultures from admission grew gram-negative rods, and a urine culture was positive for E. coli. Legionella urinary antigen was negative. 

The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected sepsis of urinary origin. Surveillance blood cultures are planned today. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is alert. She may benefit from restarting seroquel. 

The patient's tachypnea is likely due to her restrictive lung disease. She is being given nebulizers q4 standing, q2 prn, and continuing Advair. CPAP is also being provided for OSA. 

The patient's sinus tachycardia has improved but still persists, likely due to ongoing fevers. 

The patient fell, but it is difficult to obtain a history. Differential diagnosis includes cardiac causes, arrhythmia, worsening of aortic stenosis, and medication effects. Telemetry has not revealed any arrhythmia, and cardiac enzymes were negative. An echocardiogram showed no acute change from prior, only revealing mild aortic stenosis. 

The patient's baseline creatinine of 0.9 is now at 1."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  66 yo F with MR, bipolar disorder who presents with altered
   mental status, fever, and hypotension.
   .
   1.  Hypotension:  Remains off levophed,  lactate remains normal.  Given
   high fever and now GNRs in bcxs from admission, concern for septic
   shock.  Possible sources include UTI (positive U/A), UCx pending.  Less
   likely to be pneumonia given no clear infiltrate on CXR yesterday and
   today.  Less likely to be meningitis given lack of HA, neck stiffness,
   photophobia.  Currently appears euvolemic after fluid resuscitation by
   ED; good UOP overnight.  Does not appear to be cardiogenic but will
   repeat ECHO.
   - f/u urine cultures, blood cultures
   - sputum culture if can produce
   - check legionella
   - IVF boluses prn with caution given dCHF
   - hold lasix for now
   - vanc and zosyn for UTI, ?[**Last Name (LF) 8664**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] tailor abx to culture data
   .
   2.  Acute mental status changes:  Unclear baseline given MR, bipolar.
   Pt alert and oriented x3 and to president.  Able to relay medications.
   No recent changes to medications.  ABG in ED did not show hypercapnia
   though with sig. history for this.
   - cont. cogentin, haldol per patient insistence
   - hold seroquel, topmax for now
   - will need family to assess mental status
   - if mental status changes worsen, will re-gas and try bipap
   .
   3.  Tachypnea:  Patient extremely wheezy.  Known restrictive lung
   disease.  BNP only 500, less likely to be cardiogenic wheeze.
   - nebulizers q4 standing, q2 prn
   - cont. Advair
   - avoid steroids given h/o steroid-induced psychosis
   - CPAP for OSA, home settings of (CPAP 19cm/4L)
   - consider CTA if no improvement, hold off while in ARF
   .
   4.  Sinus Tachycardia:  Improved after IVFs.
   - IVFs prn
   - consider CTA if no improvement, hold off while in ARF
   # Fall:
   Difficult to obtain history.  DDx inc. cardiac, arrhythmia, worsening
   of AS, med effect.
   - monitor on tele
   - rule out CEs, ASA
   - repeat ECHO
   - hold seroquel, topamax
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr of 0.9, is at 1.2 this AM. Furosemide had been held.
   - Follow-up urine lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of mental retardation (MR), bipolar disorder, and a previous diagnosis of hypertension. She presents with altered mental status, fever, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 122/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving CPAP support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient remains off levophed, and lactate levels are normal. There is concern for septic shock due to the high fever and presence of gram-negative rods in blood cultures from admission. Possible sources include urinary tract infection (UTI) and central venous catheter infection, with less likely possibilities of pneumonia or meningitis. The patient appears euvolemic after fluid resuscitation, with good urine output overnight. It is planned to repeat an echocardiogram and continue with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum culture will be followed up. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam will be tailored based on culture data.

2. Acute mental status changes: The patient's baseline mental status is unclear given her MR and bipolar disorder. She is alert and oriented to time,"

   Respiratory Distress: Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known
   obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and
   restrictive lung disease as well as diastolic heart failure.  CXR now
   with worsening interstial edema and ABG with new hypercarbia.  Is being
   transferred back to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation with BIPAP.
   Differential diagnosis includes respiratory infection, aspiration
   pneumonitis or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema from systemic
   inflammation. She was transferred back to ICU for BIPAP
   - continue standing albuterol Q4H and Q2H:PRN
   - continue standing ipratropium
   - bipap with increase settings to 15/8

   if decompensates
   - continue aggressive diuresis with I/O goal 1 to 2 liters negative
   daily
   - follow CXR
   .
   Urosepsis:  Grew e. coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin from both the blood
   and the urine.  Has been hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - continue ciprofloxacin

   Altered Mental Status:  Resolved.  Likely altered in the setting of
   infection.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including cogentin and haldol
   - continue to hold seroquel
   - monitor closely for worsening in the setting of worsening hypercarbia
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now down to 1.2 (baseline 0.9).
   - monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   Hypertension:  Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   .
   Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:  Currently appears volume
   overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal 1-2 liters negative
   .
   Bipolar disorder: Stable.
   - cont. lithium, haldol, congentin
   - hold seroquel for now given recent mental status changes

- The differential diagnosis includes respiratory infection, aspiration pneumonitis, or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema from systemic inflammation.
- The patient has shown improvement in her condition, with resolving altered mental status and stable vital signs.
- However, she still has worsening respiratory distress and is experiencing hypercarbia.
- The plan is to continue non-invasive ventilation with increased settings, along with other ongoing treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
- The patient has known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and restrictive lung disease, which can contribute to respiratory distress.
- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema from systemic inflammation is also a possibility.
- These conditions increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, and further exacerbations of asthma.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
- The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload and worsening"

The patient had urosepsis caused by e. coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin from both the blood and urine. She has been hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours, so ciprofloxacin will be continued.

The patient's altered mental status has resolved, likely altered"

","Summary:
The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been placed on non-invasive ventilation. They were transferred back to the ICU after spending time on the floor, and were on CPAP overnight. The patient has allergies to penicillins, ativan, metformin, and prednisone. Antibiotics administered include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. The patient is also receiving infusions of heparin sodium and furosemide. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged except for the noted above. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/67 to 134/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,311 mL and output of 2,505 mL, with a negative balance of 1,195 mL. The patient is on BiPAP ventilation support with a tidal volume of 306 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 17 cmH2O, and a PaO2 of 68 mmHg. Physical examination reveals wheezing and increased respiratory rate. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal imaging with worsening bilateral infiltrates. The assessment and plan include respiratory distress possibly due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome or flash pulmonary edema, urinary tract infection, and bacteremia. The patient is receiving appropriate care including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and mechanical ventilation support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, further deterioration of lung function, and potential sepsis due to the presence of bacteremia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been placed on non-invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, ativan, metformin, prednisone, and confusion/delirium. The patient has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.7°F) with a current temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F), heart rate of 93 bpm with a range of 80-102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/67 mmHg to 134/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute with a range of 23-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.

The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and they are receiving fluid intake of 1,311 mL and 230 mL, with output of 711 mL and 230 mL. The total fluid balance is -1,195 mL. The patient is on bipap ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 306 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 17 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) reading of 7.22/68/96.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and alert, experiencing moderate respiratory distress, with wheezes in the lungs and regular respirations. The abdomen is described as benign without edema.

Lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.5, hemoglobin (Hct) of 35.3, platelet count (Plt) of 146, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3, troponin-T level of 0.03, blood glucose level of 163, and other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, differential, lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate.

Imaging reveals worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are likely flash edema due to diastolic congestive heart failure rather than acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis. The patient's obesity and hypoventilation (Pickwickian syndrome) will be managed with bipap. Urinary tract infection (UTI) and bacteremia while on ciprofloxacin are also noted.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and is now back in the ICU for worsening respiratory distress. The patient has a history of steroid psychosis and has been experiencing intermittent use of BiPAP. She also has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient's altered mental status has resolved, and her acute renal failure is improving. She is also being treated for hypertension, diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis, and bipolar disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and diastolic heart failure. The worsening interstitial edema seen on CXR and new hypercarbia on ABG indicate potential complications related to her respiratory status.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. However, there is a risk of worsening or development of antibiotic-resistant strains due to the use of multiple antibiotics.
3. Diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic heart failure may lead to fluid overload, resulting in worsening respiratory distress and potential complications such as pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and now transferred back to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical conditions including obesity hypoventilation syndrome, restrictive lung disease, and diastolic heart failure. She has shown improvement in sepsis of urinary origin, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and hypertension. However, her diastolic CHF and bipolar disorder require ongoing management. The patient is currently being treated with non-invasive ventilation using BiPAP, standing albuterol, ipratropium, ciprofloxacin for UTI, and lasix for diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely multifactorial due to her known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, restrictive lung disease, and diastolic heart failure. Worsening interstitial edema and hypercarbia on ABG indicate the need for close monitoring and possible intervention with BiPAP or mechanical ventilation if necessary.

2. Infection: Although the patient has shown improvement in sepsis of urinary origin, there is still a risk of further infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay. Monitoring for signs of infection and prompt antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, hypoxemia, and suspected respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving BiPAP support, but it has not been well-tolerated. His BNP level is elevated at 2126, indicating possible heart failure. He has been given multiple doses of lasix to manage his fluid balance. The patient's allergies include penicillins, ativan, metformin, and prednisone. His last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by hypoxemia and an ABG showing a pH of 7.32. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Heart failure: The elevated BNP level suggests the possibility of heart failure, which could be contributing to the patient's altered mental status and respiratory difficulties.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of urinary tract infection, which may require appropriate antibiotic treatment.
4. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as ""altered,"" it is important to differentiate between delirium and other forms of confusion. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset and fluctuating"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a middle-aged female with obesity, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and suspected sepsis.
- She has a history of allergies to penicillins and has been experiencing confusion, nausea, and vomiting.
- The patient received antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Ciprofloxacin) and other medications including Heparin Sodium.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82-132/40-69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation.
- The patient has been receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation and supplemental oxygen.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased troponin T levels.
- The patient has new infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may be due to flash edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis.
- Assessment and plan include increasing BIPAP, continuing diuresis, broadening antibiotics if clinical worsening occurs, and managing obesity-related hypoventilation (Pickwickian syndrome).
- Other issues include urinary tract infection (UTI) and bacteremia while on ciprofloxacin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a morbidly obese individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing respiratory distress, possibly related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), as well as worsening lung infiltrates that are concerning for pneumonia. The patient has been on BIPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) and diuresis to manage these symptoms. Antibiotics have been initiated, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), but ciprofloxacin has been replaced with Zosyn due to suspected bacteremia. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus with surgical site infection (SSI). Other medical conditions include urinary tract infection (UTI) and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The worsening lung infiltrates and respiratory distress indicate a potential pneumonia, which may require further intervention such as additional antibiotics or other respiratory support measures.
2. UTI/Bacteremia: The patient has a history of UTI and bacteremia, which could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. DVT: As the patient is immobile in the ICU, there is an increased risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has a history of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to worsening symptoms of respiratory distress, including difficulty breathing and hypoxia. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation but was later transitioned to bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 132/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient also has elevated lactate levels and abnormal arterial blood gas values. Imaging studies reveal worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with worsening infiltrates. The plan includes continuing BIPAP support, diuresis, broadening antibiotics to include vancomycin and Zosyn, and administering bronchodilators. The patient's obesity and hypoventilation syndrome are being managed with BIPAP. Additionally,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected urinary tract infection, fever of unknown origin, and hypoxemia. The patient has been on BiPAP support since 03/30/2149. His VBG values have been fluctuating, indicating potential respiratory issues. The patient's PICC line was placed on 03/30/2149 and repositioned due to poor blood return. He received quetiapine for agitation. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, hypertension, and elevated heart rate. His fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,341 mL and output of 1,700 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated leukocyte count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney function. The assessment includes obesity hypoventilation syndrome, altered mental status, urinary tract infection, history of falls, and fever of unknown origin. The plan includes continued ICU care, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's fluctuating VBG values and hypoxemia may indicate a risk of respiratory failure, especially considering his obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
2. Infection: The suspected urinary tract infection and fever of unknown origin suggest a potential risk of infection, which can complicate the patient's"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and is now back in the ICU for worsening respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory distress is most likely multifactorial, considering her known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, as well as diastolic heart failure. The chest X-ray shows worsening interstitial edema, and the ABG indicates new hypercarbia on 3/28 prior to transfer back to MICU. The patient has intermittently been on BiPAP, and wheezes diffusely. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and hypercarbia suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Immediate intervention may be required to prevent further deterioration.

2. Infection: The presence of e. coli in both blood and urine indicates a urinary tract infection that has potentially spread to the bloodstream. This could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not properly managed.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with mental retardation, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a history of urosepsis and is currently being treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains critically ill. She is on non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP and has diminished breath sounds in her chest. She is also experiencing confusion and delirium. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and blood glucose levels. The patient has a history of asthma, bipolar disorder, hypertension, and is on multiple medications including antipsychotics and antihypertensives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, along with her obesity hypoventilation syndrome, increase the risk of respiratory failure. Her current condition suggests that she is not adequately ventilating, leading to her respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a bacterial infection of the lungs. If not properly treated, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be associated with diastolic heart failure, which can further compromise her cardiac function and overall respiratory status.
4. Deep vein thrombosis"

s sister.  Explained to her
   that Ms. [**Known lastname 8692**]
s condition has deteriorated with worsening
   hypercapnic respiratory failure despite bipap and antibiotics.  She is
   in danger of requiring intubation and given her poor mental status, it
   would be worthwhile trying steroids to see if intubation can be
   avoided.  Given that she has a life threatening condition, we feel that
   the risk of steroids and potential psychomotor side effects of these
   steroids are outweighed by the potential benefits to avoid intubation.
   She said that she understood and agreed with treatment plan.
   Review of medical records shows that patient had been treated with
   steroids in [**2146**] and [**2145**] without evident side effects in medical
   records.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with mental retardation, obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and on home bipap. She was originally admitted with urosepsis and returned to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has several medical conditions, including asthma, bipolar disorder, hypertension, and a recent episode of E. coli septicemia from a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 104/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on bipap. Her blood glucose level is elevated at 220 mg/dL.

Physical examination findings reveal that the patient is overweight/obese, distressed, with diminished breath sounds in the chest. She is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and murmurs incoherently. Her peripheral pulses, heart sounds, and bowel sounds are within normal limits. Neurological examination is incomplete due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 209 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 32 mEq/L, low hemoglobin (Hct) level of 32.3%, and elevated platelet count (Plt"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s overnight
   and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].
   - cont to adjust vent settings for new intubation
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5
   - as patient was visibly tiring with increasing pCO2, would like to
   cont steroids. The patient does have history of steroid psychosis,
   however at this point, her respiratory status is a more important
   issue.
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection)
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including cogentin, haldol, and
   seroqeul
   - monitor closely for worsening in the setting of worsening respiratory
   status
   - will try to use smaller dosing of seroquel to avoid oversedation
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Creatinine now down to 0.9 (baseline 0.9).
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Cont. lithium, haldol, congentin, seroquel

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and is now back in the ICU for worsening respiratory distress, requiring intubation on 3/31. 

The patient's respiratory distress is likely multifactorial, involving known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, as well as diastolic heart failure. She has been on BiPAP intermittently and has worsening ABG overnight, leading to intubation on 4/1. Vent settings are being adjusted for the new intubation, and she will continue to receive albuterol and ipratropium. Vancomycin and Zosyn are being continued for empiric pneumonia coverage, along with Lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5.

The patient has a history of sepsis of urinary origin, which has been treated with Zosyn. She has been hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection and will be closely monitored, particularly in the setting of worsening respiratory status. Home psychiatric medications including cogentin, haldol, and seroquel will be continued, with smaller dosing of seroquel to avoid oversedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old obese female with a chief complaint of somnolence. She has been experiencing desats and hypercarbia, along with wheezing. The patient has been aggressive and combative, leading to the addition of Haldol to her medication regimen. She was intubated due to worsening ABG results. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, Ativan, metformin, prednisone, and confusion/delirium. She has been receiving various medications including propofol, furosemide, heparin sodium, and haloperidol. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her current temperature is 36.9°C, and her maximum temperature was 37.1°C. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's flow sheet data shows positive fluid balance and respiratory support with a ventilator. Physical examination reveals an intubated and sedated patient with mild expiratory wheezes. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count and elevated lactate levels. The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, altered mental status, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, urinary tract infection, history of falls, fever of unknown origin, and wheezing. The patient is under full code status and her disposition is pending further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and obesity are risk factors for DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists may be necessary.
4. Hypoglycemia: Insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are common in critically ill patients. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate insulin therapy should be administered.
5. Autonomic dysreflexia: This is a potential complication in patients with spinal cord injury, characterized by sudden onset of hypertension and bradycardia. Monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is crucial."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s overnight
   and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].
   - cont to adjust vent settings for new intubation
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5 L
   - as patient was visibly tiring with increasing pCO2, would like to
   cont steroids. The patient does have history of steroid psychosis,
   however at this point, her respiratory status is a more important
   issue.
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection)
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - currently NPO after intubation, however, plan to ultimately continue
   home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin, haldol, and
   will hold seroqeul. will try to use smaller dosing of seroquel if later
   needed after extubation to avoid oversedation
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Creatinine now down to 0.9 (baseline 0.9).
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and transferred back to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of mental illness, including bipolar disorder, and is currently non-responsive due to intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a known history of obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and diastolic heart failure. Her respiratory distress is likely multifactorial. The worsening interstitial edema seen on chest X-ray and the new hypercarbia on ABG indicate a need for close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings. 

2. Sepsis of Urinary Origin: The patient has grown E. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and urine. She has been hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours. It is important to continue coverage for presumed pulmonary infection with Zosyn.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely altered due to infection. She is currently NPO after intubation, but it is planned to continue home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin, haldol, and hold seroquel. Smaller dosing of seroquel may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s over that
   night and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].
   - cont to adjust vent settings for new intubation, patient with likely
   high pCO2 at baseline so will adjust for pCO2 in the 50
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1 L
   - as patient was extremely wheezy prior to intubation, would like to
   cont steroids. The patient does have history of steroid psychosis,
   however at this point, her respiratory status is a more important
   issue. Can taper to 60mg prednisone today given improved clinical lung
   exam
   - will decrease propofol and attempt to convert to PSV today
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection)
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin,
   haldol, and will hold seroquel. will try to use smaller dosing of
   seroquel if later needed after extubation to avoid oversedation
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Creatinine stable, though slightly up today (baseline 0.9).
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1L today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel if needed)

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and later transferred back to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and intubated on [3-31].

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Respiratory Distress: The patient has known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, as well as diastolic heart failure. Her chest X-ray shows worsening interstitial edema, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals new hypercarbia on [3-28] prior to transfer. She was intermittently using BiPAP and continued to wheeze diffusely. Steroids were started on [3-31], but she continued to have worsening ABGs overnight and eventually required intubation due to hypercarbia on [4-1]. Adjustments to the ventilator settings are being made to address the high pCO2 levels. Albuterol and ipratropium will continue to be administered, along with steroids. Lasix will be given with an I/O goal of -0.5 to -1 L.

- Sepsis of urinary origin: The patient grew E. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and urine. She has been hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours. Zos"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes obesity, altered mental status, and a history of falls. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 134/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and lorazepam.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper respiratory hygiene and frequent evaluation of sputum cultures will be necessary to prevent this.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and surveillance for symptoms such as calf pain or swelling should be performed.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's sedation and critical illness may increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers should be considered for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBS"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s overnight
   and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].
   - cont to adjust vent settings for new intubation
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5 L
   - as patient was visibly tiring with increasing pCO2, would like to
   cont steroids. The patient does have history of steroid psychosis,
   however at this point, her respiratory status is a more important
   issue.
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection)
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - currently NPO after intubation, however, plan to ultimately continue
   home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin, haldol, and
   will hold seroqeul. will try to use smaller dosing of seroquel if later
   needed after extubation to avoid oversedation
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Creatinine now down to 0.9 (baseline 0.9).
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel)

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and later transferred back to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of steroid psychosis, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and worsening interstitial edema on chest X-ray. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes. She also has elevated levels of potassium, magnesium, and phosphate. The patient's respiratory status is a priority, and she is being treated with albuterol, ipratropium, steroids, Vancomycin, and Zosyn. Her fluid balance is being closely monitored, and she is receiving diuretics to manage diastolic CHF. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection, and her renal function is stable. Her blood pressure is under control, and her bipolar disorder is being managed with home psychiatric medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and diastolic heart failure. The worsening interstitial edema on chest X-ray and hypercarbia indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure."

   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s over that
   night and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].
   - wean vent to extubated today
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1 L
   - cont steroids today
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection)
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin,
   haldol, and will hold seroquel. will try to use smaller dosing of
   seroquel if later needed after extubation to avoid oversedation
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Creatinine stable, though slightly up today (baseline 0.9).
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1L today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel if needed)

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and transferred back to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbia. The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, asthma, and diastolic heart failure. She also has a mild aortic valve stenosis and mild chronic kidney disease. The patient's current conditions include respiratory distress, sepsis of urinary origin, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypertension, and bipolar disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening ABG indicate the possibility of further respiratory complications. She may experience increased carbon dioxide levels, decreased oxygen saturation, or even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient still has a risk of developing further infections, especially since she has sepsis of urinary origin. This could lead to secondary infections such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's stable creatinine levels indicate that her acute renal failure is currently managed. However, there is still a risk of worsening renal function due to factors like decreased urine output or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s over that
   night and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].
   - well on [**11-25**] overnight PS.  cont to adjust vent settings for new
   intubation, patient with likely high pCO2 at baseline so will adjust
   for pCO2 in the 50
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1 L
   - as patient was extremely wheezy prior to intubation, would like to
   cont steroids. The patient does have history of steroid psychosis,
   however at this point, her respiratory status is a more important
   issue. Can taper to 60mg prednisone today given improved clinical lung
   exam
   - cont propofol sedation
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection)
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin,
   haldol, and will hold seroquel. will try to use smaller dosing of
   seroquel if later needed after extubation to avoid oversedation
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Creatinine stable, though slightly up today (baseline 0.9).
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1L today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel if needed)

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with urosepsis and transferred back to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress, leading to intubation on [3-31].

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are as follows:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, as well as diastolic heart failure. The worsening interstitial edema seen on the chest X-ray and new hypercarbia on [3-28] indicate a need for close monitoring and management of respiratory status.

2. Sepsis of urinary origin: The patient had a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, which has led to sepsis. Although she has been hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours, continued antibiotic coverage is necessary.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection. Proper management of infection and supportive care will be required.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have slightly increased, indicating possible acute renal failure. Monitoring kidney function and avoiding nephrotoxins are important.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures are stable, but diuresis and fluid management should continue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of allergies to penicillins and lorazepam, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes confusion/delirium with metformin and prednisone. The patient was changed to pressure support ventilation (PSV) 12 over 8 overnight with an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of 7.40/60/112. Propofol was decreased to 45 mcg/kg/min for sedation liberation. The patient has allergies to Ativan (lorazepam), prednisone, and metformin.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients, such as those in the ICU, are at increased risk for stress ulcers, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,313 mL and output of 2,450 mL, indicating a negative balance of -137 mL. This could suggest fluid overload or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He presented to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath and was intubated due to respiratory failure. Since admission, he has been on mechanical ventilation and sedation with propofol.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 106/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. His weight has decreased from 118.2 kg to 109.6 kg during his stay.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,313 mL (693 mL PO, 1,948 mL IVF) and an output of 2,450 mL (1,260 mL urine, 200 mL NG, 100 mL stool). His drain balance is negative 137 mL.

On the respiratory support, the patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL and a pressure level (PS) of 14 cmH2O. The patient's spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) is 30 breaths per minute. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH 7.40, PaCO2 60 mmHg,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities including MR (medical research), OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), obesity hypoventilation, respiratory failure, and several other conditions. She was switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday and did well. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/58 mmHg to 149/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. Her heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. The patient's weight has decreased from 118.2 kg at admission to 109.6 kg currently. 

The patient is receiving several medications including propofol, heparin sodium, furosemide, and various other drugs for her medical conditions. She has allergies to penicillins, Ativan, metformin, prednisone, and confusion/delirium. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. Her flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium, and elevated glucose levels. Other lab results are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s over that
   night and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].  Started
   on steroids upon intubation on [**4-1**] and continued on steroid course
   until [**4-3**] when she was successfully extubated with much improved
   respiratory mechanics.
   - cont monitor resp status
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1 L
   - cont steroids today
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection)
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin,
   haldol, and will hold seroquel.
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Creatinine stable, though slightly up today (baseline 0.9).
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1L today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel if needed)
   .
   FEN:  Clears, ADAT today as mental status permits.
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots/heparin sq, PPI, bowel regimen

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic congestive heart failure, and bipolar disorder. She was admitted initially with urosepsis and then transferred back to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress, leading to intubation on [3-31]. 

The patient's respiratory distress is likely multifactorial, considering her known obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, as well as diastolic heart failure. The chest X-ray showed worsening interstitial edema, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) indicated new hypercarbia on [3-28]. Intermittent use of BiPAP was not effective, and she continued to wheeze diffusely. Steroids were started on [3-31] and continued until [4-3], when she was successfully extubated with improved respiratory mechanics. 

The patient has also been diagnosed with sepsis of urinary origin, as evidenced by the growth of E. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and urine. She has been hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours. 

In addition to her respiratory and urinary conditions, the patient has altered mental status likely related to infection. Her home psychiatric medications, including lithium, cogentin, haldol, and seroquel, should be continued. 

The patient's acute renal failure is indicated by a stable creatinine level, although slightly up"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. He required invasive ventilation and was extubated without incident. However, he became agitated again during the afternoon but managed well with PRN Haldol and cranberry juice. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, Ativan (Lorazepam), metformin, prednisone, and confusion/ delirium. He is currently receiving various medications including furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and haloperidol (Haldol). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for wheezing. His vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and low oxygen saturation. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 449 mL. Respiratory support is being provided through a nasal cannula with PSV/SBT mode, set at a tidal volume of 227 mL, pressure support of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 215. Physical examination findings include awake and responsive general appearance, slightly dry oral mucosa, large neck circumference, no wheezes in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s over that
   night and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].  Started
   on steroids upon intubation on [**4-1**] and continued on steroid course
   until [**4-3**] when she was successfully extubated with much improved
   respiratory mechanics.  Patient still with difficulty tolerating BiPAP,
   although does use it at home.
   - cont monitor resp status
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage.  Plan 14d
   course.
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1 L
   - cont steroids today
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection).  Will d/c
   zosyn when coverage for PNA is complete.
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin,
   haldol, and will hold seroquel.
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at baseline level.  Today [**4-4**] with
   new hypernatremia.
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - PM lytes, monitor Na.  Will give free water if continues to climb.
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1L today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel if needed)

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypercapneic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, BiPAP, and nutritional support. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/68 to 163/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for improved pulmonary findings compared to yesterday. The patient is awake and responsive with no obvious distress. Physical examination reveals a large neck circumference, inability to see the level of JVP, no wheezes, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs, obesity with bowel sounds present, and trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal arterial blood gas values indicating respiratory acidosis with elevated CO2 levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, rash, confusion/delirium related to Ativan, metformin, nausea/vomiting, and prednisone. The patient has a history of falls and wheezing.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with developmental delay, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with sepsis of urinary origin, later developed respiratory
   failure and was intubated. Now s/p extubation on [**2149-4-4**].
   # Hypercapneic respiratory failure:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  Intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].  Started on
   steroids upon intubation on [**4-1**] and continued on steroid course until
   [**4-3**] when she was successfully extubated with much improved respiratory
   mechanics. Patient tolerated BiPAP well overnight. Encouraging ABG on
   BiPAP this AM.
   - Continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage.  Plan
   14 day course ending on [**2149-4-12**].
   - Return to home furosemide dosing
   - Continue steroids
   - Continue BiPAP at night
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection) until
   [**2149-4-12**] for pneumonia course. Treatment of UTI and bacteremia will be
   completed with that length of treatment.
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection. Appears to be back to
   baseline.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin,
   haldol, and will hold seroquel.
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Has been doing well with diuresis
   - Restart home furosemide dosing today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable. Patient denies hallucinations.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel if needed)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of developmental delay, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic congestive heart failure, and bipolar disorder. She was initially admitted with sepsis of urinary origin and later developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient has now been successfully extubated and is showing improvement in respiratory mechanics. She tolerated BiPAP well overnight, and her most recent ABG results are encouraging.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and diastolic heart failure, which could contribute to her hypercapneic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and continued use of BiPAP may be necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

2. Sepsis of Urinary Origin: The patient had an infection caused by e. coli, which was sensitive to both blood and urine cultures. She has been hemodynamically stable, and treatment for the urinary tract infection and bacteremia will be completed with a 14-day course of Zosyn.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been altered, likely due to infection. However, she appears to be back to baseline now, and her psychiatric medications should be continued.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures have been stable, indicating that her hypertension is currently well-man"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with mental retardation, asthma, obstructive sleep
   apnea on home CPAP, diastolic CHF, and bipolar disorder initially
   admitted with urosepsis now transferred back to the ICU for worsening
   respiratory distress and intubated on [**3-31**].
   # Respiratory Distress:
   Most likely multifactorial.  Patient with known obstructive sleep
   apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as diastolic
   heart failure.  CXR now with worsening interstitial edema and ABG with
   new hypercarbia on [**3-28**] prior to transfer back to MICU. Had
   intermittently been on BiPAP. Continued to wheeze diffusely, with
   steroids started on [**3-31**]. Continued to have worsening ABG
s over that
   night and was eventually intubated due to hypercarbia on [**4-1**].  Started
   on steroids upon intubation on [**4-1**] and continued on steroid course
   until [**4-3**] when she was successfully extubated with much improved
   respiratory mechanics.  Patient still with difficulty tolerating BiPAP,
   although does use it at home.
   - cont monitor resp status
   - continue standing albuterol and ipratropium
   - cont Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric pneumonia coverage.  Plan 14d
   course.
   - continue lasix with I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1 L
   - cont steroids today
   # Sepsis of urinary origin:
   Grew e. coli pan-sensitive from both the blood and the urine.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable for the past 48 hours.
   - cont Zosyn (indicated for presumed pulmonary infection).  Will d/c
   zosyn when coverage for PNA is complete.
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely altered in the setting of infection.
   - continue home psychiatric medications including lithium, cogentin,
   haldol, and will hold seroquel.
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at baseline level.  Today [**4-4**] with
   new hypernatremia.
   - Monitor creatinine with diuresis
   - PM lytes, monitor Na.  Will give free water if continues to climb.
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable.
   - continue lasix for diuresis
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:
   Currently appears volume overloaded in CXR.
   - I/O goal even to -0.5 to -1L today
   #Bipolar disorder:
   Stable.
   - Plan as above regarding home meds (lithium, haldol, congentin,
   seroquel if needed)
