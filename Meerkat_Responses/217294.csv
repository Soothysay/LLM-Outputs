   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening dyspnea
   over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to HCAP
   vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Differential diagnosis includes HCAP,
   aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema. Patient has
   history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and has failed outpatient
   regimen of levofloxacin now presenting with worsening hypoxemia and
   bibasilar infiltrates concerning for aspiration vs multifocal PNA.
   Subacute nature of symptoms with normal WBC and lack of bandemia make
   acute infection and sepsis less likely but hypotension concerning for
   evolving SIRS/sepsis in setting of abnormal CXR. CXR today shows volume
   overload with right pleural effusion making it difficult to assess
   interval change in RLL infiltrate. Likely has both infectious process
   at RLL and CHF contributing to respiratory status.
   - sputum cx growing gram positive rods, f/u speciation/sensis
   - Empiric antibiotics Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levoflox for now while cx
   data pending
   - TBB goal even today, diuresis with 40 IV Lasix as needed
   - PSV trial
   - Trend fever and WBC
   - follow up blood cx, sputum cx
   - albuterol and ipratropium MDI given wheezing, smoking history, and
   has been on them at [**Hospital3 240**]
   .
   #. Hypotension: Given time course of hypotension and rapid improvement
   with fluids, likely mostly related to sedation. Lactate improved from
   3.1 to 1.2. Cardiogenic shock less likely given improvement.
   - continue IVFs to maintain MAP>65 and UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - f/u TTE read
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE [**10-13**] with EF 10% although not clinically volume
   overloaded and no evidence of worsening pulmonary edema on CXR.
   Unlikely to be in cardiogenic shock since was able to wean off pressors
   overnight.
   - redose coumadinin 2mg today and follow INR in setting of abx
   .
   #. CAD: No evidence of acute ischemia on ECG. Trop mildly elevated
   0.05, 0.04, possibly element of demand ischemia with tachycardia and
   fever.
   - will start ASA 325, continue home statin
   - ROMI, monitor on telemetry
   .
   #.  Depression/Anxiety- currently on fentanyl and midazolam
   - continue home cymbalta
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no
   and shake head in response to questions.
   - continue coumadin (redose in am based on INR while on abx since
   expect to rise)
   - ASA 325

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia indicate respiratory distress. This could be due to HCAP, aspiration pneumonia, or pneumonitis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and abnormal white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, particularly if the infiltrates on the chest X-ray are indicative of pneumonia.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cool extremities and known decreased ejection fraction (EF) raise concerns about cardiogenic shock, especially if there is worsening volume overload.
4. Pulmonary edema: Although the chest X-ray does not appear consistent with pulmonary edema, the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation may still be consistent with this condition.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and invasive lines. Prophylactic anticoagulation is indicated.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, he is at"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening dyspnea
   over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to HCAP
   vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Differential diagnosis includes HCAP,
   aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema. Patient has
   history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and has failed outpatient
   regimen of levofloxacin now presenting with worsening hypoxemia and
   bibasilar infiltrates concerning for aspiration vs multifocal PNA.
   Subacute nature of symptoms with normal WBC and lack of bandemia make
   acute infection and sepsis less likely but hypotension concerning for
   evolving SIRS/sepsis in setting of abnormal CXR. CXR does not appear to
   be consistent with pulmonary edema and clinically not volume
   overloaded. Will empirically treat for PNA with HCAP/aspiration
   coverage given lives in nursing facility and has failed outpatient
   regimen.
   - Empiric antibiotics Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levoflox for now while cx
   data pending; consider d/c in 48-72 hours
   - wean  FiO2 as tolerated
   - Trend fever and WBC
   - follow up blood cx, sputum cx
   - albuterol and ipratropium MDI given wheezing, smoking history, and
   has been on them at [**Hospital3 240**]
   .
   #. Hypotension: Given time course of hypotension, likely partly related
   to sedation and infection since was not initially hypotensive in ED but
   now continues to have pressor requirement although has improved with
   IVF since arrival here. HR>90, RR>20 with UOP<0.5cc/kg/hr and lactate>2
   consistent with severe sepsis picture if infiltrates considered
   documented infection. Other possible etiologies of hypotension include
   cardiogenic shock given cool extremities and known decreased EF
   although CXR and exam not consistent with worsening volume overload.
   Lactate improved from 3.1 to 1.2
   - continue IVFs to maintain MAP>65 and UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - TTE in am
   - hold home lasix
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE [**10-13**] with EF 10% although not clinically volume
   overloaded and no evidence of worsening pulmonary edema on CXR.
   Unlikely to be in cardiogenic shock since was able to wean off pressors
   overnight.
   - redose coumadinin am for goal INR [**2-7**] for anticoagulation in setting
   of low EF
   - hold lasix for now
   - monitor fluid status closely
   .
   #. CAD: No evidence of acute ischemia on ECG, only change is worse R
   wave progression but may be [**2-6**] lead placement. Trop mildly elevated
   0.05, 0.04, possibly element of demand ischemia with tachycardia and
   fever.
   - will start ASA 325, continue home statin

   - continue home cymbalta
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no
   and shake head in response to questions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presents with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 100.8°F (38.2°C), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, as well as sedation and analgesia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea and hypoxic respiratory failure indicate a potential complication related to his underlying respiratory condition, such as HCAP or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, particularly if the suspected pneumonia progresses to an infection with systemic involvement. Frequent reassessment of vital signs, inflammatory markers, and organ function will help guide management.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's known dilated cardiomyopathy and cool extremities"

   69 yo male with history of pontine CVA, CAD, CHF-EF=10% now presenting
   with 2 weeks of dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure.   He has
   presumed aspiration as source of compromise and pneumonia leading to
   sepsis in the setting of known aspiration risk and progressive cough
   and dyspnea.
   1)       Acute Respiratory Failure-We have very vague prodrome of cough
   and dyspnea leading to admission.  This was associated with some
   worsening confusion.  The source of this compromise is presumed to be
   related to aspiration pneumonia but response has been quite quick in
   regards to resolution of sepsis.  Alternative diagnoses included are
   influenza, PE, with aspiration persisting.
   -Will continue with A/C support and move to PSV as tolerated today
   -Will continue with Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Levofloxacin
   -Will move to diurese as possible today
   -Will continue to maintain adequate PEEP
   -Will pursue Urine Legnioella
   -Patient to return to Coumadin today
   2)Sepsis- Likely pulmonary source and has had excellent response to IVF
   support now off of pressors and has had significant improvement in
   lactate with support.
   -Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Will maintain adequate diuresis today if tolerated
   -Will replace CVL as not needed at this time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, and CHF-EF=10%. He presented with two weeks of dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has presumed aspiration as the source of compromise and pneumonia leading to sepsis in the setting of known aspiration risk and progressive cough and dyspnea.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may require continued assisted ventilation and weaning to partial support as tolerated.

2. Sepsis: The patient has shown an excellent response to intravenous fluid support and has had a significant improvement in lactate levels. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the suspected pulmonary source of sepsis.

3. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. Follow-up culture results will help guide further treatment. Suctioning as needed will be performed to manage secretions.

In addition to these primary concerns, the patient requires ICU care, including nutrition through tube feeds, glycemic control, and appropriate line management. Prophylaxis measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention should also be implemented."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning for HCAP, aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema. The presence of bibasilar infiltrates and worsening hypoxemia indicates a possible infectious process at the right lower lobe and congestive heart failure (CHF) contributing to the respiratory failure.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has persistently been tachycardic throughout the day, which has improved with fluids and sedation. The cause of the tachycardia is unclear, possibly secondary to anxiety, but could also be related to volume overload or depletion.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which improved with fluid boluses. It is likely mostly related to sedation rather than cardiogenic shock.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy, possibly ischemic in origin, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10% on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). There is no evidence of acute ischemia on electrocardiogram (EKG) and the patient is unlikely to be in cardiogenic shock since they were able to wean off pressors overnight.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): There is no evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, but the patient has a history of CAD. The patient will continue on aspirin and a home statin, and will be monitored on telemetry.

Please note that the potential medical complications listed above are based on the information provided in the progress note and may not be an exhaustive list."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 87.5 kg male with a chief complaint of tachycardia. The patient's medical history includes a previous stroke (CVA) and hemorrhagic shock. The patient's current condition involves respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, impaired skin integrity, and potential sepsis. The patient is intubated and on assist-control ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 98/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F) and the patient has been persistently tachycardic throughout the day. The patient has received a total of approximately 1.5 liters of fluids and sedation with fentanyl and versed. Urine output has been low. The patient's family brought in a letterboard, and a PICC line was placed. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 171 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and moderately elevated liver enzymes. Imaging reveals severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There are no new imaging findings this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis may indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assist-control ventilation, indicating severe respiratory compromise. This could be due to the underlying cardiac dysfunction or a secondary complication such as pneumonia.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severely depressed left ventricular systolic function and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation may lead to cardiogenic shock.
5. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and cardiac dysfunction may predispose them to pulmonary edema.
6. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction, which could be due to decreased renal perfusion from the cardiac dysfunction or sepsis.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, administer appropriate antibiotics if sepsis is suspected, optimize cardiac support, and manage respiratory support. Additionally, measures should be taken to prevent and manage potential complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and stress ulcers."

   Imaging: TTE [**1-2**]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive septal akinesis, and
   hypokinesis of the inferior free wall, anterior free wall, and apex.
   There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
   dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
   abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  (MR significantly increased

   #. Hypotension: Given time course of hypotension and rapid improvement
   with fluids, likely mostly related to sedation. Lactate improved from
   3.1 to 1.2. Cardiogenic shock less likely given improvement.
   - continue gentle IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65 and UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - rate control may improve hypotension through increased CO

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a low ejection fraction and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen due to ongoing infectious processes, such as HCAP or aspiration pneumonia, or due to pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's dilated cardiomyopathy and low ejection fraction, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, particularly if the heart failure exacerbation continues or if there is further deterioration in cardiac function.
3. Arrhythmias: Tachycardia is persistent, and the patient may be at risk for arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient has a sputum culture growing gram-positive rods, and there is a need for identification and sensitivity testing. There is also a possibility of bloodstream infection.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other risk factors increase the"

   Imaging: TTE [**1-2**]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive septal akinesis, and
   hypokinesis of the inferior free wall, anterior free wall, and apex.
   There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
   dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
   abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  (MR significantly increased
   from prior)

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening dyspnea
   over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to HCAP
   vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Differential diagnosis includes HCAP,
   aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema. Patient has
   history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and has failed outpatient
   regimen of levofloxacin now presenting with worsening hypoxemia and
   bibasilar infiltrates concerning for aspiration vs multifocal PNA.
   Subacute nature of symptoms with normal WBC and lack of bandemia make
   acute infection and sepsis less likely but hypotension concerning for
   evolving SIRS/sepsis in setting of abnormal CXR. CXR today shows volume
   overload with right pleural effusion making it difficult to assess
   interval change in RLL infiltrate. Likely has both infectious process
   at RLL and CHF contributing to respiratory status.
   - sputum cx growing gram positive rods, f/u speciation/sensis
   - Empiric antibiotics Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levoflox for now while cx
   data pending
   - diuresis today with goal1-2 L neg 40 IV Lasix as needed
   - attempt to wean back to pressure support
   - Trend fever and WBC
   - follow up blood cx, sputum cx
   - albuterol and ipratropium MDI given wheezing, smoking history, and
   has been on them at [**Hospital3 240**]
   .
   # Tachycardia: unclear cause, minimally responsive to fluid boluses.
   Possibly secondary to anxiety; improved with increasing sedation. ?
   volume overload versus volume depletion?
   #. Hypotension: Given time course of hypotension and rapid improvement
   with fluids, likely mostly related to sedation. Lactate improved from
   3.1 to 1.2. Cardiogenic shock less likely given improvement.
   - continue IVFs to maintain MAP>65 and UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - f/u TTE read
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE [**10-13**] with EF 10% although not clinically volume
   overloaded and no evidence of worsening pulmonary edema on CXR.
   Unlikely to be in cardiogenic shock since was able to wean off pressors
   overnight.
   - redose coumadinin 2mg today and follow INR in setting of abx
   .
   #. CAD: No evidence of acute ischemia on ECG. Trop mildly elevated
   0.05, 0.04, possibly element of demand ischemia with tachycardia and
   fever.
   - will continue ASA, home statin

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) versus aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia indicate a respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes HCAP, aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema. The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and failure of outpatient antibiotics regimen raises concerns for aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has been persistently tachycardic throughout the day, with minimal response to fluid boluses. The cause of tachycardia is unclear, but it may be secondary to anxiety, as it improved with increasing sedation. It is uncertain whether the patient is experiencing volume overload or volume depletion.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, but with rapid improvement after fluid resuscitation. Given the time course of hypotension and improvement with fluids, it is likely mostly related to sedation. Cardiogenic shock seems less likely because the patient was able to wean off pressors overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of CVA (cerebral vascular accident) who is admitted with significant symptoms including respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, and sepsis. The patient's condition has been complex, requiring substantial fluid support to normalize blood pressure and marginal urine output.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure with pneumonia, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and a severely decreased ejection fraction (EF), indicating significant cardiomyopathy. CHF can result in pulmonary edema, fluid overload, and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a risk of developing multi-drug resistant bacteria or progression to septicemia.

4. Stroke: The patient's history of CVA puts him at risk for recurrent strokes, especially if there is an underlying atrial fibrillation or other risk factors.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of multiple central lines increase the risk of developing DVT and subsequent PE.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) versus aspiration pneumonia. The patient developed high-grade fevers over the past 24 hours after stopping antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. He has also been experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. The patient's mental status has improved off sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately managed. 
2. Infection: The development of high-grade fevers suggests a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
3. Volume Overload: The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and volume overload on the chest X-ray indicates that fluid management needs to be closely monitored to prevent further complications.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and CAD may contribute to his respiratory failure. Cardiac output may need to be optimized through rate control and afterload reduction.
5. Femoral Line Complications: The presence of a femoral line increases the risk of bloodstream infections. It is important to promptly remove the line and obtain cultures to prevent further complications.
6. Tachycardia:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) versus aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient has been experiencing high-grade fevers over the past 24 hours after stopping antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. His initial presentation included a right lower lobe infiltrate, but he likely has multifocal infiltrates complicated by volume overload and pleural effusions secondary to severe congestive heart failure (sCHF). Sputum cultures have not grown a substantial number of any one organism, and blood cultures are negative so far.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics (IV Lasix), antibiotics (Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levofloxacin), and sedation management. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.3°F (39.6°C), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/68 mmHg to 136/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

   significant issues leading to persistent respiratory failure of volume
   overload/congestive heart failure as well as persistent fever and
   concern for persistent sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Levoflox/Flagyl
   -Do have significant concern for VAP with fever and continued
   significant sputum production.  CXR is without new infiltrate but is
   difficult to confidently assess in the setting of substantial
   effusions.
   -Will resend sputum today
   -Has been on ABX for 3 days only
will continue
   -Move to PSV today and will check ABG at 60 minutes
   2)H/O CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), HEMORRHAGIC
   -Follow exam
   3)Congestive Heart Failure-
   -Lopressor 50mg tid

","Summary:
The patient is a 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and currently presenting with respiratory failure, fever, and sepsis. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for three days but still has persistent fever and significant sputum production, raising concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is also evidence of volume overload and congestive heart failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 117/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and bilateral large effusions on chest X-ray. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, while other parameters are within normal limits. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory system compliance of 100, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient is also receiving medications such as Lopressor, Lasix, Coumadin, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's persistent fever and significant sputum production despite receiving antibiotics for three days raise concerns for VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening dyspnea
   over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to HCAP
   vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Most likely,
   patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but
   also contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia, while concurrently giving
   lasix and afterload reducers to improve cardiac output.  Patient also
   had apneic episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation.
   Today mental status is improved off sedation.
   - Will continue empiric antibiotics for HCAP or VAP with
   Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levoflox
   - will attempt to rate control for improvement in cardiac output with
   metoprolol and reduce afterload with captopril
   - Continue diuresis
   - Attempt to wean to pressure support and minimize sedation for
   extubation today
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely [**2-6**] multifactorial- fever, anxiety, poor forward
   flow in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12452**]
   - cont metoprolol
   .
   #. Fever: pt developed fever over past 24 hours after levaquin and
   Flagyl were D/Ced, concerning for HAP. Also has femoral line in place.
   - Femoral line discontinued yesterday
   - cont abx as above
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.
   - Warfarin 2.5 today
   - Follow INR
   .
   #. CAD: Extensive, but stable.
   - will continue ASA, home statin
   .
   #.  Depression/Anxiety- currently on fentanyl and midazolam
   - continue home cymbalta
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no
   and shake head in response to questions.
   - continue coumadin
   - ASA 325

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been treated with empirical antibiotics for HCAP/VAP, lasix for volume overload, afterload reducers to improve cardiac output, and diuretics. He also received captopril to reduce afterload. The patient's mental status has improved off sedation, and the healthcare team plans to attempt extubation today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pulmonary infection leading to poor gas exchange and inadequate oxygenation. Continued treatment for HCAP/VAP pneumonia, along with measures to improve cardiac output, will be necessary.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be multifactorial, including fever, anxiety, and poor forward flow in the setting of mitral regurgitation (MR). Continuing metoprolol to control heart rate is recommended.
3. Fever: The patient developed a fever after discontinuing levofloxacin and Flagyl, which raises concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotic therapy should be continued as above, and the femoral line has been discontinued.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening dyspnea
   over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to HCAP
   vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Most likely,
   patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but
   also contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia, while concurrently giving
   lasix and afterload reducers to improve cardiac output.  Patient also
   had apneic episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation.
   Today mental status is improved off sedation.
   - Will continue empiric antibiotics for HCAP or VAP with
   Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levoflox
   - will attempt to rate control for improvement in cardiac output with
   metoprolol and reduce afterload with captopril as BP tolerates
   - Continue diuresis
   - Attempt to wean to pressure support and minimize sedation for
   possible extubation
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely [**2-6**] multifactorial- fever, anxiety, poor forward
   flow in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12452**]
   - Continue metoprolol
   .
   #. Fever: pt developed fever over past 24 hours after levaquin and
   Flagyl were D/Ced, concerning for HAP. Also has femoral line in place.
   - Femoral line discontinued yesterday
   - cont abx as above
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.
   - Warfarin 2.5 today
   - Follow INR
   .
   #. CAD: Extensive, but stable.
   - will continue ASA, home statin
   .
   #.  Depression/Anxiety- currently on fentanyl and midazolam
   - continue home cymbalta
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no
   and shake head in response to questions.
   - continue coumadin
   - ASA 325

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) vs aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient has been treated for HCAP/VAP pneumonia with empiric antibiotics, lasix for diuresis, afterload reducers to improve cardiac output, and weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, he continues to have tachycardia, fever, and potential barriers to extubation such as secretions, anxiety/discomfort on decreased PEEP, and strength.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea and hypoxic respiratory failure are likely due to a pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, along with poor forward flow due to volume overload. Treatment for HCAP/VAP pneumonia and diuretics are ongoing.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be multifactorial, including fever, anxiety, and poor forward flow in the setting of mitral regurgitation (MR). Metoprolol is being continued to manage the tachycardia.
3. Fever: The patient developed a fever after discontinuing levofloxacin and Flagyl, which may be concerning for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP"

He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various medications, including Lasix, captopril, vancomycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, and cefepime. His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/59 to 153/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 345, and HCO3- of 30 mEq/L. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,985 mL and output of 2,795 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -810 mL. The patient's labs indicate hypernatremia with a sodium level of 190 K/uL, elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 423 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, RSBI of 95, PIP of 11 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. The patient's arterial line was placed on 11/08/2021 at 11:08 PM, and his PICC line was placed on 11/08/2021 at 10:00 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, which can lead to neurological complications such as seizures or altered mental status.
2. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's persistent fever may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which could worsen if not identified and treated promptly.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged immobility, pressure from the endotracheal tube, or other factors. This can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration if the patient's condition worsens.
5. Line-related complications: The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and PICC line. There is a risk of infection or thrombosis associated with these lines, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom chronic CVS syndrome, now s/p sepsis and persistent respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Attributed to pneumonia and in part CHF (acute
   on chronic).  Remains mechanically ventilated, and poor RSBI.
   Secretions clearing in color, but remain copious today.  CXR with
   persistent bibasilar densities (effusions +/- inflitrates).  Continue
   emirical vancomycin, cefopime, levo and flagyl for complete course
   HCAP.  Desire net diuresis if tolerates.
   SEPSIS -- s/p vasopressors and resussitation.  Improved.  Monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   CHF -- chronic systolic dysfunction (cardiomyopathy EF= 10-20% and MR)
   with component of acute decompenstation in context of sepsis.  Continue
   b-blocker and ACE-inhibitor as tolerated, and net diurese (if
   tolerates).
   FLUIDS -- net volume expanded in context of volume resussitation.
   Desire to net dirurese if tolerates.
   H/O CVA --  neurologically 'locked-in' as baseline.  Fascibulations of
   tongue and lip.  Able to an communicate with eye movement (look up for
   ""yes"").  Continue coumadin, maintain PT INR.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with chronic cardiovascular syndrome who has developed respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia and in part congestive heart failure (acute on chronic). He remains mechanically ventilated and has poor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The patient's secretions are clear in color but remain copious. A chest X-ray shows persistent bibasilar densities (effusions +/- infiltrates). 

The patient is also being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with empirical vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The plan is to continue these antibiotics for a complete course. Net diuresis is desired if tolerated. 

The patient had an episode of sepsis post vasopressors and resuscitation but has improved. Vital signs are to be monitored. Hypotension has resolved, and blood pressure is to be maintained with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 60 mmHg.

The patient has chronic systolic dysfunction with cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 10-20%) and mitral regurgitation (MR) with acute decompression in the context of sepsis. Continuation of beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor as tolerated, along with net diuresis (if tolerated), is planned.

Fluid management is a concern due to volume resuscitation. The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with neurologic ""locked-in"" syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   yom chronic CVS syndrome, now s/p sepsis and persistent respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Attributed to pneumonia and in part CHF (acute
   on chronic).  Remains mechanically ventilated, and poor RSBI.
   Secretions clearing, but remain copious today.  CXR with persistent
   bibasilar densities (effusions +/- inflitrates).  Continue vancomycin,
   cefopime, levo and flagyl.  Desire net diuresis if tolerates.
   SEPSIS -- s/p vasopressors and resussitation.  Improved.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   CHF -- chronic systolic dysfunction (cardiomyopathy EF= 10-20% and MR)
   with component of acute decompenstation in context of sepsis.  Continue
   b-blocker and ACE-inhibitor as tolerated, and net diurese.
   FLUIDS -- net volume expanded in context of volume resussitation.
   Desire to net dirurese if tolerates.
   H/O CVA --  neurologically 'locked-in' as baseline.  Fascibulations of
   tongue and lip.  Able to an communicate with eye movement (look up for
   ""yes"").  Continue coumadin, maintain PT INR.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Levoflox/Flagyl
   -Do have significant concern for VAP with fever and continued
   significant sputum production.  CXR is without new infiltrate but is
   difficult to confidently assess in the setting of substantial
   effusions.
   -Will resend sputum today
   -Has been on ABX for 3 days only
will continue
   -Move to PSV today and will check ABG at 60 minutes
   2)H/O CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), HEMORRHAGIC
   -Follow exam
   3)Congestive Heart Failure-
   -Lopressor 50mg tid
   -Will need to add Captopril at 6.25mg and titrate up
   -Lasix as needed to effect diuresis as first step today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated due to pneumonia and acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's secretions are copious, and their respiratory system instability index (RSBI) is poor. A chest X-ray shows persistent bibasilar densities, which may indicate effusions or infiltrates. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and flagyl. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to fever and significant sputum production. The patient has a history of chronic cardiovascular syndrome, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and sepsis. They also have chronic systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 10-20% and mitral regurgitation. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but they require ongoing monitoring and maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg. Fluid balance management is necessary due to volume resuscitation. The patient's neurological status is consistent with ""locked-in syndrome,"" with fasciculations of the tongue and lip but able to communicate through eye movements. Coumadin is being continued, and PT INR should be maintained. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia and acute on chronic CHF. There is"

   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Most likely,
   patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but
   also contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient postive 2 liters
   yesterday, will consider more aggressive diuresis today.  Patient also
   had apneic episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation;
   mental status is improved off sedation.
   - Will continue empiric antibiotics for HCAP or VAP with
   Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levoflox
   - will attempt to rate control for improvement in cardiac output with
   metoprolol and reduce afterload with captopril as BP tolerates

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%), and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be secondary to HCAP versus aspiration PNA/pneumonitis versus CHF. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure. He is also experiencing tachycardia, fever, and has a history of cardiomyopathy, CAD, depression/anxiety, and pontine infarct.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to pulmonary infection leading to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis, as well as poor forward flow caused by volume overload. Treatment for HCAP/VAP pneumonia is ongoing, and more aggressive diuresis is being considered.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be multifactorial, including fever, anxiety, and poor forward flow in the setting of mitral regurgitation. Medications such as metoprolol and captopril will be continued to rate-control and reduce afterload.
3. Fever: The patient developed a fever after discontinuing levofloxacin and Flagyl, which may be concerning for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy will be continued as above"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening dyspnea
   over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to HCAP
   vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Most likely,
   patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but
   also contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia, while concurrently giving
   lasix and afterload reducers to improve cardiac output.  Patient also
   had apneic episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation.
   Today mental status is improved off sedation.
   - Will continue empiric antibiotics for HCAP or VAP with
   Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levoflox
   - will attempt to rate control for improvement in cardiac output with
   metoprolol and reduce afterload with captopril as BP tolerates
   - Continue diuresis
   - Attempt to wean to pressure support and minimize sedation for
   possible extubation
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely [**2-6**] multifactorial- fever, anxiety, poor forward
   flow in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12452**]
   - Continue metoprolol
   .
   #. Fever: pt developed fever over past 24 hours after levaquin and
   Flagyl were D/Ced, concerning for HAP. Also has femoral line in place.
   - Femoral line discontinued yesterday
   - cont abx as above
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.
   - Warfarin 2.5 today
   - Follow INR
   .
   #. CAD: Extensive, but stable.
   - will continue ASA, home statin
   .
   #.  Depression/Anxiety- currently on fentanyl and midazolam
   - continue home cymbalta
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no
   and shake head in response to questions.
   - continue coumadin
   - ASA 325
   BARRIERS TO EXTUBATION:  Secretions, anxiety/discomfort on decreased

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) versus aspiration pneumonia (PNA)/pneumonitis.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a pulmonary infection leading to poor forward flow due to volume overload. Treatment includes continuing empiric antibiotics for HCAP or VAP, attempting to rate control with metoprolol, reducing afterload with captopril, continuing diuresis, and minimizing sedation for possible extubation.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, including fever, anxiety, and poor forward flow in the setting of mitral regurgitation (MR). Treatment includes continuing metoprolol.

3. Fever: The patient developed a fever over the past 24 hours after discontinuing levofloxacin and Flagyl, which is concerning for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Discontinuation of the femoral line and continued antibiotics are planned.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has unclear etiology cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic and related to dysnychromy. A transthoracic echoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of pontine stroke and is unable to provide medical history. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing apnea on current vent settings. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. Blood cultures from the central venous line revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient's laboratory results indicate hypernatremia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated troponin levels. Physical examination reveals copious secretions, weak gag reflex, edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. The patient has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation puts him at risk for developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular chest x-rays should be performed.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of edema in both lower extremities increases the risk of DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and skin coloration, along with consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation, is important.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's warm skin and impaired mobility due to pontine stroke may lead to pressure ulcers. Frequent repositioning and careful skin assessment are crucial.
4. Sepsis: The patient"

   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, [**Month (only) 12475**] cardiomyopathy LVEF 20%, and
   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Most likely,
   patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but
   also contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient postive 2 liters
   yesterday, will consider more aggressive diuresis today.  Patient also
   had apneic episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation;
   mental status is improved off sedation.
   - Will continue empiric antibiotics for HCAP or VAP with
   Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levoflox
   - will attempt to rate control for improvement in cardiac output with
   metoprolol and reduce afterload with captopril as BP tolerates
   - diuresis
 consider lasix gtt with metolazone today if lasix IV PRN
   dosing does not achieve diuresis
   - wean to pressure support and minimize sedation for possible
   extubation
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   - cont current MMV vent settings, diuresis will hopefully optimize
   ventilation
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely [**2-6**] multifactorial- fever, anxiety, poor forward
   flow in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12475**] systolic CHF
   - Continue metoprolol, ACEi, diuresis
   .
   #. Fever: pt developed fever over past 24 hours after levaquin and
   Flagyl were D/Ced, concerning for HAP. Also has femoral line in place.
   Afebrile past 24 hours.
   - Femoral line discontinued 2 days ago
   - cont abx as above
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.
   - Warfarin 2.5 today
   - Follow INR
   - diuresis as above
   .
   #. CAD: Extensive, but stable.
   - will continue ASA, home statin
   .
   #.  Depression/Anxiety- currently on fentanyl and midazolam
   - continue home cymbalta
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes hypoxic respiratory failure due to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), aspiration pneumonia, or congestive heart failure (CHF).

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, and poor forward flow due to volume overload. He will continue to be treated for HCAP/VAP pneumonia. The patient is positive for 2 liters yesterday, and more aggressive diuresis will be considered today. He also had apneic episodes on pressure support ventilation and required airway clearance, likely due to oversedation. Mental status has improved off sedation.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has a likely multifactorial tachycardia, possibly related to fever, anxiety, and poor forward flow in the setting of mitral regurgitation. Metoprolol, ACE inhibitor, and diuresis will be continued.

3. Fever: The patient developed fever over the past 24 hours after discontinuing Levofloxacin and Flagyl, which is concerning for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). However, the patient is currently afebrile. The femoral line was"

   70 yom chronic CVS syndrome, now s/p sepsis and persistent respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Attributed to pneumonia and in part CHF (acute
   on chronic).  Remains mechanically ventilated, and poor RSBI.
   Secretions clearing in color, but remain copious today.  CXR with
   persistent bibasilar densities (effusions +/- inflitrates).  Continue
   emirical vancomycin, cefopime, levo and flagyl for complete course
   HCAP.  Desire net diuresis if tolerates.  hopefully will be able to
   work towards SBT once able to net diureses.
   SEPSIS -- s/p vasopressors and resussitation.  Improved.  Monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 likley pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of CHF.
   Continue antimicrobials and attempt to net diurese.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC, likely line repated infection, although may be
   related to sepsis/pneumonia.  Central line d/c'd and await final
   identification of GPC organism.
   CHF -- chronic systolic dysfunction (cardiomyopathy EF= 10-20% and MR)
   with component of acute decompenstation in context of sepsis.  Continue
   b-blocker and ACE-inhibitor as tolerated, and net diurese (if
   tolerates).  Continue anticoagulation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with chronic cardiovascular syndrome who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia and acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient remains mechanically ventilated and has poor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). 

The patient's history is significant for chronic systolic dysfunction with cardiomyopathy and moderate mitral regurgitation. He also has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), resulting in ""locked-in"" syndrome, where he is unable to speak or move voluntarily but can communicate through eye movements.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor for CHF management. He is also on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 124/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.3 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T level of 2.0 ng/mL. Other lab values, including kidney function tests,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with chronic cardiovascular syndrome who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to pneumonia and acute on chronic heart failure. The patient has a history of sepsis and bacteremia, which have been treated with antibiotics. He also has chronic systolic dysfunction with acute decompensation in the context of sepsis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fluid overload, and ""locked-in"" syndrome due to a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper ventilation strategies and adherence to VAP prevention protocols are necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation should be continued.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged bed rest. Prophylactic therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be maintained.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload as indicated by the positive fluid balance and edema in the lower extremities. Close monitoring and diuresis may be necessary.
5. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, there is still a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, [**Year (4 digits) 12475**] cardiomyopathy LVEF 20%, and
   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Most likely,
   patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but
   also contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We are
   continuing to diurese to optimize for possible extubation. We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient also had apneic
   episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation; mental status
   is improved off sedation.
   - scopolamine patch for secretions
   - Will continue empiric antibiotics for HCAP or VAP with Vanco
   (D7)/ceftaz (D2)
   - cont rate control and reduce afterload with metoprolol/captopril
   - diuresis
lasix IV with metolazone [**Hospital1 7**] today, goal TBB -2L
   - wean to pressure support and minimize sedation for possible
   extubation, NPO at MN
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   .
   #. HAP: Has pseudomonas in sputum, switched from cefepime to
   ceftazidime yesterday. Afebrile, no leukocytosis, and decreasing
   secretions.
   - cont ceftaz/vanco as above
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to diuresis in the setting of being NPO
   intermittently and minimal free water intake.
   - increase free water boluses to 150 cc q4h
   - PM lytes
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely [**2-6**] multifactorial- fever, anxiety, poor forward
   flow in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12475**] systolic CHF
   - Continue metoprolol, ACEi, diuresis
   .
   #. Fever: No fevers for past 48 hours. 1 positive blood cx growing
   CoNS. Likely was transiently bacteremic from femoral line.
   - cont abx as above
   - repeat cx if spikes
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine cerebrovascular accident (CVA), coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis versus congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, with poor forward flow due to volume overload.
2. Tachycardia: Multifactorial causes including fever, anxiety, and poor forward flow in the setting of mitral regurgitation (MR) systolic CHF.
3. Fever: Transiently bacteremic from femoral line.
4. Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior. CHF is likely contributing to respiratory failure.
5. CAD: Extensive but stable.
6. Depression/Anxiety: Currently on fentanyl and midazolam.
7. History of pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no and shake head in response to questions.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom chronic CVS syndrome, now s/p sepsis and persistent respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Attributed to pneumonia and in part CHF (acute
   on chronic).  Remains mechanically ventilated, and poor RSBI.
   Secretions clearing in color, but remain copious today.  CXR with
   persistent bibasilar densities (effusions +/- inflitrates).  Continue
   emirical vancomycin, cefopime, levo and flagyl for complete course
   HCAP.  Desire net diuresis if tolerates.  hopefully will be able to
   work towards SBT once able to net diureses.  Need to assess if episodes
   of apnea resolved.
   SEPSIS -- s/p vasopressors and resussitation.  Improved.  Monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 likely pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of CHF.
   Continue antimicrobials (ceftazadime, Levo, Vanco) and continue to net
   diurese.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC, likely line repated infection, although may be
   related to sepsis/pneumonia.  Central line d/c'd and await final
   identification of GPC organism.  F/U blood cultures.
   CHF -- chronic systolic dysfunction (cardiomyopathy EF= 10-20% and MR)
   with component of acute decompenstation in context of sepsis.  Continue
   b-blocker and ACE-inhibitor as tolerated, and net diurese (if
   tolerates).  Continue anticoagulation.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- increase free water bolus via PEG.
   FLUIDS -- net volume expanded in context of volume resussitation.
   Desire to net dirurese if tolerates.
   H/O CVA --  neurologically 'locked-in' as baseline.  Fascibulations of
   tongue and lip.  Able to an communicate with eye movement (look up for
   ""yes"").  Continue coumadin, maintain PT INR.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with chronic cardiovascular syndrome who is currently in the ICU for sepsis and persistent respiratory failure. The patient remains mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia and acute on chronic heart failure. The patient's respiratory status has shown some improvement, with clearing of secretions in color but remaining copious.

The patient's medical history includes chronic systolic dysfunction with cardiomyopathy and mitral regurgitation, leading to acute decompensation in the context of sepsis. He also has a history of ischemic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), resulting in ""locked-in"" syndrome. The patient is able to communicate with eye movements and has fasciculations of the tongue and lip.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 112/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on mechanical ventilation. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,704 mL and output of 2,850 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -146 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 225 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 132 to 152 mg/dL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 mg/dL, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom chronic CVS syndrome, now s/p sepsis and persistent respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Attributed to pneumonia and in part CHF (acute
   on chronic).  Remains mechanically ventilated, and poor RSBI.
   Secretions clearing in color, but remain copious today.  CXR with
   persistent bibasilar densities (effusions +/- inflitrates).  Continue
   emirical vancomycin, cefopime, levo and flagyl for complete course
   HCAP.  Desire net diuresis if tolerates.  hopefully will be able to
   work towards SBT once able to net diureses.  Need to assess if episodes
   of apnea resolved.
   SEPSIS -- s/p vasopressors and resussitation.  Improved.  Monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 attributed in part to pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   component of CHF with pleural effusions.  Continue antimicrobials
   (ceftazadime, Levo, Vanco) and continue to net diurese.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC, likely line repated infection, although may be
   related to sepsis/pneumonia.  Central line d/c'd and await final
   identification of GPC organism.  F/U blood cultures.
   CHF -- chronic systolic dysfunction (cardiomyopathy EF= 10-20% and MR)
   with component of acute decompenstation in context of sepsis.  Continue
   b-blocker and ACE-inhibitor as tolerated, and net diurese (if
   tolerates).  Continue anticoagulation.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- increase free water bolus via PEG.
   FLUIDS -- net volume expanded in context of volume resussitation.
   Desire to net dirurese if tolerates.
   H/O CVA --  neurologically 'locked-in' as baseline.  Fascibulations of
   tongue and lip.  Able to an communicate with eye movement (look up for
   ""yes"").  Continue coumadin, maintain PT INR.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with chronic cardiovascular syndrome who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF), and is still mechanically ventilated. His recent laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, blood glucose, and creatinine. The patient is also hypotensive and has evidence of pulmonary infiltrates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia and CHF. It is important to closely monitor his oxygenation and ventilation status, as well as the secretions in his trachea.
2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of improvement after receiving vasopressors and resuscitation. However, it is crucial to monitor his vital signs and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but it is important to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
4. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient's pulmonary infiltrates may be a result of pneumonia or CHF. It is necessary to continue antimicrobial therapy and diuretic administration to manage this condition.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, likely due to a central line infection. It is important to remove the central line and wait for the identification of the organism causing the infection.

   Disposition:
","The patient presented with hypoxia and was intubated. They have a history of stroke, hemorrhagic shock, and septic shock. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. Their FiO2 is set at 40%. They have been receiving multiple antibiotics including cefipime, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. The patient's sodium level was elevated, so they received free water boluses, which helped improve their sodium levels to 140.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits, with a blood pressure on the lower end of the normal range. Their respiratory rate is set at 12 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 100% on the ventilator. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Their blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal limits. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,184 mL and output of 4,725 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,541 mL. This suggests ongoing fluid losses.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypernatremia, respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung injury, impaired skin integrity leading to pressure ulcers,"

   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Most likely,
   patient has pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but
   also contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We are
   continuing to diurese to optimize for possible extubation. We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient also had apneic
   episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation; mental status
   has improved off sedation.
   - scopolamine patch for secretions
   - Will continue empiric antibiotics for HCAP or VAP with Vanco
   (D8)/ceftaz (D3), levofloxacin D8
   - cont rate control and reduce afterload with metoprolol/captopril

   ceftazidime yesterday. Afebrile, no leukocytosis, and decreasing
   secretions.
   - cont ceftaz/vanco as above

   #  Metabolic alkalosis- likely [**2-6**] volume contraction, bicarb trending
   up in setting of diuresis, now 40
   -  will consider holding lasix and metolazone this morning
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to diuresis in the setting of being NPO
   intermittently and minimal free water intake.  Corrected with free
   water boluses.
   - PRN free water boluses to 150 cc q4h
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely [**2-6**] multifactorial- fever, anxiety, poor forward
   flow in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12475**] systolic CHF
   - Continue metoprolol, ACEi, diuresis

   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine cerebrovascular accident (CVA), coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) versus aspiration pneumonia versus congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a pulmonary infection leading to poor oxygenation. This could be secondary to HCAP, aspiration pneumonia, or CHF.
2. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient has pseudomonas in his sputum, indicating a possible infection. This requires appropriate antibiotic treatment.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may be caused by volume contraction and diuresis. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to diuresis and minimal free water intake. It should be corrected with free water boluses.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia, which may be multifactorial including fever, anxiety, and poor forward flow in the setting of mitral reg"

   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Patient may have
   had pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but also likely
   contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We are
   continuing to diurese to optimize for possible extubation. We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient also had apneic
   episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation; mental status
   has improved off sedation.  Diuresis limited by BP, switched to lasix
   gtt with improved hemodynamics.
   - scopolamine patch for secretions
   - Will continue ceftaz, today day [**4-14**]
   - cont rate control and reduce afterload with metoprolol/captopril
   - diuresis
lasix gtt with metolazone [**Hospital1 7**] today, goal (-) 2 liters
   - wean to pressure support and minimize sedation for possible
   extubation, cont NPO at 4 a.m.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   .
   #. HAP: Has pseudomonas in sputum, switched from cefepime to
   ceftazidime. Afebrile, no leukocytosis, and decreasing secretions.
   - cont ceftaz as above
   .
   #  Metabolic alkalosis- likely [**2-6**] volume contraction, bicarb trending
   up in setting of diuresis, now 40
   -  will cont diuresis, KCl supplementation, check chem. 7 at 13:00
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to diuresis in the setting of being NPO
   intermittently and minimal free water intake.  Corrected with free
   water boluses.
   - PRN free water boluses to 150 cc q4h
   .
   # Right Greater Saphenous vein thrombus: Does not extend into common
   femoral vein.  Family considering IVC filter.  Will not change warfarin
   in interim.
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely [**2-6**] multifactorial- fever, anxiety, poor forward
   flow in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12475**] systolic CHF
   - Continue metoprolol, ACEi, diuresis
   .
   #. Fever: No fevers for past 72 hours. 1 positive blood cx growing
   CoNS. Likely was transiently bacteremic from femoral line.
   - cont abx as above
   - repeat cx if spikes
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.
   - Warfarin 2.5
   - Follow INR

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) versus aspiration pneumonia versus congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, potentially due to pulmonary infection leading to poor oxygenation, as well as poor forward flow due to volume overload. Diuretics are being used to optimize the patient for possible extubation.
2. HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia): The patient has pseudomonas in his sputum, and antibiotics have been switched from cefepime to ceftazidime. He is afebrile, with no leukocytosis and decreasing secretions.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient likely has volume contraction with bicarbonate trending up during diuresis. Diuresis, KCl supplementation, and monitoring of electrolytes are planned.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels due to diuresis, being NPO intermittently, and minimal free water intake. Free water boluses are being administered to correct the hypernatremia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes a hemorrhagic stroke, septic shock, and DVT in the saphenous vein extending to the femoral vein. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently receiving multiple medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, and pain management. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/63 mmHg to 107/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.2°C.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated sodium levels, slightly low potassium levels, and normal renal function. Imaging reveals a thrombus in the right greater saphenous vein as it enters the common femoral vein, but no thrombus is seen within the common femoral vein. The patient's ECG shows rare bigeminy.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes hypernatremia (high sodium), fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), history of CVA (stroke), hemorrhagic shock, and septic shock. The ICU care plan includes nutritional support through enteral feeding, glycemic control, and appropriate lines in place. Prophylactic measures are being taken for DVT,"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, [**Year (4 digits) 12475**] cardiomyopathy LVEF 20%, and
   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Patient may have
   had pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but also likely
   contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We are
   continuing to diurese to optimize for possible extubation. We will
   continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient also had apneic
   episodes on PSV and required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation; mental status
   has improved off sedation.  Diuresis limited by BP, switched to lasix
   gtt with improved hemodynamics.
   - scopolamine patch for secretions
   - Will continue ceftaz, today day [**4-14**]
   - cont rate control and reduce afterload with metoprolol/captopril
   - diuresis
lasix gtt with metolazone [**Hospital1 7**] today, goal (-) 2 liters
   - wean to pressure support and minimize sedation for possible
   extubation, cont NPO at 4 a.m.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   .
   #. HAP: Has pseudomonas in sputum, switched from cefepime to
   ceftazidime. Afebrile, no leukocytosis, and decreasing secretions.
   - cont ceftaz as above
   .
   #  Metabolic alkalosis- likely [**2-6**] volume contraction, bicarb trending
   up in setting of diuresis, now 40
   -  will cont diuresis, KCl supplementation, check chem. 7 at 13:00
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to diuresis in the setting of being NPO
   intermittently and minimal free water intake.  Corrected with free
   water boluses.
   - PRN free water boluses to 150 cc q4h
   .
   # Right Greater Saphenous vein thrombus: Does not extend into common
   femoral vein.  Family considering IVC filter.  Will not change warfarin
   in interim.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure. The possible causes include HCAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia), aspiration pneumonia, or CHF (Congestive heart failure). The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including HAP (Hospital-acquired pneumonia), metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, right greater saphenous vein thrombus, tachycardia, fever, cardiomyopathy, CAD, and depression/anxiety. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's main issue at the moment is hypoxic respiratory failure. It is essential to optimize his condition for possible extubation.
2. HAP: The patient has developed hospital-acquired pneumonia, which requires appropriate antibiotic treatment.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to volume contraction. Close monitoring and correction with KCl supplementation are necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, possibly caused by diuresis and minimal free water intake. Free water boluses will be needed to correct this.
5. Right greater saphenous vein thrombus: The patient has a clot in the right greater saphenous vein, which should be"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), aspiration pneumonia, or congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient has been receiving various treatments including diuretics, antibiotics, and sedation. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/51 to 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is on mechanical ventilation with minimal support.

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities such as metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. He also has a positive blood culture for CoNS, which may indicate a transient bacteremia from a femoral line.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to several factors such as pulmonary infection, poor forward flow due to volume overload, or CHF. The treatment plan includes optimizing the patient's hemodynamics through diuresis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%), and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes HCAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia), aspiration pneumonia, and CHF (Congestive heart failure). The patient has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a pulmonary infection leading to poor oxygenation. It is also possible that the patient's poor forward flow due to volume overload is contributing to the respiratory failure. The medical team is continuing to diurese the patient to optimize for possible extubation.
2. Pseudomonas infection: The patient has pseudomonas in his sputum, indicating a potential infection. The medical team has switched antibiotics from cefepime to ceftazidime to cover for pseudomonas.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to volume contraction and diuresis. The bicarb is trending up in the setting of diuresis, but now at 40.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to diuresis in the setting of being NPO intermittently and minimal free water intake. The medical team is correcting"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, [**Year (4 digits) 12475**] cardiomyopathy LVEF 20%, and
   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Patient may have
   had pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but also likely
   contributing is poor forward flow due to volume overload.  We are
   continuing to diurese to optimize for possible extubation, possibly
   [**2114-1-12**]. Patient was 4L negative yesterday!  We will continue to treat
   for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient also had apneic episodes on PSV and
   required AC, likely [**2-6**] oversedation; mental status has improved off
   sedation.  Diuresis limited by BP, switched to lasix gtt with improved
   hemodynamics.  Patient continues to do well on vent on MMV with minimal
   support.
   - scopolamine patch for secretions
   - Will continue ceftaz, today day [**6-14**]
   - diuresis
lasix gtt with metolazone [**Hospital1 7**] today, goal (-) 4 liters
   - cont rate control and reduce afterload with metoprolol/captopril
   - weaned to pressure support [**10-14**] and we are minimizing sedation for
   possible extubation
   - Attempt to minimize Alkalemia with KCL PRN given progressive
   alkalemia with both low chloride and diuresis
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   .
   #. HAP: Has pseudomonas in sputum, switched from cefepime to
   ceftazidime. Afebrile, no leukocytosis, and decreasing secretions.
   - cont ceftaz as above
   .
   #  Metabolic alkalosis- likely [**2-6**] diuresis, bicarb trending up in
   setting of diuresis, now 43.
   -  will cont diuresis, KCl supplementation, check chem. 7 TID with
   aggressive KCL
   -  one time dose of acetazolamide today
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Corrected with free water boluses.
   - PRN free water boluses to 150 cc q4h
   .
   # Right Greater Saphenous vein thrombus: Does not extend into common
   femoral vein.  Family considering IVC filter.  Will not change warfarin
   in interim.
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely [**2-6**] multifactorial- fever, anxiety, poor forward
   flow in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12475**] systolic CHF
   - Continue metoprolol, ACEi, diuresis
   .
   #. Fever: No fevers for past 5 days. 1 positive blood cx growing CoNS.
   Likely was transiently bacteremic from femoral line.
   - cont abx as above
   - repeat cx if spikes
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.
   - increased warfarin to 3 mg daily
   - Follow INR
   - diuresis as above
   .
   #. CAD: Extensive, but stable.
   - will continue ASA, home statin
   .
   #.  Depression/Anxiety- currently on fentanyl and midazolam
   - continue lexapro
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no
   and shake head in response to questions.
   - continue coumadin
   - ASA 325
   .
   #  FEN
 no IVF, [**Hospital1 7**] lytes with diuresis, on tube feeds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, cardiomyopathy with LVEF 20%, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs CHF.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for HCAP/VAP pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation with minimal support. Diuresis is being continued to optimize for possible extubation.
- Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has bicarbonate trending up due to diuresis. Aggressive KCL supplementation is being given to address this issue.
- Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are corrected with free water boluses.
- Right Greater Saphenous vein thrombus: The patient has a thrombus that does not extend into the common femoral vein. Family is considering an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Warfarin therapy will not be changed in the interim.
- Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, including fever, anxiety, and poor forward flow due to volume overload. Medications such as metoprolol, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics are being continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs CHF. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, HAP (pseudomonas in sputum), metabolic alkalosis (likely due to diuresis), right greater saphenous vein thrombus, cardiomyopathy (ischemic and related to dysnychromy), CAD, depression/anxiety, h/o pontine infarct, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory failure due to underlying pulmonary infection and poor forward flow caused by volume overload.
2. HAP: The patient may develop further complications related to the pseudomonas infection in the sputum.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen due to ongoing diuresis and bicarbonate supplementation.
4. Right Greater Saphenous Vein Thrombus: The patient may have an increased risk of thromboembolic events.
5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy may contribute to respiratory failure and further cardiac complications.
6. CAD: The patient's extensive and stable CAD may lead to cardiovascular events.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%), and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs CHF. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, HAP (pseudomonas in sputum), metabolic alkalosis, right greater saphenous vein thrombus, cardiomyopathy, CAD, depression/anxiety, and h/o pontine infarct.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory failure due to pulmonary infection, worsening CHF, or poor forward flow.
2. HAP (Pseudomonas in sputum): There is a risk of continued infection with Pseudomonas, despite being on ceftazidime.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient may develop worsening metabolic alkalosis due to aggressive diuresis and bicarbonate trending up.
4. Right Greater Saphenous Vein Thrombus: There is a risk of further clot progression or embolization.
5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy may worsen, leading to continued heart failure symptoms.
6. CAD: The patient's extensive CAD may lead to further cardiac events.
7. Depression/Anxiety: The patient"

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal support but has low VT when weaned down to PSV. He also has central muscle weakness, as indicated by a NIF of -5 yesterday. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient may have had pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but more relevant is likely worsening CHF and poor forward flow. The plan is to continue diuresis to optimize for extubation on [**2114-1-15**]. The patient is now -650cc for LOS, and BUN/Cr rising. 
2. HAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia): The patient has pseudomonas in sputum and is on ceftazidime. He is afebrile, with no leukocytosis, and decreasing secretions.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: This is likely due to [**2-6**] diuresis, bicarb trending up in the setting of diuresis. The patient will have a greater chance of weaning off the vent in the setting of alkalosis (will need smaller tidal volumes to"

   Patient with high RSBI. Oxygenation good on FIO2 0.3, VE 5-6L/min. The
   patient is acting as if muscle weakness is his major impediment to
   getting off the ventilator. We are trying to reduce the mechanical load

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, chronic heart failure, and pneumonia. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with PSV mode. The patient's oxygenation is good, but they have a high RSBI (Respiratory System Impedance). The patient's main obstacle to being taken off the ventilator seems to be muscle weakness. There is evidence of low intravascular volume, as indicated by clear lung fields, low oxygen requirements, and a high BUN/creatinine ratio. Pleural effusions may be contributing to the mechanical problems. The patient has metabolic alkalosis from diuresis and low potassium levels, which are being repleted. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of around 0.5 L. The patient is receiving nutritional support through a pulmonary formula and has an arterial line, PICC line, and is on systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. Stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia) prevention measures are also in place. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is expected to stay in the ICU."

The patient is a 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, but they are currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume of 200mL, respiratory rate of 700s, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 30%. The patient has undergone several interventions including diuresis, repletion of potassium chloride, discontinuation of Diamox, and consideration of a CT-guided tap due to a pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and they are well-nourished without acute distress. Laboratory results show mild abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function but are otherwise stable. The patient's medical history includes a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory secretions and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
3. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy LVEF 20%, and
   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Patient may have
   had pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure, but more
   relevant is likely worsening CHF and poor forward flow.  We are
   continuing to diurese to optimize for extubation on [**2114-1-15**]. Patient is
   now -650cc for LOS, and BUN/Cr rising.  We will continue to treat for
   HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient on MMV with minimal support but has low VT
   when weaned down to PSV to [**5-9**]. NIF -5 yesterday so central muscle
   weakness also a significant problem.
   - repeat NIF
   - scopolamine patch for secretions
   - Will continue ceftaz, today day [**8-14**]
   - diuresis
lasix gtt with metolazone [**Hospital1 7**] for goal -500cc today and
   reassess after PM lytes
   - consult IP for possible bedside tap today
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   - extubate tomorrow vs. Monday and do not re-intubate
   .
   #. HAP: Has pseudomonas in sputum, on ceftazidime. Afebrile, no
   leukocytosis, and decreasing secretions.
   - cont ceftaz as above
   .
   #  Metabolic alkalosis- likely [**2-6**] diuresis, bicarb trending up in
   setting of diuresis. Patient will have greater chance of weaning off
   the vent in setting of alkalosis (will need smaller tidal volumes to
   ventilate)
   - KCl supplementation prn
   - D/C diamox
   .
   # Right Greater Saphenous vein thrombus: Does not extend into common
   femoral vein.  IVC filter not indicated or wanted by family.  Will not
   change warfarin in interim.
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.
   - increased warfarin to 5 mg daily
   - Follow INR and dose appropriately
   - diuresis as above
   - cont rate control and reduce afterload with metoprolol/captopril
   .
   #. CAD: Extensive, but stable.
   - will continue ASA, home statin
   .
   #.  Depression/Anxiety- currently on fentanyl and midazolam
   - continue lexapro
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no
   and shake head in response to questions.
   - continue coumadin
   - ASA 325

   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy LVEF 20%, and
   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Possible pulmonary
   infection leading to respiratory failure, but more relevant is likely
   worsening CHF and poor forward flow.  Continuing diuresis to optimize
   for extubation on [**2114-1-15**]. Patient is now -1300 cc for LOS, and BUN/Cr
   rising.  We will continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient on
   MMV with minimal support but has low VT when weaned down to PSV to [**5-9**].
   NIF -5 2 days ago so central muscle weakness also a significant
   problem.  [**Name (NI) 1398**] 114.
   - repeat NIF
   - scopolamine patch for secretions
   - Will continue ceftaz, today day [**9-14**]
   - diuresis
lasix gtt with metolazone [**Hospital1 7**] for goal -1000 cc today and
   reassess after PM lytes
   - consult IP for possible bedside tap
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   - likely extubate Monday and do not re-intubate
   .
   #. HAP: Has pseudomonas in sputum, on ceftazidime. Afebrile, no
   leukocytosis, and decreasing secretions.
   - cont ceftaz as above
   .
   #  Metabolic alkalosis- likely [**2-6**] diuresis, bicarb trending up in
   setting of diuresis. Patient will have greater chance of weaning off
   the vent in setting of alkalosis (will need smaller tidal volumes to
   ventilate)
   - KCl supplementation prn
   - D/C diamox
   - will monitor Na
   .
   # Right Greater Saphenous vein thrombus: Does not extend into common
   femoral vein.  IVC filter not indicated or wanted by family.  Will not
   change warfarin in interim.
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.  INR
   subtherapeutic for past 3 days.
   - increased warfarin to 7.5 mg daily
   - Follow INR and dose appropriately
   - diuresis as above
   - cont rate control and reduce afterload with metoprolol/captopril
   .
   #. CAD: Extensive, but stable.   Episode of chest pain this morning
   resolved with morphine.  Low suspicion for mycocardial ischemia.  Will
   repeat ECG, as pt  is now pain free.

   HYPERNATREMIA
   ============
   Patient tolerating lower degree of ventilator support. CXR improved
   with respect to pleural effusions. Will continue diuresis in effort to
   increase lung compliance, further reduce size of effusions, and reduce
   work of breathing and facilitate extubation. On rounds this AM, patient
   placed on CPAP 5 with VT 350 and respiratory rate 25-30. Will continue
   to observe him on these settings. With additional diuresis, may be
   ready for extubation tomorrow.
   Will replete free water; diuresis likely explanation for hypernatremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU with respiratory failure and pleural effusions. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PSV mode, set at 5 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 30%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/53 to 129/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction) and hemorrhagic pleural effusions. Lab results show elevated sodium levels (147 mEq/L) and decreased potassium levels (3.0 mEq/L). The patient has been tolerating lower degrees of ventilator support, and their CXR has improved with reduced pleural effusions. The plan is to continue diuresis to increase lung compliance, reduce effusion size, and facilitate extubation. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently on an antibiotic regimen of ceftazidime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Strict adherence to VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy LVEF 20%, and
   recurrent aspiration pneumonia presenting with progressively worsening
   dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs. CHF.
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Multi-factorial.  Possible pulmonary
   infection leading to respiratory failure, but more relevant is likely
   worsening CHF and poor forward flow.  Continuing diuresis to optimize
   for extubation on [**2114-1-15**]. Patient is now -1300 cc for LOS, and BUN/Cr
   rising.  We will continue to treat for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.  Patient on
   MMV with minimal support but has low VT when weaned down to PSV to [**5-9**].
   NIF -5 2 days ago so central muscle weakness also a significant
   problem.  [**Name (NI) 1398**] 114.
   - Planned extubation today
   - scopolamine patch for secretions
   - Will continue ceftaz, today day [**10-14**]
   - diuresis
lasix gtt with metolazone [**Hospital1 7**] for goal -1000 cc today and
   reassess after PM lytes
   - nothing to tap on CT or U/S
   - Albuterol and ipratropium prn
   - Do not re-intubate
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Likley [**2-6**] volume shifts in the setting of massive
   diuresis.
   -Increased free water flushes with tube feeds
   .
   #. HAP: Has pseudomonas in sputum, on ceftazidime. Afebrile, no
   leukocytosis, and decreasing secretions.
   - cont ceftaz as above
   .
   #  Metabolic alkalosis- likely [**2-6**] diuresis, bicarb trending up in
   setting of diuresis. Patient will have greater chance of weaning off
   the vent in setting of acidosis (will need smaller tidal volumes to
   ventilate)
   - KCl supplementation prn
   - D/C diamox
   - will monitor Na
   .
   # Right Greater Saphenous vein thrombus: Does not extend into common
   femoral vein.  IVC filter not indicated or wanted by family.  Will not
   change warfarin in interim.
   .
   #  Cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology, likely ischemic and related to
   dysnychromy. TTE shows low EF and worsened MR from prior.  CHF is
   likely contributing to respiratory failure as above.  INR
   subtherapeutic for past 3 days.
   - increased warfarin to 7.5 mg daily
   - Follow INR and dose appropriately
   - diuresis as above
   - cont rate control and reduce afterload with metoprolol/captopril
   .
   #. CAD: Extensive, but stable.   Episode of chest pain this morning
   resolved with morphine.  Low suspicion for mycocardial ischemia.  Will
   repeat ECG, as pt  is now pain free.  Cardiac Enzymes negative
   - will continue ASA, home statin
   .
   #.  Depression/Anxiety- currently on fentanyl and midazolam
   - continue lexapro
   .  .
   #.  h/o pontine infarct: At baseline, patient able to nod yes and no
   and shake head in response to questions.
   - continue coumadin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to HCAP vs aspiration PNA vs CHF.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to worsening CHF and poor forward flow. Diuresis is being continued to optimize for extubation on [**2114-1-15**]. The patient's BUN/Cr is rising, and he will continue to be treated for HCAP/VAP pneumonia.

The patient's planned extubation is today, and a scopolamine patch has been applied for secretions. Ceftazidime will be continued, and lasix has been changed to 40mg to attempt to keep him on a consistent dose. The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to volume shifts in the setting of massive diuresis, and free water flushes with tube feeds are being increased.

The patient has HAP with pseudomonas in sputum and is currently on ceftazidime. Metabolic alkalosis is suspected to be related to diuresis, and KCl supplementation will be given as needed. Diamox has been discontinued.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pontine CVA, CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with progressively worsening dyspnea over 2.5 weeks and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to HCAP versus aspiration PNA versus CHF.

The patient has been extubated without issue and is currently on a shovel mask. He experienced an episode of air hunger likely due to anxiety. He is on a scopolamine patch for secretions and has been discharged from ceftazidime. His lasix dosage has been increased to 100 qAM and 80 mg qPM. The target blood pressure is to be maintained today, and he is given albuterol and ipratropium as needed. It is noted that he should not be re-intubated.

The patient also has hypernatremia, which is likely due to volume shifts in the setting of massive diuresis. To address this, free water flushes with tube feeds are recommended every 4 hours.

Additionally, the patient has had pseudomonas in his sputum and was on ceftazidime. He has completed his course of antibiotics for HAP.

The patient also presents with metabolic alkalosis, likely due to diuresis. This has improved since extubation and less aggressive diuresis. KCl supplementation is recommended as needed.

   ANXIETY
   CHF - acute on chronic systolic
   Successfully weaned from ventilator.  He was somewhat SOB overnight -
   got fentanyl with some relief. Does not wish for reintubation. Will
   incr lasix sl based on an decrease in his BUN and creat overnight.  Na
   up so we are incr free water slightly.
   Plan is to return to his NH.  Will discuss with him and his wife if he
   would wish to be hospitalized again - he is very aware of his poor
   prognosis with an EF of 20% and severe MR.
