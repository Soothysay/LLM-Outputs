   and warfarin. Likely AF RVR [**1-21**] dehydration/sepsis physiology and
   fever.
   - Now on home diltiazem and metoprolol doses
   - Consider TEE to rule out vegetations and consider cardioversion given
   pt. not consistently in AF and tolerates poorly.
   - Suppress fever w/ standing tylenol as appears to be driving AF/RVR.
   - Will start amiodarone loading this morning and peel back diltiazem

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and previously admitted with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR). He presented with fatigue and fever, and was found to be in AF/RVR. He is currently in the ICU and receiving various medications including diltiazem, metoprolol, warfarin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR): The patient's current condition is AF/RVR, which can lead to poor cardiac output, hypotension, and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient has been febrile and has a history of cough and possible pneumonia (PNA). He is receiving antibiotics, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has elevated baseline creatinine levels and is at risk for further kidney injury due to dehydration, sepsis, and possibly contrast exposure during cardiac procedures.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CABG and may have ongoing ischemia or plaque rupture, leading to troponin leak and potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall, 118.5 kg male with an admission weight of 119.7 kg. He has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with variable blood pressure ranging from the 80s to 150s, heart rate in the 150s, and a temperature spike around 8:30 pm. He was given Tylenol and his PO metoprolol dose early. An echocardiogram (TTE) showed no significant abnormalities. The patient has received various medications including levofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, heparin sodium, diltiazem, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, ranging from the 80s to 150s. This could indicate poor perfusion and potential organ damage if not addressed promptly.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has been diagnosed with AF, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure if left untreated.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is no specific information provided regarding the nature or extent of impaired skin integrity, but it is important to monitor for signs of pressure ulcers or infections.

4. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient experienced"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, and previous admissions for AFib with RVR. The patient presented with fatigue, fever, and was found to be in AFib with RVR. He has been taking his prescribed metoprolol, diltiazem, and warfarin doses. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F, blood pressure of 92/48 mmHg, heart rate of 117 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 6L NC. The patient's general appearance is appropriate, with no signs of pallor or cyanosis. Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, bilateral pitting edema with stasis ulcer on the right shin, and surrounding erythema. Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, along with low albumin, calcium, and magnesium levels. The patient's INR is also elevated at 2.1.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is currently in AFib with RVR and is hemodynamically stable. The possible causes for the AFib with RVR include dehydration, sepsis physiology, and fever. The patient's fever may be due to pneumonia, medication side effects, or an unknown source. He is currently on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and previously admitted with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR). He presented with fatigue and fever, and was found to have AF/RVR. He is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient is taking prescribed metoprolol, diltiazem, and warfarin. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has been febrile despite antibiotic treatment, suggesting a possible ongoing infection. There is a concern for pneumonia, as indicated by cough and potential lung infection. Sputum culture and influenza testing should be done to identify the source of infection. Droplet precautions should be continued.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CABG) and is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. There is a concern for possible myocardial infarction or plaque rupture. Troponin levels are elevated, and it is important to continue metoprolol therapy.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has demonstrated signs of fluid overload, including bilateral lower extremity edema and crackles in the lung bases. This may be due to dehydration and poor oral intake. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and prior admission for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR). The patient presented with fatigue, fever, and was found to be in AF w/ RVR. He is currently hemodynamically stable and has been admitted with this condition before. The patient has been taking his prescribed metoprolol dose as well as diltiazem and warfarin.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Rhythm: The patient is in AF w/ RVR and is hemodynamically stable. Consideration for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out vegetations and consider cardioversion given the patient's intolerance to being consistently in AF. Suppress fever with standing Tylenol as it appears to be driving AF/RVR. Start amiodarone loading this morning and peel back diltiazem and metoprolol if pressures won't tolerate.

2. Fever: The patient has a cough at baseline, possibly lingular pneumonia (PNA). He is on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) treatment, but no overt PNA is seen on chest X-ray. The patient is still febrile despite"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), who presented with fatigue and fever. He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR) and admitted to the ICU. The patient has been taking his prescribed medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, and warfarin. He is suspected to have AFib w/ RVR due to likely dehydration/sepsis physiology and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm: The patient's AFib w/ RVR is currently hemodynamically stable, but there is a possibility of developing more severe symptoms or complications if not properly managed. The plan is to wean off the diltiazem drip, restart home PO metoprolol, consider transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) cardioversion, and suppress fever with Tylenol.
2. Fever: The patient has an ongoing fever, which could be due to pneumonia or another infection. It is important to continue suppressing the fever and investigate the cause further. The patient has already been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and the plan is to switch to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin as per the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, and previous admissions for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient presented with fatigue and was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is currently stable on hemodynamic monitoring. The patient has been prescribed metoprolol, diltiazem, and warfarin for his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dehydration: The patient has received aggressive fluid resuscitation, indicating possible dehydration. It is important to monitor fluid balance and maintain adequate hydration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated heart rate, and low blood pressure may suggest sepsis, especially considering his recent antibiotics for presumed CAP. Monitoring vital signs, maintaining infection control measures, and obtaining cultures are crucial.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has a history of single-vessel CABG and presents with troponin leak and elevated cardiac enzymes. Close monitoring of cardiac status and ongoing assessment for potential myocardial infarction are necessary.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there are concerns about acute kidney injury due to dehydration, sepsis, or contrast exposure. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication doses accordingly are important.
5. Respiratory infection: The patient has symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection, including cough and possible pneumonia"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to acute cholangitis and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 164 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/43-163/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has received various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, pantoprazole, diltiazem, warfarin, furosemide, lorazepam, and others. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium, decreased sodium, and elevated glucose levels. Other lab values including creatinine, total carbon dioxide, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, lactic acid, PT/INR, and differential count are within normal limits or do not show significant changes.

The patient's fluid balance shows a deficit of 706 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving IV fluids, and the total input exceeds the total output, indicating ongoing fluid resuscitation.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock secondary to acute cholangitis. There is a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis progression.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory infections.

3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, both of which increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular events.

4. Renal complications: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and the elevated creatinine levels indicate possible worsening renal function. Fluid management and medication dosing need to be adjusted carefully to avoid further renal impairment.

5. Metabolic complications: The patient has hyperglycemia, which may require insulin therapy to manage blood glucose levels effectively.

6. Bleeding complications: The patient is taking warfarin, an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding. Monitoring of coagulation parameters and careful management of any invasive procedures are necessary.

7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a deficit, and there are imbalances in potassium and sodium levels. Close monitoring of fluid status and electrolyte levels is required to prevent further imbalances.

These are some potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. However, it is important to note that the patient's condition may change over time, and additional complications may emerge."

   potential cardioversion and potential for sinus bradycardia.  Down to
   20mg of dilt today (30mg yesterday).
   .
   #Fever: Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA. On vanc/zosyn for HAP
   treatment, but no overt pna on cxr.  Also, pt still febrile despite
   these abx.  Other sources for fever include RLE ulcer (less likely, as
   pt. states that this has been stable) or drug fever.
   -continue vanc and zosyn

   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain so doubt
   [**1-21**] plaque rupture.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  BLE edema and crackles in lung bases, though CXR does not show
   significant pulmonary edema. Likely dehydrated given ARF, poor PO
   intake and diarrhea/sepsis physiology.
   - hold bumetanide
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 132 ([**Age over 90 **] yesterday)

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and currently admitted with fatigue, fever, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR). The patient's vital signs are unstable, with elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, and low sodium levels. The patient has been experiencing symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea, which may indicate pneumonia, sepsis, or dehydration. The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and poorly controlled diabetes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. The presence of AF/RVR may further complicate the patient's condition by increasing the heart rate and potentially leading to hemodynamic instability.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, along with the CT torso findings suggestive of pneumonia, indicate a potential respiratory infection. This increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's history of CKD and elevated creatinine levels suggest compromised renal function. The presence of fever, dehydration, and potential sepsis could worsen renal function and lead to acute kidney injury (AKI).

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever found to be in Afib with
   RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: AF w/ RVR currently HD stable. Has been admitted w/ this
   before. Has been taking his prescribed metoprolol dose as well as dilt
   and warfarin. Likely AF RVR [**1-21**] dehydration/sepsis physiology and
   fever.
   - Now on home diltiazem and metoprolol doses
   - Plan for TEE today to rule out vegetations and consider cardioversion
   given pt. not consistently in AF and tolerates poorly.
   - Suppress fever w/ standing tylenol as appears to be driving AF/RVR.
   - Started on amiodarone yesterday.  Titrate down diltiazem given
   potential cardioversion and potential for sinus bradycardia.  Down to
   20mg of dilt today (30mg yesterday).
   .
   #Fever: Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA. On vanc/zosyn for HAP
   treatment, but no overt pna on cxr.  Also, pt still febrile despite
   these abx.  Other sources for fever include RLE ulcer (less likely, as
   pt. states that this has been stable) or drug fever.
   -continue vanc and zosyn
   - CT torso-> RLL air bronchogram suggestive of pneumonia, small right
   pleural effusion, reactive LAD in mediastinum, large calcified cystic
   mass in spleen likely old, large edematous kidneys bilaterally with
   stranding (cannot rule out pyelo because no IV contrast)
   - sputum culture
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urin culture is pending
   -loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**]- pending
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain so doubt
   [**1-21**] plaque rupture.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  BLE edema and crackles in lung bases, though CXR does not show
   significant pulmonary edema. Likely dehydrated given ARF, poor PO
   intake and diarrhea/sepsis physiology.
   - hold bumetanide
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 132 ([**Age over 90 **] yesterday)
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Continue home glargine 44U QAM
   - ISS
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic in setting of poor PO intake, status
   post 4L aggressive fluid resuscitation in ED.
   -trend Na for now
   -if no improvement of Na in am, obtain urine lytes
   .
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2, Patient endorsed poor PO intake and is likely
   pre-renal [**1-21**] hypovolemia in setting of recent illness. S/p 4L IVF in
   ED.
   -encourage PO intake
   -IVF as needed
   .
   # Anemia: baseline hct~27, at baseline today with signs/symptoms of
   bleeding.
   .
   # Anticoagulation
   -on coumadin 4mg daily.  INR up to 3.2 this AM (2.4 yesterday).
   -will hold coumadin today
   .
   #FEN: follow and replete lytes, PO diabetic diet

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and is currently admitted for fatigue and fever. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR) and has been experiencing poor tolerance of the condition.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 164 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/43-108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral pitting edema with stasis ulcer on the right shin and surrounding erythema. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin levels, elevated creatinine, and hyponatremia.

The patient's assessment includes:
1. AF/RVR currently hemodynamically stable.
2. Likely AF/RVR [**1-21**] dehydration/sepsis physiology and fever.
3. Plan for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) today to rule out vegetations and consider cardioversion given the patient not consistently in AF and tolerates poorly.
4. Suppress fever with standing tylenol as appears to be driving AF/RVR.
5. Started on amiodarone yesterday. Titrate"

   Assessment and Plan
   ICU Care
","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications. They have a history of atrial fibrillation and are on Coumadin (Warfarin). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius (101.2 degrees Fahrenheit), blood pressure ranging from 114/43 mmHg to 144/108 mmHg, heart rate of 164 bpm, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has a significant weight gain since admission, going from 119.7 kg to 123.3 kg. Their fluid balance shows a total input of 4,520 mL and output of 1,520 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,000 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, decreased breath sounds at the bases, bilateral pitting edema with stasis ulcer on the right shin and surrounding erythema, and cool feet. The patient's labs indicate elevated potassium levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's significant weight gain, negative fluid balance, and edema indicate potential fluid overload.
3. Hypotension: The patient's"

   before. Has been taking his prescribed metoprolol dose as well as dilt
   and warfarin. Likely AF RVR [**1-21**] dehydration/sepsis physiology and
   fever.
   - Now on home diltiazem and metoprolol doses
   - Plan for TEE today to rule out vegetations and consider cardioversion
   given pt. not consistently in AF and tolerates poorly.
   - Suppress fever w/ standing tylenol as appears to be driving AF/RVR.
   - Started on amiodarone yesterday.  Titrate down diltiazem given
   potential cardioversion and potential for sinus bradycardia.  Down to
   20mg of dilt today (30mg yesterday).

   #Fever: Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA. On vanc/zosyn for HAP
   treatment, but no overt pna on cxr.  Also, pt still febrile despite

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and currently admitted with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR). The patient has been on home diltiazem and metoprolol doses. The plan for today is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out vegetations and consider cardioversion given that the patient tolerates poorly in AF/RVR. The patient's fever is being suppressed with standing Tylenol, and he has been started on amiodarone. Diltiazem dosage has been titrated down due to potential cardioversion and the risk of sinus bradycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe arrhythmia or heart failure.
2. Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and risk factors such as atrial fibrillation.
3. Worsening of renal function due to dehydration, sepsis physiology, or hypotension.
4. Progression of pneumonia or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Clostridium difficile infection due to antibiotic use.
6. Hepatic dysfunction due to sepsis or underlying liver disease.
7. Hypotension"

   # RHYTHM: AF w/ RVR currently HD stable. Has been admitted w/ this
   before. Has been taking his prescribed metoprolol dose as well as dilt
   and warfarin. Likely AF RVR [**1-21**] dehydration/sepsis physiology and
   fever.
   - Now on home diltiazem and metoprolol doses
   - Plan for TEE today to rule out vegetations and consider cardioversion
   given pt. not consistently in AF and tolerates poorly.
   - Suppress fever w/ standing tylenol as appears to be driving AF/RVR.
   - Started on amiodarone yesterday.  Titrate down diltiazem given
   potential cardioversion and potential for sinus bradycardia.  Down to
   20mg of dilt today (30mg yesterday).

   #Fever: Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA. On vanc/zosyn for HAP
   treatment, but no overt pna on cxr.  Also, pt still febrile despite
   these abx.  Other sources for fever include RLE ulcer (less likely, as
   pt. states that this has been stable) or drug fever.

   significant pulmonary edema. Likely dehydrated given ARF, poor PO
   intake and diarrhea/sepsis physiology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and fatigue. He presented with fever and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with successful cardioversion. He is currently in sinus rhythm but still has elevated heart rate. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but he has bilateral lower limb edema with stasis ulcers and surrounding erythema. There are concerns about a possible liver abscess and right lower lobe cavitary lesion. The patient is on respiratory isolation, and sputum induction has been performed for acid-fast bacilli smear, gram stain, cultures, and fungal cultures. Levofloxacin should be discontinued due to the risk of developing resistant tuberculosis. Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam can be continued. The patient's other lab results show elevated troponin, elevated creatinine, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Isolation: The patient is on respiratory isolation due to possible tuberculosis (TB). This indicates the need for precautions to prevent the spread of infection.
2. Liver Abscess: The patient may have a liver abscess, which can cause fever, pain, and potentially lead to sepsis if not treated appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema and hypotension. The patient's condition has been unstable with recurrent episodes of fever, rigors, difficulty breathing, and hypoxia. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). His vital signs are currently stable, but he remains on non-rebreather oxygen and requires ongoing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP): The patient's symptoms of fever, rigors, and difficulty breathing suggest a possible bacterial infection in the lungs.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's initial presentation of acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion to vital organs and requires close monitoring and management.
4. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment suggests an underlying infection or inflammatory condition that needs further investigation.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of cavitary lesions on the CT scan raises concerns about potential skin breakdown or abscess formation.
6. Atrial fibrillation"

   [**2154-7-24**]- Discontinued diltiazem today.  In sinus rhythm s/p
   cardioversion, still elevated but less than 100.
   Spoke to radiology regarding possible abscess vs resolving hematoma in
   liver.  Recommended calling on [**7-25**] AM to discuss U/S guided liver
   biopsy.
   Infectious disease: Given the cavitary lesion on CT they recommend
   ruling out TB and placing pt in respiratory isolation.  Pt to undergo
   sputum induction- send for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, fungal
   cultures.  Levofloxacin should be discontinued since pt may develop
   resistant TB however, the Vanc and Zosyn can be continued. ID will
   discuss questionable hematoma vs abcess with the radiology attending in
   the AM.
   NPO after midnight for possible IR procedure tomorrow

   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever found to be in Afib with
   RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: TEE with cardioversion performed yesterday.  Now in sinus
   rhythm with heart rate hovering around 100 (down from 150s yesterday).
   Patient hemodynamically stable.  Diltiazem discontinued on [**7-24**]
   - On metoprolol
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully
   - Consider stopping amiodarone today if heart rate lowers.
   .
   #Fever:  Radiology noted possible liver absess on CT yesterday as well
   as RLL cavitory lesion.  Want to rule out TB.  Will discuss possible
   U/S guided needle biopsy with IR today.  Cough at baseline, ? lingular
   PNA.  On vanc/zosyn for HAP treatment.  Pt still febrile despite these
   abx.  Other sources for fever include RLE ulcer (less likely, as pt.
   states that this has been stable) or drug fever.
   -continue vanc and zosyn
   - CT torso-> RLL air bronchogram suggestive of pneumonia, small right
   pleural effusion, reactive LAD in mediastinum, large calcified cystic
   mass in spleen likely old, large edematous kidneys bilaterally with
   stranding (cannot rule out pyelo because no IV contrast)
   - sputum culture
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urin culture is pending
   -loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**]- pending
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain so doubt
   [**1-21**] plaque rupture.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  BLE edema and crackles in lung bases, though CXR does not show
   significant pulmonary edema. Likely dehydrated given ARF, poor PO
   intake and diarrhea/sepsis physiology.
   - hold bumetanide
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 132 ([**Age over 90 **] yesterday)
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Continue home glargine 44U QAM
   - ISS
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic in setting of poor PO intake, status
   post 4L aggressive fluid resuscitation in ED.
   -trend Na for now
   -if no improvement of Na in am, obtain urine lytes
   .
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2, Patient endorsed poor PO intake and is likely
   pre-renal [**1-21**] hypovolemia in setting of recent illness. S/p 4L IVF in

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, presenting with fatigue, fever, and found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with cardioversion, which was successful in converting the patient to sinus rhythm.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 114/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The patient is currently on non-rebreather oxygen.

The patient has a history of fever, and radiology noted possible liver abscess on CT scan. There is also a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe of the lung, which raises suspicion for tuberculosis. The infectious disease service recommends ruling out TB and placing the patient in respiratory isolation. The patient will undergo sputum induction and send for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, gram stain, cultures, and fungal cultures. Levofloxacin should be discontinued since the patient may develop resistant TB; however, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam can be continued.

The patient is NPO after midnight for a possible interventional radiology (IR) procedure tomorrow. The patient had rigors without fever"

   rhythm with heart rate hovering around 100 (down from 150s yesterday).
   Patient hemodynamically stable.  Diltiazem discontinued on [**7-24**]
   - reduce amiodarone to 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - On metoprolol and amiodarone- continue
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully
   .
   #Fever:  Radiology noted possible liver absess on CT yesterday as well
   as RLL cavitory lesion.  ID consulted.  Recommended
   ruling out TB and placing pt on respiratory isolation.  Pt to undergo
   sputum induction- send for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, fungal
   cultures.  Levofloxacin should be discontinued since pt may develop
   resistant TB however, the Vanc and Zosyn can be continued.
   ID will discuss possible U/S guided needle biopsy with IR today.  Cough
   at baseline, ? lingular PNA.  On vanc/zosyn for HAP treatment.  Pt
   still febrile despite these abx.  Other sources for fever include RLE
   ulcer (less likely, as pt. states that this has been stable), drug
   fever, liver abscess, lung lesion.
   -Continue vanc and zosyn
   - sputum culture induced for AFB last night.  Results this AM show
   contamination.  Will repeat and then induce two more sputums for AFB to
   rule out TB
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urine culture is pending
   - loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**]- negative
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain so doubt
   [**1-21**] plaque rupture.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  CXR showed significant pulmonary edema overnight.  Was given
   60mg IV lasix and then 40mg IV lasix after checking pressures.  BLE
   edema and crackles in lung bases.  Symptomatically improved since
   events from overnight.
   - lasix as needed for lung edema diuresis
   - hold bumetanide
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 123 (132 yesterday)
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Continue home glargine 44U QAM

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and fatigue. He presented with fever and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with successful cardioversion, converting him into sinus rhythm. His heart rate decreased from 150s to around 100. The patient is hemodynamically stable, but his liver function tests show elevated levels of AST and ALT. The patient also has a history of right lower lobe (RLL) cavitary lesion seen on CT scan, which raises concern for a possible lung abscess or tuberculosis (TB). He is currently on respiratory isolation and will undergo sputum induction for AFB smear, gram stain, and cultures. A US-guided needle biopsy is recommended to further evaluate the liver lesion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of PAF and recent conversion to sinus rhythm with cardioversion puts him at risk for developing other cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's CXR showed significant pulmonary edema overnight, which could be due to fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring and diuresis with lasix are required to manage this complication.
3. Liver abscess:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and presents with fatigue and fever. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with successful cardioversion. The patient is now in sinus rhythm but still has an elevated heart rate around 100 bpm.

2. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever despite being on appropriate antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The source of the fever remains elusive, and possible causes include a liver abscess, lung lesion, or drug fever. Further investigations are needed to identify the source.

3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray showed significant pulmonary edema overnight. The patient received IV lasix and showed symptomatic improvement. Lasix will be given as needed for lung edema diuresis. Bumetanide should be held, and the patient's fluid status should be closely monitored.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been stable at 123K/uL (132 yesterday). If the platelet count worsens, tick-borne infections should"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), who presented with fatigue and fever. He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with cardioversion, which was successful in converting him back to sinus rhythm. However, he remains hemodynamically unstable.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Liver Abscess: The radiology notes a possible liver abscess on the CT scan. Infectious disease (ID) consultation recommended ruling out tuberculosis (TB) and placing the patient on respiratory isolation. The ID also suggested considering an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Lung Infection: The patient has a cough at baseline, and there is suspicion of a possible pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (PNA) in the lingular region. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) treatment. Despite these antibiotics, the patient remains febrile, indicating that the source of infection may still be present.

3. Tuberculosis (TB): Due to the suspicion of TB, sputum cultures were induced for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) but were"

   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever found to be in Afib with
   RVR, now s/p cardioversion, and in NSR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: TEE with cardioversion performed [**7-24**].  Now in sinus rhythm
   with heart rate in the high 90s (down from 150s before cardioversion).
   Patient hemodynamically stable.  Diltiazem discontinued on [**7-24**].
   - Continue amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - On metoprolol and amiodarone
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully
   #Fever:  Radiology noted possible liver hematoma vs. abscess on CT
   yesterday as well as RLL cavitory lesion.  ID consulted.  Recommended
   ruling out TB and placing pt on respiratory isolation.  Pt to undergo
   sputum induction - send for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, fungal
   cultures.  Levofloxacin should be discontinued since pt may develop
   resistant TB however, the Vanc and Zosyn can be continued.
   - ID will discuss possible U/S guided needle biopsy with IR today.
   Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA.  On vanc/zosyn for HAP treatment.
   Pt still febrile despite these abx.  Other sources and DDX for fever
   includes RLE ulcer (less likely, as pt. states that this has been
   stable and negative x-ray for osteo), drug fever, liver abscess, lung
   lesion.
   - pulm consult for bronch given new left sided haze/infiltrate
   -Continue vanc and zosyn
   - sputum culture induced for AFB last night.  Results c/w
   contamination.  Will repeat and then induce one more sputum for AFB to
   rule out TB this AM
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urine culture is pending
   - loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**] - negative
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  CXR showed significant pulmonary edema yesterday.  Was given
   100mg IV lasix twice yesterday after checking pressures.  BLE edema and
   crackles in lung.  Symptomatically improved since events from overnight
   but still on non-rebreather.
   - Consider Lasix/metolazone for better lung edema diuresis
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 123 (132 yesterday)
   - ordered for peripheral smear; will have hematology review it for plt
   and possible immature wbc forms
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Have increased home glargine to 54U QAM given the D5 he is getting
   with his Abx
   - ISS
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic in setting of poor PO intake, status
   post 4L aggressive fluid resuscitation in ED.
   -trend Na for now
   -if no improvement of Na in am, obtain urine lytes
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2, Patient endorsed poor PO intake and is likely
   pre-renal [**1-21**] hypovolemia in setting of recent illness. S/p 4L IVF in
   ED.
   -encourage PO intake
   -IVF as needed
   # Anemia: baseline hct~27, at baseline today with no signs/symptoms of
   bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, presenting with fatigue, fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient's current medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, as indicated by crackles in the lungs, low oxygen saturation, and a chest X-ray showing significant pulmonary edema. The patient was given 100mg IV lasix twice yesterday after checking pressures and showed improvement in symptoms.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with antibiotics such as Vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient's cough, fever, and abnormal chest X-ray findings suggest an ongoing infection.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite being on antibiotics, the patient continues to have a fever, which needs further investigation.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has bilateral pitting edema with stasis ulcer on the right shin and surrounding erythema. This indicates poor skin integrity and may be a sign of chronic venous insufficiency.

5. Hypotension: The patient has been observed with low blood pressure readings, indicating possible hypotension.

6. Thrombocytopenia:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, presenting with fatigue, fever, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/RVR). The patient was cardioverted successfully and is now in normal sinus rhythm. He has pulmonary edema and is being treated with lasix. There are also concerns about a possible liver abscess and right lower lobe cavitary lesion. The patient is on respiratory isolation and will undergo sputum induction for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, and fungal cultures. Other sources of fever include a leg ulcer, drug fever, lung lesion, and potential renal infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has significant pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The presence of fever, possible liver abscess, and cavitary lung lesion suggests a potential infection. If untreated, it can progress to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and there is a possibility of recurrent arrhythmias. This can lead to hemodynamic instability and complications like stroke.
4. Leg Ulcer: The presence of a leg ulcer with surrounding erythema raises concerns for a potential deep vein thrombosis or cellulitis. If not"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with fatigue and fever, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with successful cardioversion, converting him to sinus rhythm with a heart rate around 100 beats per minute. He is hemodynamically stable.

The patient has been experiencing fever, and further investigation revealed possible liver abscess and right lower lobe cavitary lesion on the CT scan. The infectious disease (ID) team recommended ruling out tuberculosis (TB) and placing the patient on respiratory isolation. Sputum induction and cultures have been sent for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, gram stain, and fungal cultures. Levofloxacin should be discontinued as it may lead to resistant TB, but vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam can be continued. The ID team also discussed the possibility of ultrasound-guided needle biopsy with interventional radiology (IR) today.

The patient's pain control has been managed with meperidine and morphine sulfate. He is currently receiving intravenous (IV) lasix for pulmonary edema and diuresis. His diabetes has been poorly controlled, with an A1c level of 10.5%, resulting in nephropathy and neuropathy. The patient's sodium level is also low, likely due to poor oral intake and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

The patient's thrombocytopenia has been stable at 123,000/mm3. His baseline creatinine level is elevated at 3.4 mg/dL, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's anemia is at baseline with a hemoglobin concentration of 27%. He is currently on Coumadin, but his INR is elevated at 4.7, so he will be held off from it today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has shown signs of pulmonary edema, which is a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs, causing breathing difficulties.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is being treated with appropriate antibiotics.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, indicating hypotension.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, a heart rhythm disorder characterized by rapid and irregular heartbeats.
5. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment suggests a possible underlying infection or condition.
6. Liver Abscess: The patient's CT scan showed a possible liver abscess, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.
7. Lung Lesion: The patient has a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe of his lungs, which requires further investigation.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low,"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, presenting with fatigue, fever, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient underwent cardioversion and is now in normal sinus rhythm. He has been hemodynamically stable.

The patient's fever persists despite antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Radiology shows possible liver hematoma or abscess and a right lower lobe cavitary lesion. The infectious disease (ID) team consulted and recommended ruling out tuberculosis (TB) and placing the patient on respiratory isolation. Sputum induction for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, and fungal cultures was performed. Levofloxacin was discontinued due to the risk of developing resistant TB, while vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam can be continued. A needle biopsy guided by ultrasound (U/S) is planned for further evaluation.

The patient also has pulmonary edema, which improved after receiving IV lasix. The chest X-ray showed significant pulmonary edema, and the echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction (EF) with normal valvular function. Metolazone may be considered for better lung edema diuresis.

Other findings include thrombocytopenia, poorly controlled diabetes, hyponatremia, acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia"

   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever found to be in Afib with
   RVR, now s/p cardioversion, and in NSR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: TEE with cardioversion performed [**7-24**].  Now in sinus rhythm
   with heart rate in the high 90s (down from 150s before cardioversion).
   Patient hemodynamically stable.  Diltiazem discontinued on [**7-24**].
   - Continue amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - On metoprolol and amiodarone
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully
   #Fever:  Radiology noted possible liver hematoma vs. abscess on CT
   yesterday as well as RLL cavitory lesion.  ID consulted.  Recommended
   ruling out TB and placing pt on respiratory isolation.  Pt to undergo
   sputum induction - send for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, fungal
   cultures.  Levofloxacin should be discontinued since pt may develop
   resistant TB however, the Vanc and Zosyn can be continued.
   - ID will discuss possible U/S guided needle biopsy with IR today.
   Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA.  On vanc/zosyn for HAP treatment.
   Pt still febrile despite these abx.  Other sources and DDX for fever
   includes RLE ulcer (less likely, as pt. states that this has been
   stable and negative x-ray for osteo), drug fever, liver abscess, lung
   lesion.
   - pulm consult for bronch given new left sided haze/infiltrate
   -Continue vanc and zosyn
   - sputum culture induced for AFB last night.  Results c/w
   contamination.  Will repeat and then induce one more sputum for AFB to
   rule out TB this AM
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urine culture is pending
   - loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**] - negative
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  CXR showed significant pulmonary edema yesterday.  Was given
   100mg IV lasix twice yesterday after checking pressures.  BLE edema and
   crackles in lung.  Symptomatically improved since events from overnight
   but still on non-rebreather.
   - Consider Lasix/metolazone for better lung edema diuresis
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 123 (132 yesterday)
   - ordered for peripheral smear; will have hematology review it for plt
   and possible immature wbc forms
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Have increased home glargine to 54U QAM given the D5 he is getting
   with his Abx
   - ISS
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic in setting of poor PO intake, status
   post 4L aggressive fluid resuscitation in ED.
   -trend Na for now
   -if no improvement of Na in am, obtain urine lytes
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2, Patient endorsed poor PO intake and is likely
   pre-renal [**1-21**] hypovolemia in setting of recent illness. S/p 4L IVF in

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and PAF. He presented with fatigue, fever, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFR). The patient underwent cardioversion and is now in sinus rhythm. He is hemodynamically stable but has been experiencing fever despite being on antibiotics. Radiology findings suggest a possible liver hematoma vs. abscess and a right lower lobe cavitary lesion. The patient has been placed on respiratory isolation and is undergoing sputum induction for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, and fungal cultures. The ID consulted recommends ruling out TB and discussing possible U/S guided needle biopsy with IR. The patient's cough is at baseline, and he may have a pulmonary nodular infiltrate. He is still febrile, and other potential sources of fever include a stasis ulcer on his right shin, drug fever, liver abscess, and lung lesion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tuberculosis (TB): The patient has been placed on respiratory isolation and recommended tests are being conducted to rule out TB. If TB is confirmed, it may require prolonged treatment with specific medications and isolation precautions.
2. Liver abscess: The presence of a possible liver hematoma vs. abscess needs further evaluation. If an abscess is confirmed, it may require drainage and antibiotic therapy.
3. Lung infection: The cavitary"

   -Insulin sliding scale changed yesterday, glucose improved this AM to
   the high 100s, continue to monitor.
   -Pulmonary consulted and will not proceed with bronch unless the
   patient decompensates.  They feel that the patient is doing better and
   requiring less oxygen.  They would not expect tremendous improvement
   after just 4 days of vanc/zosyn and said that the patient will require
   at least 8 days.  They will continue to follow.
   -Respiratory therapy consulted for chest PT and bronchial hygiene
   -Tried to get a CT scan, but patient could not tolerate because he
   couldn't lie flat without respiratory decompensation
   -Given 5mg of metolazone 30 minutes before 120mg IV Lasix and put out
   1L in first 3 hours

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, presenting with fatigue, fever, found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, now successfully cardioverted and in sinus rhythm. The patient's hemodynamic stability is maintained. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient is febrile and has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). There is a possibility of resistant TB, and the ID consultation recommends ruling out TB and placing the patient on respiratory isolation. The patient is also at risk for developing drug-resistant TB due to previous antibiotic use.

2. Liver Abscess: Radiology noted possible liver hematoma vs. abscess on CT yesterday. The ID consultation recommended ruling out TB and considering an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy with interventional radiology (IR) today.

3. Lung Lesion: The patient has a right lower lobe cavity lesion. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of single-vessel CABG. Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10, and the patient denies chest pain.

   [**2154-7-26**] - voided this AM, but was not able to make it to restroom, in
   order to record total output.  PICC line placed today.
   -Insulin sliding scale changed yesterday, glucose improved this AM to
   the high 100s, continue to monitor.
   -Pulmonary consulted and will not proceed with bronch unless the
   patient decompensates.  They feel that the patient is doing better and
   requiring less oxygen.  They would not expect tremendous improvement
   after just 4 days of vanc/zosyn and said that the patient will require
   at least 8 days.  They will continue to follow.
   -Respiratory therapy consulted for chest PT and bronchial hygiene
   -Tried to get a CT scan, but patient could not tolerate because he
   couldn't lie flat without respiratory decompensation
   -Given 5mg of metolazone 30 minutes before 120mg IV Lasix and put out
   1L in first 3 hours
   -ID recommended adding renally dosed Cipro IV to his current antibiotic

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, presenting with fatigue, fever, and found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He underwent cardioversion and is now in sinus rhythm. The patient is currently being treated in the ICU for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which is not improving despite antibiotic therapy. The patient also has a history of poorly controlled diabetes, coronary artery disease, anemia, and renal insufficiency.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 120/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a non-rebreather mask.

Physical examination findings include labored respirations, use of accessory muscles, crackles/rhonchi throughout the left lung, occasional expiratory wheezing, and bilateral 2+ pitting edema with stasis ulcer on the right shin. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Urine output has been low at 1L in the past 24 hours. Blood cultures have been negative, but sputum cultures are pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever found to be in Afib with
   RVR, now s/p cardioversion, and in NSR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: TEE with cardioversion performed [**7-24**].  Now in sinus rhythm
   with heart rate in the high 90s (down from 150s before cardioversion).
   Patient hemodynamically stable.  Diltiazem discontinued on [**7-24**].
   - Continue amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - On metoprolol and amiodarone
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully
   #Fever:  Radiology noted possible liver hematoma vs. abscess on CT
   yesterday as well as RLL cavitory lesion.  ID consulted.  Recommended
   ruling out TB and placing pt on respiratory isolation.  Pt to undergo
   sputum induction - send for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, fungal
   cultures.  Levofloxacin should be discontinued since pt may develop
   resistant TB however, the Vanc and Zosyn can be continued.  Cipro IV
   400mg daily started 8/7 per ID recs to further broaden coverage.
   - ID will discuss possible U/S guided needle biopsy with IR today.
   Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA.  On cipro day 1 and vanc/zosyn day 5
   today for HAP treatment.  Pt still febrile despite these abx and round
   the clock Tylenol.  Other sources and DDX for fever includes RLE ulcer
   (less likely, as pt. states that this has been stable and negative
   x-ray for osteo), drug fever, liver abscess, lung lesion.
   - pulm consult for bronch given new left sided haze/infiltrate, but
   will consided doing the procedure only if the patient
s condition
   worsens
   -Continue vanc and zosyn, cipro
   - sputum culture induced for AFB last night.  Results c/w
   contamination.  Will repeat and then induce one more sputum for AFB to
   rule out TB this AM
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urine culture is pending
   - loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**] - negative
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  CXR showed significant pulmonary edema yesterday.  Was given
   100mg IV lasix twice yesterday after checking pressures.  BLE edema and
   crackles in lung.  Symptomatically improved since events from overnight
   but still on non-rebreather.
   - Consider Lasix/metolazone for better lung edema diuresis
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 123 (132 yesterday)
   - ordered for peripheral smear; will have hematology review it for plt
   and possible immature wbc forms
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Have increased home glargine to 54U QAM given the D5 he is getting
   with his Abx
   - ISS
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic in setting of poor PO intake, status
   post 4L aggressive fluid resuscitation in ED.
   -trend Na for now
   -if no improvement of Na in am, obtain urine lytes
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2, Patient endorsed poor PO intake and is likely
   pre-renal [**1-21**] hypovolemia in setting of recent illness. S/p 4L IVF in
   ED.
   -encourage PO intake
   -IVF as needed
   # Anemia: baseline hct~27, down to 22 this AM with no signs/symptoms of
   bleeding. Re-check Hct this afternoon.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, who presented with fatigue and fever. The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and underwent cardioversion, resulting in sinus rhythm. 

The patient's current condition includes fever, cough, bilateral lower extremity edema with stasis ulcers, and hypotension. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated glucose levels, hyponatremia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging reveals possible liver hematoma vs. abscess and right lower lobe cavitary lesion. 

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, zosyn, cipro), cardiac medications (metoprolol, amiodarone), diuretics (lasix, metolazone), and others. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever, cough, and signs of systemic infection. There is also a concern for resistant tuberculosis, liver abscess, and lung lesion. Appropriate cultures and further investigations are underway.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has significant pulmonary edema and is on non-rebreather oxygen. There is a concern for worsening respiratory status, especially given the presence of crackles in the lung"

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation (AFib).
- He presented with fatigue and was found to have AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient underwent cardioversion and is now in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with a heart rate in the high 90s.
- The patient has been experiencing fever and has a possible liver hematoma or abscess on computed tomography (CT) scan. He has been placed on respiratory isolation and is being treated with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient's cough is at baseline, and he has a lung cavity lesion. He is also being treated for possible tuberculosis (TB) with levofloxacin, which has been discontinued due to the risk of developing resistant TB.
- The patient's extremities show bilateral 2+ pitting edema with stasis ulcers on the right shin and surrounding erythema.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19000 cells/mL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated procalcitonin levels.

   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever found to be in Afib with
   RVR, now s/p cardioversion, and in NSR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: TEE with cardioversion performed [**7-24**].  Now in sinus rhythm
   with heart rate in the high 90s (down from 150s before cardioversion).
    Patient hemodynamically stable.  Diltiazem discontinued on [**7-24**].
   - Continue amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - On metoprolol and amiodarone
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully
   #Fever:  Radiology noted possible liver hematoma vs. abscess on CT
   yesterday as well as RLL cavitory lesion.  ID consulted.  Recommended
   ruling out TB and placing pt on respiratory isolation.  Pt to undergo
   sputum induction - send for AFB smear, gram stain, cultures, fungal
   cultures.  Levofloxacin should be discontinued since pt may develop
   resistant TB however, the Vanc and Zosyn can be continued.  Cipro IV
   400mg daily started 8/7 per ID recs to further broaden coverage.
   - ID will discuss possible U/S guided needle biopsy with IR today.
   Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA.  On cipro day 1 and vanc/zosyn day 5
   today for HAP treatment.  Pt still febrile despite these abx and round
   the clock Tylenol.  Other sources and DDX for fever includes RLE ulcer
   (less likely, as pt. states that this has been stable and negative
   x-ray for osteo), drug fever, liver abscess, lung lesion.
   - pulm consult for bronch given new left sided haze/infiltrate, but
   will consided doing the procedure only if the patient
s condition
   worsens
   -Continue vanc and zosyn, cipro
   - sputum culture induced for AFB last night.  Results c/w
   contamination.  Will repeat and then induce one more sputum for AFB to
   rule out TB this AM
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urine culture is pending
   - loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**] - negative
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  CXR showed significant pulmonary edema yesterday.  Was given
   100mg IV lasix twice yesterday after checking pressures.  BLE edema and
   crackles in lung.  Symptomatically improved since events from overnight
   but still on non-rebreather.
   - Consider Lasix/metolazone for better lung edema diuresis
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 123 (132 yesterday)
   - ordered for peripheral smear; will have hematology review it for plt
   and possible immature wbc forms
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Have increased home glargine to 54U QAM given the D5 he is getting
   with his Abx
   - ISS
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic in setting of poor PO intake, status
   post 4L aggressive fluid resuscitation in ED.
   -trend Na for now
   -if no improvement of Na in am, obtain urine lytes
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2, Patient endorsed poor PO intake and is likely
   pre-renal [**1-21**] hypovolemia in setting of recent illness. S/p 4L IVF in
   ED.
   -encourage PO intake
   -IVF as needed
   # Anemia: baseline hct~27, down to 22 this AM with no signs/symptoms of
   bleeding. Re-check Hct this afternoon.
   # Anticoagulation
   -was on coumadin 4mg daily, which was held for INR=4.7 prior to PICC
   placement
   -INR=1.3 this AM, will restart Coumadin

   osteomyelitis, TB.  TB precautions removed.  ID consulted.  On Vanc and
   Zosyn.  Cipro IV 400mg daily started 8/7 per ID recs to further broaden
   coverage.
   - Afebrile yesterday.  Still receiving scheduled Tylenol.  Will
   discontinue Tylenol today and monitor fever curve.
   - On vanc, zosyn (day 7) and cipro (day 3).
   - AFB sputum negative x 3.  TB precautions removed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is being treated for several medical conditions. 

The patient has a history of fever with a peak temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), which could indicate an infection. They are also experiencing hypotension, with a blood pressure reading of 113/50 mmHg, indicating low blood pressure. 

The patient's respiratory support includes high flow nasal oxygen, which suggests respiratory distress or difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided in the note, but the use of high flow oxygen indicates potential respiratory compromise.

Additionally, the patient is diagnosed with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and fever of unknown origin. These diagnoses will require specific medical interventions and monitoring.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated blood glucose levels. The coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and slightly elevated international normalized ratio (INR), suggesting possible coagulation abnormalities.

The patient's fluid balance shows an overall negative balance of -584 mL, indicating fluid loss. This could be related to increased insensible losses due to fever or ongoing fluid removal from treatments.

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, presenting with fatigue, fever of unknown origin, and found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). He was previously cardioverted but remains in AFib with RVR. The patient is currently receiving amiodarone, metoprolol, and diltiazem for rhythm control. His fever is likely due to pneumonia, and he is on vancomycin and Zosyn. He has been febrile for the past week, and his fever has not responded to Tylenol. The patient's chest x-ray shows some clearing of the left opacities since the two prior chest x-rays, but atelectasis of the right base persists. The patient is also experiencing pulmonary edema, pain control, bacterial pneumonia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and fever of unknown origin. Other comorbidities include anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes, hyponatremia, acute kidney injury, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) - The patient has been in AFib with RVR despite cardioversion, which can lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, and thromboembolism.
2. Pneum"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, presenting with fatigue, fever, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was found to have pneumonia, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient underwent cardioversion and is now in sinus rhythm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema as indicated by crackles/rhonchi throughout the left lung and occasional expiratory wheezing. This could be due to fluid overload or heart failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, which is evident from fever, productive cough, and abnormal chest X-ray findings.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to sepsis secondary to pneumonia or cardiac dysfunction.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has stasis ulcers on his right shin and surrounding erythema. This suggests compromised skin integrity, likely due to chronic venous insufficiency and possibly exacerbated by poor mobility.
5. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite multiple negative cultures and tests, the patient continues to have a persistent low-grade fever, suggesting an ongoing infectious or inflammatory process.
6. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of par"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). He presented with fatigue, fever of unknown origin, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient underwent cardioversion but remains in AFib again. He is currently hemodynamically stable and receiving amiodarone, metoprolol, and diltiazem for rate control.

The patient has several medical complications including pulmonary edema, pneumonia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and fever of unknown origin. He also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, poorly controlled diabetes, hyponatremia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and lower extremity edema/ulcers.

Plan:
1. Continue amiodarone at 400mg and metoprolol at home dose.
2. Consider repeat cardioversion or adding standing diltiazem.
3. Continue IV lasix and switch to PO lasix 120mg daily.
4. Check stool guaiac today to assess for lower GI bleeding.
5. Transfuse if H/H drops below 7.4/24.2.
6. Order peripheral smear and consult hematology for possible immature WBC forms.
7. Increase home glargine to"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm at 10AM.
   -Pulmonology feels that his right pleural effusion is chronic and his
   respiratory status has improved, so it is felt that it is less likely
   to be the source of his fevers. Consider thoracentesis only if
   continues to be febrile without source. Would need CT beforehand. No
   bronch at the moment.
   -Stool guaiac negative
   -Heme/Onc consult feels picture is consistent with anemia of Chronic
   Disease vs [**Doctor First Name **] (iron 35)  vs Myelodysplastic disorder (less likely).
   Consider outpatient colonscopy and epogen. Given fever and lack of
   leukocytosis also consider HIV test-> per conversation with patient he
   does have risk factors but is currently refusing to be tested because
   he does not want to disturb his home family life. Heme recommended
   SPEP, UPEP, repeat IHOS (peripheral smear), folate, and B12 which are

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm at 10AM.
   -Pulmonology feels that his right pleural effusion is chronic and his
   respiratory status has improved, so it is felt that it is less likely
   to be the source of his fevers. Consider thoracentesis only if
   continues to be febrile without source. Would need CT beforehand. No
   bronch at the moment.
   -Stool guaiac negative
   -Heme/Onc consult feels picture is consistent with anemia of Chronic
   Disease vs [**Doctor First Name **] (iron 35)  vs Myelodysplastic disorder (less likely).
   Consider outpatient colonscopy and epogen. Given fever and lack of

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and PAF. He presented with fatigue, fever of unknown origin, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). He underwent cardioversion and spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm (SR) at 10 AM.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and his right pleural effusion is chronic. There are no plans for bronchoscopy at this time. The stool guaiac is negative, indicating no signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's blood work shows anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL and a hematocrit of 24.2%. The platelet count is increasing, but still low at 214,000/mm3. The serum creatinine is elevated at 3.1 mg/dL, likely due to pre-renal hypovolemia secondary to recent illness.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including amiodarone for rhythm control, metoprolol for rate control, lasix for fluid management, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. He is also on insulin for poorly controlled diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). He presented with fatigue and fever of unknown origin, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). He underwent cardioversion and converted to sinus rhythm.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient has been treated with various medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, diltiazem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He is also receiving heparin sodium, which is being titrated based on his activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) levels.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.0 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm at 10AM on [**7-29**]
   -Pulmonology feels that his right pleural effusion is chronic and his
   respiratory status has improved, so it is felt that it is less likely
   to be the source of his fevers. Consider thoracentesis only if
   continues to be febrile without source. Would need CT beforehand. No
   bronch at the moment.
   -Stool guaiac negative
   -Heme/Onc consult feels picture is consistent with anemia of Chronic
   Disease vs [**Doctor First Name **] (iron 35)  vs Myelodysplastic disorder (less likely).
   Consider outpatient colonscopy and epogen. Given fever and lack of
   leukocytosis also consider HIV test-> per conversation with patient he
   does have risk factors but is currently refusing to be tested because
   he does not want to disturb his home family life. Heme recommended
   SPEP, UPEP, repeat IHOS (peripheral smear), folate, and B12 which are
   all pending. No rheumatologic workup for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, who presented with fatigue, fever of unknown origin, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent cardioversion and converted to sinus rhythm. He has been receiving amiodarone, metoprolol, and diltiazem for his cardiac condition.

The patient's fever is suspected to be due to pneumonia, which was initially treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, his fever persisted, and ciprofloxacin was added to broaden the coverage. Despite this, the patient's fever continues, and further investigation is needed to identify the source. AFB sputum has been negative three times, and TB precautions have been removed. Blood cultures, urine culture, and loose stool sample for C. diff have also been negative.

The patient's coronary arteries are compromised, leading to a troponin leak likely due to acute renal failure and increased cardiac demand caused by rapid ventricular response. Metoprolol has been continued, and lisinopril will be restarted when the patient's blood pressure and creatinine levels are stable.

The patient's chest X-ray shows improving lung infiltrates, and he is still receiving intravenous lasix. His leg edema has increased, so he will be switched to oral lasix"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm at 10AM on [**7-29**]
   -Pulmonology feels that his right pleural effusion is chronic and his
   respiratory status has improved, so it is felt that it is less likely
   to be the source of his fevers. Consider thoracentesis only if
   continues to be febrile without source. Would need CT beforehand. No
   bronch at the moment.
   -Stool guaiac negative
   -Heme/Onc consult feels picture is consistent with anemia of Chronic
   Disease vs [**Doctor First Name **] (iron 35)  vs Myelodysplastic disorder (less likely).
   Consider outpatient colonscopy and epogen. Given fever and lack of
   leukocytosis also consider HIV test-> per conversation with patient he
   does have risk factors but is currently refusing to be tested because
   he does not want to disturb his home family life. Heme recommended

2. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever for an extended period, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, the fever persists, suggesting a need for further evaluation and management.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient has shown signs of pneumonia, with infiltrates on the left side of the chest. The presence of crackles at the right lung base indicates potential worsening of the lung condition. Monitoring and treatment for respiratory problems should continue.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are below normal, indicating anemia. This may be due to chronic disease or another underlying cause. Further investigation is required to determine the cause and appropriate management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, who presented with fatigue and fever of unknown origin. The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and underwent cardioversion, which successfully converted him to sinus rhythm.

The patient's fever is believed to be due to pneumonia, and other potential sources such as liver, GI, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and TB have been ruled out. The patient is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's coronary arteries are showing troponin leak likely due to ARF and demand. Metoprolol and lisinopril are being continued, and the patient's blood pressure and creatinine levels will be monitored.

The patient's CXR is continuously improving, with reduced infiltrates on the left side. The patient is still on IV lasix and may require additional diuretics for increased leg edema.

The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are being evaluated, with a hematology review of the peripheral smear. The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, and adjustments to his insulin dosage have been made.

The patient's sodium levels are resolving, and his creatinine levels have improved from 3.4 to"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm at 10AM on [**7-29**]
   -Pulmonology feels that his right pleural effusion is chronic and his
   respiratory status has improved, so it is felt that it is less likely
   to be the source of his fevers. Consider thoracentesis only if
   continues to be febrile without source. Would need CT beforehand. No
   bronch at the moment.
   -Stool guaiac negative
   -Heme/Onc consult feels picture is consistent with anemia of Chronic
   Disease vs [**Doctor First Name **] (iron 35)  vs Myelodysplastic disorder (less likely).
   Consider outpatient colonscopy and epogen. Given fever and lack of
   leukocytosis also consider HIV test-> per conversation with patient he
   does have risk factors but is currently refusing to be tested because
   he does not want to disturb his home family life. Heme recommended
   SPEP, UPEP, repeat IHOS (peripheral smear), folate, and B12 which are
   all pending. No rheumatologic workup for now.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, PAF, who presented with fatigue, fever of unknown origin, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent cardioversion and converted to sinus rhythm. 

The patient's current condition includes a right pleural effusion, which is chronic and has improved respiratory status. The source of fever is still unknown, and further investigation is needed. The patient has anemia of chronic disease, and further evaluation with outpatient colonoscopy and epogen is recommended. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, and a peripheral smear has been ordered. 

The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, with an A1c level of 10.5%. His sodium levels are resolving, and his creatinine level has improved from yesterday's value. The patient's lower extremity edema and ulcers are slightly worse, and wound care consultation is advised. 

The patient is currently receiving IV antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam), metoprolol, heparin, and lasix. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and stool sample have all come back negative. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 133/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

Overall, the patient's condition remains stable, and further investigations are ongoing to determine the source of fever and to manage the patient's various medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever of unknown origin, found
   to be in Afib with RVR, now s/p cardioversion and in NSR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: TEE with cardioversion performed [**7-24**].  Went back into Afib to
   the 110s last night and diltiazem 30mg QID was restarted.  Patient
   hemodynamically stable.  Likely [**1-21**] PAF, hoping that once amiodarone
   builds up, he will convert into NSR.
   - Continue amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - On metoprolol at home dose
   - added diltiazem overnight
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully, but in A-fib again. Will rate control;
   consider repeat cardioversion if amiodarone not working after 1 month.
   #Fever:  Probably due to pneumonia.  Ruled out liver, GI, endocarditis,
   osteomyelitis, TB.  TB precautions removed.  ID consulted and have
   recommended to D/C all antibiotics today since the patient has been
   afebrile for about 48 hours.
    - Received a total of 9 days of vanc, 10 days of zosyn, and 6 days of
   cipro.
   - AFB sputum negative x 3.  TB precautions removed on [**7-27**].
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urine culture- negative
   - loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**]
 negative
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  CXR continuely improving.  Infiltrates on left side reduced.
   Still on IV lasix.
   - Switch to lasix 120mg PO daily, may need more diuresis for increased
   leg edema.
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   # Anemia: H/H 7/22.7 this AM. Consider transfusion if becomes
   symptomatic. Guaiac all stools.
   # Thrombocytopenia: .
   - Increasing over last few days.  Up to 257 today (123 earlier on in
   the week))
   - ordered for peripheral smear; will have hematology review it for plt
   and possible immature wbc forms
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Have increased home glargine to 54U QAM given the D5 he is getting
   with his Abx
   - ISS
   # Hyponatremia: Resolving.  Na is 133 this AM
   -trend Na for now
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2.  Cr still elevated to 3.4, low 3s may be new
   baseline.
   -encourage PO intake
   -IVF as needed
   # Anemia: baseline hct~27.  22.7 this AM.  No signs/symptoms of
   bleeding.  Appreciate heme recs, will follow-up with heme today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), who presented with fatigue and fever of unknown origin. The patient underwent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is now in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). 

The patient's recent events include going back into atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 110s, for which diltiazem 30mg PO QID was started. He also developed epigastric discomfort and anxiety and was given Maalox and lorazepam. The patient complained of lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which is limiting his movement.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 07/29/2154 at 10:00 PM, vancomycin on 07/30/2154 at 08:10 AM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 07/31/2154 at 04:20 AM. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 109 beats per minute (bpm) with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 106/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 117.6 kg, and his height is 71 inches.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,151 mL (including 220 mL of total intravenous fluids), output of 1,425 mL (including 450 mL of urine), resulting in a negative balance of 274 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results are as follows: pH 7.0, PaCO2 28 mmHg, HCO3- 22.7 mEq/L, SaO2 98%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in his general appearance, neck, or heart. His lungs show crackles at the right lung base and occasional expiratory wheezing, while his abdomen is described as overweight with mild tenderness. The patient has bilateral 2+ pitting edema and stasis ulcer on the right shin with surrounding erythema, as well as multiple toe blisters.

The patient's laboratory results indicate the following values: leukocyte count of 257 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 22.7%, platelet count of 191 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) of 3.4 mg/dL, glucose of 191 mg/dL, sodium of 133 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride of 96 mEq/L, calcium of 8.3 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever of unknown origin, found
   to be in Afib with RVR, now s/p cardioversion and in NSR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: TEE with cardioversion performed [**7-24**].  Went back into Afib to
   the 110s last night and diltiazem 30mg QID was restarted.  Patient
   hemodynamically stable.  Likely [**1-21**] PAF, hoping that once amiodarone
   builds up, he will convert into NSR.
   - Continue amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - On metoprolol at home dose
   - added diltiazem overnight
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully, but in A-fib again. Will rate control;
   consider repeat cardioversion if amiodarone not working after 1 month.
   #Fever:  Probably due to pneumonia.  Ruled out liver, GI, endocarditis,
   osteomyelitis, TB.  TB precautions removed.  ID consulted and have
   recommended to D/C all antibiotics today since the patient has been
   afebrile for about 48 hours.
    - Received a total of 9 days of vanc, 10 days of zosyn, and 6 days of
   cipro.
   - AFB sputum negative x 3.  TB precautions removed on [**7-27**].
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urine culture- negative
   - loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**7-24**]
 negative
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**1-21**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  CXR continuely improving.  Infiltrates on left side reduced.
   Still on IV lasix.
   - Switch to lasix 120mg PO daily, may need more diuresis for increased
   leg edema.
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   # Anemia: H/H 7/22.7 this AM. Consider transfusion if becomes
   symptomatic. Guaiac negative.
   # Thrombocytopenia: .
   - Increasing over last few days.  Up to 257 today (123 earlier on in
   the week))
   - ordered for peripheral smear; will have hematology review it for plt
   and possible immature wbc forms
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Have increased home glargine to 54U QAM given the D5 he is getting
   with his Abx
   - ISS
   # Hyponatremia: Resolving.  Na is 133 this AM
   -trend Na for now
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2.  Cr still elevated to 3.4, low 3s may be new

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), presenting with fatigue and fever of unknown origin. He underwent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate in the 110s, blood pressure of 106/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His weight is 117.6 kg, and he has a height of 71 inches.

The patient has developed several medical complications during his ICU stay. These include:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient initially presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was successfully cardioverted to NSR but went back into atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 110s. Diltiazem 30mg PO QID was started to control the heart rate.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient presented with fatigue and fever of unknown origin. After ruling out various causes such as pneumonia, liver, gastrointestinal, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and tuberculosis, the fever was likely attributed to pneumonia. Antibiotics were continued"

   the 110s last night and diltiazem 30mg QID was restarted.  Patient
   hemodynamically stable.  Likely [**1-21**] PAF, hoping that once amiodarone
   builds up, he will convert into NSR.
   - Continue amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - On metoprolol at home dose
   - added diltiazem overnight
   - TEE did not show any vegetations or atrial clots.  Patient
   cardioverted successfully, but in A-fib again. Will rate control;
   consider repeat cardioversion if amiodarone not working after 1 month.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of single-vessel CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), who presented with fatigue and fever of unknown origin. He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and underwent cardioversion, which successfully restored normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient's hemodynamic stability is maintained with the use of diltiazem and amiodarone.

The patient's fever has resolved, and all cultures and tests have come back negative, ruling out various infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, tuberculosis (TB), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient has been afebrile for about 48 hours, and ID recommended discontinuing all antibiotics.

The patient's coronary arteries are showing signs of troponin leak likely due to reperfusion injury or demand ischemia given the rapid ventricular response. Metoprolol and lisinopril therapy have been continued, and the patient's blood pressure and creatinine levels are being closely monitored.

The patient's chest X-ray shows continuous improvement, with reduced infiltrates on the left side. He is still receiving intravenous lasix, and the dose may be adjusted based on his fluid status.

The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin/hematocrit of 7/22.7%, and transfusion may be considered if he becomes symptomatic. Thrombocytopenia is also present, with a platelet count of 257 K/uL, and a peripheral smear has been ordered.

The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, with an A1c level of 10.5%. His glargine dosage has been increased to 54U QAM due to the dextrose in his antibiotics.

The patient's sodium levels are resolving, and his baseline creatinine is around 2, with a current level of 3.4. He is encouraged to maintain oral intake and receive intravenous fluids as needed.

The patient has been advised to follow up with hematology for further evaluation of his thrombocytopenia and immature white blood cell forms. Wound care consult recommendations have also been appreciated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation and potential need for repeat cardioversion.
2. Development of kidney injury or worsening renal function due to ongoing troponin leak or other factors.
3. Poor glycemic control and potential complications related to diabetes.
4. Thrombocytopenia and potential bleeding complications.
5. Anemia and potential need for transfusion.
6. Lower extremity edema and ulcers, which could worsen if not properly managed.
7. Possible complications associated with prolonged immobilization and bed rest.
8. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and anticoagulation therapy.
9. Infection risk due to indwelling lines and catheters.
10. Potential complications related to prolonged use of intravenous medications and fluids."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   His nebs were changed to PRN.  ID recommended to d/c vanco yesterday
   and to stop antibiotics this morning since he remained afebrile.  Wound
   care saw the patient and made recs regarding his venous stasis and leg
   ulcers.  He has been satting well on 3L NC and had no respiratory
   distress.  At 2200 he went back into Afib with a HR in the 110s and
   diltiazem 30mg PO QID was started.  He also developed epigastric
   discomfort and anxiety this morning and was given Maalox and lorazepam.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of single-vessel CABG (coronary artery bypass graft), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and pneumonia. The patient presented with fatigue and fever of unknown origin, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). He underwent cardioversion and is now in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 109 beats per minute (bpm) in AFib, blood pressure of 106/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 117.6 kg, and height is 71 inches. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25700 cells/microliter, elevated creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 191 mg/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 132,000 cells/microliter. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile (PTT/INR), and electrolyte imbalances.

   24 Hour Events:
   His nebs were changed to PRN.  ID recommended to d/c vanco yesterday
   and to stop antibiotics this morning since he remained afebrile.  Wound
   care saw the patient and made recs regarding his venous stasis and leg
   ulcers.  He has been satting well on 3L NC and had no respiratory
   distress.  At 2200 he went back into Afib with a HR in the 110s and
   diltiazem 30mg PO QID was started.  He also developed epigastric
   discomfort and anxiety this morning and was given Maalox and
   lorazepam.  He is also complaining of lower back pain and bilateral hip
   pain limiting his movement.
