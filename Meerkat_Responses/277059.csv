   possible OR today if worsens.  Differential ischemic bowel vs.
   functional ileus [**1-10**] narcotics vs. ?incarcerated hernia (though
   reducible on exam and CT read by surgery attending on call does not
   appear incarcerated).  Pt has no history of abdominal surgeries in the
   past.
   - Monitor abdomen closely
   - f/u General Surgery recs
   - NGT to suction

   Morphine for chest pain
   .
   # s/p NSTEMI:  Patient presented with angina that was initially
   medically managed on Heparin, Integrillin, Nitro gtt, and morphine, but
   had refractory symptoms.  Patient was taken for cardiac catheterization
   and was found to have diffuse triple vessel disease including 50% LMCA
   stenoss and subtotal occlusion of the RCA.  The patient had anatomy
   that is suitable for CABG.  The patient has been evaluated by CT
   Surgery, original plan for medical management overnight and CABG in AM
   but CABG on hold now per CT surgery given acute abdomen.  Pt did
   receive one dose of plavix on AM of [**9-30**].  LDL 182.  Integrillin off
   at 4am [**10-1**].  Heparin off in anticipation of possible procedure today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of stable angina who presented with chest pain and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have triple vessel disease. 

The patient developed nausea, chest sourness, diaphoresis overnight, and an EKG showed concerning for worsening ST depression in the inferior and lateral leads, as well as flattening of T waves in the lateral leads. The attending physician and fellow decided to medically manage the symptoms until the morning. 

The patient was given IV morphine and Zofran for symptoms, but later experienced abdominal distension and ordered a stat KUB (kidney-ureter-bladder) X-ray. However, the symptoms had resolved by the time the X-ray tech arrived, and the nurse decided not to wake the patient for the procedure due to concern for a catecholamine surge when the patient was anxious. 

The next morning, the patient was found to have significant abdominal pain with worsening distension and a tense abdomen. The patient was complaining of nausea and abdominal pain. A stat CT abdomen showed dilated loops of bowel and a hernia, which surgery initially did not feel was incarcerated. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 92/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and they are receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 15.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.4 g/dL, blood glucose of 150 mg/dL, and troponin T of 0.86 ng/mL. Other labs are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include potential bowel obstruction, with a CT abdomen final read pending. The patient has an NG tube in place, and general surgery is following with serial abdominal exams, with a possible trip to the operating room (OR) today if symptoms worsen. 

There is also a concern for s/p NSTEMI, with the patient initially medically managed and then taken for cardiac catheterization. The patient was found to have diffuse triple vessel disease, including 50% left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis and subtotal occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's anatomy is suitable for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), but the procedure is currently on hold due to the acute abdomen. 

The patient received one dose of Plavix on the morning of [9-30], and Integrillin was turned off at 4am on [10-1]. Heparin was also turned off in anticipation of a possible procedure today. 

The patient's care will involve monitoring"
