","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 8486], a 73-year-old female with a history of COPD, pneumonia, and multiple comorbidities, presented to the ICU with flu-like symptoms. She was admitted for hypotension but is now resolved. The patient's symptoms are improving, and she is nearly back to baseline oxygenation. She likely has a mild increase in interstitial fluid following volume resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Influenza-like illness: The patient initially presented with symptoms resembling influenza, but subsequent tests ruled out influenza A and B.
2. Tachycardia: The patient experienced tachycardia, which has since resolved after being adequately resuscitated with fluids.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient had ARF, which has resolved.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD and is being managed with outpatient treatment, including oxygen therapy and bronchodilators. However, there is a concern about some component of volume overload due to the use of noninvasive ventilation.
5. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient did not tolerate CPAP therapy as an outpatient and is currently on 2 L nasal cannula oxygen at night. Oxygen supplementation will continue.
6. Hypertension (HTN): Lisinopril will be restarted upon discharge.
7. Hypothyroidism"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and hypoxia. He has been receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 121/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and elevated potassium levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and worsening respiratory symptoms could indicate a possible pneumonia, which is common in patients with COPD.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic heparin is being given to reduce this risk.
3. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, indicating a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the use of corticosteroids or other medications that"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of COPD, pneumonia, and other medical conditions such as ARF, OSA, HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, breast cancer, and depression. She presented with flu-like symptoms and was admitted to the ICU for hypotension. Her vital signs have stabilized, and she is now tolerating oral intake. Her lab results show some fluctuations in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and glucose levels. Imaging tests reveal mild pulmonary edema but no consolidation or pneumothorax. The patient has been ruled out for influenza infection. The plan is to continue with supportive care, including fluids and Tylenol as needed, maintain oxygen levels within a target range, and restart certain medications upon discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The presence of mild pulmonary edema indicates potential respiratory distress, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: Despite ruling out influenza, there is a possibility of other infections due to her weakened immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of hypertension and cardiac conditions make her susceptible to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding: The use of heparin for DVT prophylaxis increases the risk of bleeding, especially if the patient's platelet count drops further.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 8486] is a 73-year-old female with a history of COPD, pneumonia, and other medical conditions such as hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, breast cancer, and depression. She presented with flu-like symptoms and was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, which has since resolved. The patient's symptoms are improving, and she is nearly back to baseline oxygenation. The note mentions potential medical complications related to her conditions, including pulmonary edema, volume overload, and the need for oxygen supplementation due to COPD and OSA. There is also a mention of restarting Lisinopril for hypertension upon discharge and continuing other home regimens for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of mild pulmonary edema is indicated by the new vascular congestion and increased interstitial markings seen on the chest X-ray. This can be a complication of fluid overload or heart failure.
2. Volume Overload: The patient may have some component of volume overload, particularly given her history of COPD. This can contribute to pulmonary edema and should be carefully managed.
3. Hypotension: Although resolved, the patient initially presented with hypotension, which required admission to the ICU. This could have been due to sepsis or another underlying cause.
4. Influenza-like illness: The patient initially presented with flu-like symptoms, but subsequent tests were negative for influenza"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8486**] is a 73 y.o. F with COPD, history of pneumonia, who
   presented with 1 week of flu-like symptoms, admitted to ICU for
   hypotension, now resolved.
   .
   # Influenza like illness: Will continue with supportive care, with
   fluids and tylenol prn. Influenza negative.
   Symptoms are continuing to improve. She is not critically ill, and
   nearly back to baseline oxygenation. Likely has mild increase in
   interstitial fluid following volume resus.
   .
   # COPD: Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1513**] as outpatient.
   - goal oxygen O2 89-93% given COPD; currently on NC likely [**2-28**] some
   component of volume overload
   - continue home regimen of albuterol, ipatropium
   .
   # OSA: Did not tolerate CPAP as outpatient, on 2 L NC at night
   - continue oxygen supplementation
   .
   # HTN: Restart Lisinopril upon discharge.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home regimen of Levothyroxine
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home regimen of Simvastatin
   .
   # H/o breast CA: Continue home Aromasin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of COPD, pneumonia, hypotension, and other medical conditions. She presented with flu-like symptoms and was admitted to the ICU. Her hypotension has resolved, and her oxygenation is improving. She has mild pulmonary edema but is not critically ill. The patient's symptoms are continuing to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has developed new mild pulmonary edema as indicated by increased interstitial markings in the lower lobes bilaterally and mild perihilar haziness on the chest X-ray. This can be a result of volume overload or heart failure. Monitoring her respiratory status and fluid balance is important to prevent worsening of the edema.

2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and her symptoms may be exacerbated by the recent infection and fluid overload. Close monitoring of her oxygenation and respiratory effort is necessary. Adjustments to her oxygen therapy and bronchodilators may be required.

3. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, it is essential to monitor her blood pressure closely to detect any recurrence. Appropriate fluid management and medication adjustments will be needed to maintain stable blood pressure.

4. Infection: The patient initially presented with flu-like symptoms, and there is a possibility of ongoing infection. Regular monitoring of vital signs, white blood cell count, and other laboratory parameters"
