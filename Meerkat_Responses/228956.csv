","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman who is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hypertension, volume overload, a liver lesion, and bradycardia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 178/49 to 199/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including propofol, fentanyl, heparin sodium, ceftriaxone, PPI captopril, and clonidine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia (PNA) and volume overload. The medical team will continue with antibiotics (Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone) and plan to switch the patient to pressure support ventilation (PSV) to maintain oxygenation and adequate minute ventilation.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has a goal to run a negative fluid balance of -500 cc to manage the volume overload.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be titrated up with antihypertensive medication.
4. Liver Lesion: Further imaging, possibly an MRI, is required when the patient is extubated to evaluate the liver lesion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with dementia who is currently in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, deconditioning, and acute illness. The patient also has hypertension, a liver lesion, and bradycardia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is unable to maintain oxygenation and adequate minute ventilation while on partial support ventilation (PSV). She still requires significant ventilatory support.

2. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake of 2,629 mL and output of 1,667 mL since 12 AM, indicating potential volume overload. This may contribute to her respiratory failure and hypertension.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently high, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to further complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.

4. Liver Lesion: The patient has an unidentified liver lesion that requires follow-up with better imaging, possibly an MRI, when she is extubated. Further investigation is needed to determine the nature and significance of the liver lesion.

5. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently low (bradycardia), which may be related to her medication regimen, specifically the use of propofol and high-d"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia. She was admitted to the ICU intubated after presenting with hypoxia and tachypnea. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: The patient presented with hypoxia and tachypnea, and her chest X-ray is consistent with left upper lobe consolidation pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the likely causative agent. Contributing factors may include congestive heart failure given her pleural effusions and the use of Lasix. No significant risk factors for MRSA or pseudomonas are present, so treatment for community-acquired pneumonia will be initiated. The patient is currently intubated on assist-control ventilation.

2. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated but without a clear etiology. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

3. Hypertension: The patient is on an aggressive regimen at home including beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and an ACE inhibitor. Due to bradycardia, restarting nodal agents is not recommended, but the afterload reducers will be titrated as tolerated.

4. Alzheimer's dementia: The patient is not currently on any medications for this condition per her daughter's report. The patient's severe dementia often results in her not recognizing her daughter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia. She was admitted to the ICU intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea. Her chest X-ray shows consolidation in the left upper lobe, suggesting pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and slightly high creatinine levels. She has multiple medical conditions including elevated liver enzymes, hypertension, and breast cancer. She also has a history of a lower back pressure ulcer and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to pneumonia, which can lead to further hypoxia and potential sepsis.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed, as uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Elevated Liver Enzymes: The cause of elevated liver enzymes should be investigated to determine the appropriate management and prevent any further liver damage.
4. Breast Cancer: The patient's breast cancer history should be taken into consideration, and any necessary treatment or intervention should be discussed and implemented accordingly.
5. Pressure Ulcer: The patient's existing pressure ulcer needs proper wound care and prevention of further deterioration. Regular repositioning and appropriate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia.
- She was admitted intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea, and her chest X-ray showed consolidation pneumonia.
- She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and pneumonia, and is currently on aggressive treatment for CAP.
- The patient's LFTs are elevated but without clear etiology.
- She has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with multiple medications.
- She also has Alzheimer's dementia and breast cancer.
- She has a pressure ulcer on her lower back and is diet-controlled for diabetes.
- The patient's code status is full code, and emergency contact is her granddaughter.
- She is currently in the ICU and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she develops further complications such as pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, and it could progress to a more severe infection if not properly managed.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may not be adequately controlled despite the aggressive medication regimen, which can increase the risk of complications.
4. Pressure Ulcer: The patient's pressure ulcer may worsen if proper wound care and repositioning are not maintained.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may not be well-controlled, leading to complications related to hypergly"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, hypertension, and a liver lesion. They are currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation but high blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,570 mL and output of 2,585 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 15 mL. The patient has received various medications including propofol, heparin sodium, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with low platelet count. The patient's electrolytes and liver enzymes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if they are unable to maintain oxygenation and adequate ventilation while on pressure support ventilation (PSV).
2. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid balance suggests volume overload, which needs to be managed to prevent further complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be carefully monitored and managed to prevent any potential organ damage.
4. Liver Lesion: The liver lesion requires further evaluation and management, particularly when the patient is extubated.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia should be monitored and managed appropriately to ensure adequate cardiac function.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, breast cancer, and respiratory failure. She is currently admitted to the ICU and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's recent events include attempts at pressure support ventilation (PSV) with varying success. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5 C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 177/58 mmHg to 191/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 2,570 mL and output of 2,585 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 15 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 16.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 136 to 212 mg/dL, and an electrolyte panel within normal limits. Imaging studies show a liver lesion that requires further evaluation when the patient is extubated.

Plan:
The patient's respiratory failure is improving, allowing for successful trials of PSV. However, several challenges remain before extubation, including pneumonia, volume overload, and poor mental status. The plan is to attempt diuresis this morning and uptitrate blood pressure medications in anticipation of possible extubation this afternoon if the patient passes a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is attributed to pneumonia (PNA) and volume overload. The patient also has hypertension (HTN) and a liver lesion, which requires further investigation once she is extubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within the normal range and a blood pressure that is under control. She is receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube, with a tidal volume set at 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The FiO2 is 40% and the PEEP is 5 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases show a slightly elevated pH, low carbon dioxide levels, and adequate oxygenation. The laboratory results indicate a slightly elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes, as well as low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, antihypertensive medication, and supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure due to PNA and volume overload needs to be closely monitored for any worsening of lung function or development of new respiratory complications.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload, as indicated by the positive fluid balance and elevated blood pressure. Monitoring and managing fluid intake and output will be important to prevent further fluid accumulation.
3. Hypertension: Although the"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known firstname 4861**], a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia, was transferred from the emergency department intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea. She presented with wheezing and labored breathing, requiring BiPAP support and nebulizers. A chest X-ray showed decreased pleural effusions and increased prominence of left lower lobe opacification, suggesting pneumonia. The patient was extubated but developed wheezing again, leading to the decision to keep her on BiPAP. She received ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation with hypoxia and tachypnea, along with the CXR findings, indicate the possibility of pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory failure and potentially sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypertension: Despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. Aggressive blood pressure control is necessary to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Chronic Aspiration: Given the patient's history of chronic aspiration, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate precautions, such as elevating the head of bed and performing regular oral care"

   Assessment and Plan
","Summary:
The patient is a 4-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been placed on non-invasive ventilation due to increased work of breathing and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (azithromycin and ceftriaxone) for suspected bacterial infection. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 112 bpm), hypertension (blood pressure of 169/67 mmHg), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula with FiO2 set at 35%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,409 mL and output of 1,780 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 629 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.0 K/uL and thrombocytosis with a Plt count of 356 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's physical examination findings are incomplete due to not being assessed in several areas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for non-invasive ventilation indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and appropriate intervention are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The administration of antibiotics suggests a suspected bacterial infection. Close monitoring"

   accessory muscles, 1 hr later and put on BiPAP 10/5 with improvement.
   also got lasix and nebs.
   - CXR at time of wheezing showed decreased pleural effusions and
   increased prominence of LLL opacification but nothing acute
   - family was concerned that patient was ""extubated too early"" but tried
   to reassure them that she met parameters for extubation
   - started on standing hydralazine for hypertension
   - stayed on BiPAP all day. Taken off in early evening but got
   tachypnic.  Taken off later in the evening and did well, remained on 2L
   NC overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known firstname 4861**], a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia, was transferred from the emergency department intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea. She was extubated in the morning but developed wheezing and labored breathing, so she was put on BiPAP 10/5 with improvement. She received Lasix and nebs as well. A chest X-ray showed decreased pleural effusions and increased prominence of left lower lobe opacification, but nothing acute was observed. The family expressed concern that the patient was extubated too early, but the medical team reassured them that she met the parameters for extubation. The patient started on standing hydralazine for hypertension. She remained on BiPAP all day and was taken off in the early evening but experienced tachypnea. Later, she was successfully extubated and remained on 2L NC overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxia and tachypnea, and there were concerns about pneumonia due to consolidation seen on the initial chest X-ray. However, cultures remained negative, and a large mucus plug was found after intubation. It is unclear if pneumonia was the primary source of distress.

   Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4863**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of
   HTN, DM, likely chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia who was
   transferred from the ED intubated after presenting with hypoxia and
   tachypnea.
   24 Hour Events:
   - extubated in a.m. but developed wheezing and labored breathing, using
   accessory muscles, 1 hr later and put on BiPAP 10/5 with improvement.
   also got lasix and nebs.
   - CXR at time of wheezing showed decreased pleural effusions and
   increased prominence of LLL opacification but nothing acute
   - family was concerned that patient was ""extubated too early"" but tried
   to reassure them that she met parameters for extubation
   - started on standing hydralazine for hypertension
   - stayed on BiPAP all day. Taken off in early evening but got
   tachypnic.  Taken off later in the evening and did well, remained on 2L
   NC overnight.

   the ED intubated after presenting with hypoxia and tachypnea.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Patient presented with hypoxia and tachypnea
   and initial CXR with LUL consolidation. However, unclear if this
   definitively suggests pneumonia, as cultures have remained negative and
   pt had large mucous plug after intubation. Has also had significant
   pulmonary edema, likely due to her CHF and MR, possibly the primary
   source of her distress.
   - doing well post extubation, but in worsening pulmonary edema
   - Goal neg 2L today: IV lasix 40mg
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro (on day 6 today), plan for 7 day
   course.
   - all cultures with neg (sputum with polys but no growth)
   - midline placement requested for IV diuresis and antibiotics.
   #. Hypertension:  Started on hydral IV and clonidine patch yest due to
   inability to tolerate PO. Now restarting home meds via NGT.
   #.Alzheimer's dementia:  Not currently on any medications for this per
   daughter.  [**Name (NI) 4980**] severe, as patient frequently does not recognize her
   [**Name (NI) 4862**].
   #. Breast cancer:  No aggressive management, no XRT.  Necrotic mass in
   right axilla.  Appears to be on arimidex.  Will confirm dose with
   pharmacy in a.m.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4863**], a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia, was transferred to the ICU intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea. She has been extubated but experienced wheezing and labored breathing, so she was placed on BiPAP 10/5 with improvement. She received Lasix and nebs, and her CXR showed decreased pleural effusions and increased prominence of left lower lobe opacification. The family was concerned that the patient was extubated too early, but the physician reassured them that the patient met parameters for extubation. She is being given standing hydralazine for hypertension and has been on BiPAP all day. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 164/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurological examination reveals that she is not oriented and responds to verbal stimuli. Her lab results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and altered potassium and sodium levels. The patient's past medical history includes breast cancer, lower back pressure ulcer, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is currently on antibiotics, diuretics, and pain management"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient, a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic aspiration, Alzheimer's dementia, breast cancer, and lower back pressure ulcer, was admitted to the ICU intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea.
- Initial chest X-ray showed left upper lobe consolidation, but cultures remained negative, and a large mucus plug was cleared after intubation.
- The patient has been experiencing significant pulmonary edema, likely due to congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypertension that were treated with medications such as lopressor, digoxin, and hydralazine.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of high-flow oxygen and noninvasive ventilation.
- The patient's labs show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and elevated lactic acid levels.
- The patient is currently on several medications, including lasix, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, metoprolol, clonidine, digoxin, famotidine, and others.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4863**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of HTN, DM,
   ?chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia who was transferred from
   the ED intubated after presenting with hypoxia and tachypnea. Now
   extubated with significant CHF, hypoxia, hemodynamic instability.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Patient presented with hypoxia and tachypnea
   and initial CXR with LUL consolidation. However, unclear if this
   definitively suggests pneumonia, as cultures have remained negative and
   pt had large mucous plug after intubation. New CXR show
s colllapse of
   entire R lung. Has also had significant repeated aspiration and
   pulmonary edema, likely due to her CHF and MR, possibly the primary
   source of her distress.
   - finished abx course
   - will try NT suction as likely mucous plugging that caused atelectasis
   of entire R lung
   # CHF
 pt continues to be fluid overloaded
   - goal to continue -2L today
   #. Hypertension:  Labile, pt required additional captopril and
   hydralizine overnight  as bp was up to 190s.
   -  increased clonidine to 0.2mg TID
   # Leukocytosis: concerning given rise while on antibiotics, however
   afebrile
   - repeat UA/UCx, BCx, c diff
   # Afib: transient, well controlled now on digoxin
   #.Alzheimer's dementia:  Not currently on any medications for this per
   daughter.  [**Name (NI) 4980**] severe, as patient frequently does not recognize her
   daugther.
   #. Breast cancer:  No aggressive management, no XRT.  Necrotic mass in
   right axilla.  Appears to be on arimidex.  Will confirm dose with
   pharmacy in a.m.
   #. Lower back pressure ulcer:  Cares per wound care reccs
   #. DM2:  Diet-controlled; not on insulin at home.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia. She was admitted to the ICU intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea. Currently, she is extubated but experiencing significant congestive heart failure (CHF), hypoxia, and hemodynamic instability. The patient has a breast cancer history with no aggressive management or radiation therapy. She also has a lower back pressure ulcer and diabetes mellitus type 2 controlled by diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with hypoxia and tachypnea, and initial chest X-ray showed left upper lobe consolidation. However, it is unclear if this indicates pneumonia since cultures have remained negative. The patient has had significant repeated aspiration and pulmonary edema, likely due to her CHF and mitral regurgitation (MR), possibly the primary source of her distress.
   - Goal: Negative 2 liters today, IV Lasix bolus and gtt; [Hospital1] lytes.
   - Finished abx course.
2. Leukocytosis: Concerning given rise while on antibiotics, however afebrile.
   - Repeat urine analysis/urine culture, blood culture, Clostridium difficile test.
3. Hypertension: Labile but generally well controlled on metoprolol, ACE inhibitor clonidine patch via NGT.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an elderly female with a history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia.
- She was transferred from the emergency department (ED) intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea.
- Now extubated, the patient has significant congestive heart failure (CHF), hypoxia, and hemodynamic instability.
- The patient experienced repeated episodes of hypotension, requiring adjustments in medication dosages and fluid restriction.
- She also had leukocytosis despite being on antibiotics, but remained afebrile.
- The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation (A-fib) but is now well-controlled on digoxin.
- There were concerns about potential infections, including a breast cancer history with necrotic mass and a lower back pressure ulcer.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) that is diet-controlled.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxia and tachypnea, and further investigations revealed a collapsed right lung due to mucous plugging. This indicates a risk of ongoing respiratory distress and the need for appropriate suctioning and clearance of secretions.

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient exhibits signs of fluid overload"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4863**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of HTN, DM,
   ?chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia who was transferred from
   the ED intubated after presenting with hypoxia and tachypnea. Now
   extubated with significant CHF, hypoxia, hemodynamic instability.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Patient presented with hypoxia and tachypnea
   and initial CXR with LUL consolidation. However, unclear if this
   definitively suggests pneumonia, as cultures have remained negative and
   pt had large mucous plug after intubation. New CXR show
s colllapse of
   entire R lung. Has also had significant repeated aspiration and
   pulmonary edema, likely due to her CHF and MR, possibly the primary
   source of her distress.
   - finished abx course
   - will try NT suction as likely mucous plugging that caused atelectasis
   of entire R lung
   # CHF
 pt continues to be fluid overloaded
   - goal to continue -2L today
   #. Hypertension:  Labile, pt required additional captopril and
   hydralizine overnight  as bp was up to 190s.
   -  increased clonidine to 0.2mg TID
   # Leukocytosis: concerning given rise while on antibiotics, however
   afebrile
   - repeat UA/UCx, BCx, c diff
   # Afib: transient, well controlled now on digoxin
   #.Alzheimer's dementia:  Not currently on any medications for this per
   daughter.  [**Name (NI) 4980**] severe, as patient frequently does not recognize her
   daugther.
   #. Breast cancer:  No aggressive management, no XRT.  Necrotic mass in
   right axilla.  Appears to be on arimidex.  Will confirm dose with
   pharmacy in a.m.
   #. Lower back pressure ulcer:  Cares per wound care reccs
   #. DM2:  Diet-controlled; not on insulin at home.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4863**], a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia, was admitted to the ICU intubated after presenting with hypoxia and tachypnea. She is now extubated but continues to experience significant congestive heart failure (CHF), hypoxia, and hemodynamic instability. The patient has had multiple complications, including respiratory failure, CHF, hypertension, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation (Afib), Alzheimer's dementia, breast cancer, a pressure ulcer, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She has been receiving various treatments and medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with hypoxia and tachypnea, and initial chest X-ray showed left upper lobe consolidation. However, it is unclear if this indicates pneumonia, as cultures have remained negative. The patient also had a large mucous plug after intubation. New chest X-rays show collapse of the entire right lung. She has had significant repeated aspiration and pulmonary edema, likely due to her CHF and mitral regurgitation (MR), possibly the primary source of her distress.
2. CHF: The patient continues to be fluid overloaded, and the goal is to continue diuresis by -2L today.
3. Hypertension: The"
