   COMMUNICATION: family and patient
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication noncompliance and was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration. The patient remains massively volume overloaded and is at risk of pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. Etiology of diastolic dysfunction is unknown, with consideration of infiltrative disease, especially with evidence of nephritic range proteinuria. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's massively overloaded volume puts her at risk for developing pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory distress: Due to the combination of massive volume overload and the risk of pulmonary edema, the patient is at risk for respiratory distress.
3. Kidney injury: The patient has acute on chronic kidney disease, and further kidney injury may occur due to volume overload, poor renal flow, and potential nephrotoxins.
4. Infiltrative disease: Given the evidence of nephritic range proteinuria, there is a possibility of infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis affecting the kidneys and heart.
5. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of severe GI bleed, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially if anticoagulation is initiated.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation and bradycardia. If antico"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She is admitted to the CCU for the initiation of ultrafiltration due to decompensated heart failure in the setting of medication non-compliance.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pulmonary edema and respiratory distress: The patient remains massively volume overloaded and is at risk of developing pulmonary edema due to her severe diastolic heart failure. This can lead to respiratory distress and may require interventions such as intubation and mechanical ventilation.

2. Kidney injury: The patient has acute on chronic kidney disease with an increased creatinine level from 1.2-1.4 to 2.1. This indicates impaired renal function, which can further worsen if not managed properly. The patient's urine output is minimal with lasix and metolazone, suggesting a need for further evaluation and management to prevent renal injury.

3. Infection: The presence of cloudy and bloody urine raises concerns about a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). UTI should be considered and monitored for, especially in a hospitalized patient with indwelling catheters.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of severe gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which may be associated with her atrial fibrillation and use of anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring for any"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presents with decompensated heart failure due to medication non-compliance and has been admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient remains massively volume overloaded, which puts her at risk of developing pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. This is a concern because it can lead to difficulty breathing, reduced oxygenation, and potential respiratory failure.

2. Kidney dysfunction: The patient has acute on chronic kidney disease, with an increased creatinine level from 1.2-1.4 to 2.1. The initiation of ultrafiltration for volume removal is planned, but the patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored due to the risk of further kidney damage.

3. Coagulation issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation but is not on anticoagulation due to a history of severe gastrointestinal bleeding. This puts her at risk for thromboembolic events such as stroke or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent these complications.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.7 g/dL, indicating anemia. This could be due to a combination of renal failure and possible gastrointestinal blood loss. Active tracking"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication non-compliance. The patient was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration.

She has been experiencing pain at the line sites, requiring oxycodone for pain control. She denies lightheadedness, dyspnea, chest pain, or other complaints. The patient still requires elevation of the head of bed to sleep comfortably.

Her allergies include Lisinopril, which causes rash and abdominal discomfort, Kefzol (Cefazolin Sodium), causing hives, Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics), causing hives and nausea/vomiting, and shellfish-derived allergens, leading to facial swelling.

The patient is currently on several medications, including Calcium Gluconate (CRRT), Metolazone, Heparin, Mesalamine, Albuterol, Oxycodone, Metoprolol, Gabapentin, Trazodone, ASA, Ferrous sulfate, Folic acid, Omeprazole, and others.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.1-4.3 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 24.8-24.5 g/dL, platelet count of 207-228 thousand/mm³, creatinine level of 2.1-1.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 106-123 mg/dL, and other abnormal values. Urinalysis reveals proteinuria, hematuria, and high urine osmolality.

The patient's physical examination shows an obese abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness, edema to the umbilicus, bibasilar crackles in the lung fields, and significant peripheral edema.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for acute decompensated diastolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, rhythm disturbance, acute on chronic kidney disease, ulcerative colitis, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include pulmonary edema and respiratory distress due to massive volume overload, further deterioration of kidney function, worsening of heart failure symptoms, and potential GI bleeding.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information and does not replace a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional."

   IMAGING:
   [**2108-12-6**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. A septal occluder device is seen across the interatrial septum
   with small amount of persistent interatrial shunting (direction of the
   shunt difficult to pinpoint based on this study). . A small secundum
   atrial septal defect is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
   arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
   Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined, but is likely elevated given
   high right atrial pressures and RV volume overload. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic
   dysfunction and volume overload. Low-normal left ventricular systolic
   function. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Amplatzer-type atrial septal
   occluder with trace residual shunting.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-9-14**], right
   ventricle is slightly smaller. LV function does not appear as vigorous
   and LV cavity is slightly larger, possibly in part due to better
   filling. The other findings are similar.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication non-compliance and was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/62 to 117/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

Her physical examination reveals a mildly thickened mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation, severely thickened tricuspid valve with severe tricuspid regurgitation, and a moderately dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction and volume overload. There is also a septal occluder device across the interatrial septum with trace residual shunting.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Her liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes, and her renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is currently"

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure in the setting of medication noncompliance and was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration. 

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is currently on mesalamine 800mg TID. She has anemia with a Hct of 23, which is slowly trending down. This may be due to renal failure and possible GI loss. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 107/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She is in atrial fibrillation and has a difficult-to-assess pulse due to ankle edema. 

Her laboratory results show a WBC count of 4.1-4.8 K/uL, Hct of 24.5-24.8%, platelet count of 23-230K/uL, creatinine of 1.3-2.1 mg/dL, potassium of 3.8-4.7 mEq/L, sodium of 119-136 mEq/L, chloride of 25-30 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 7.1-7.3 g/dL, BUN of 23-30 mg/dL, glucose of 106-162 mg/dL, and calcium of 10.7 mg/dL. 

The ECHO results indicate a dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction and volume overload, low-normal left ventricular systolic function, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. There is also an Amplatzer-type atrial septal occluder with trace residual shunting. 

The patient experienced crampy abdominal pain and leg pain at 17:30, and her CBC and electrolytes were rechecked, with oxycodone given. By midnight, she was negative for pain. 

The patient's medical allergies include lisinopril, kefzol (Cefazolin Sodium), sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics), and shellfish. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of heart function, worsening renal function, development of infections due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines, and potential bleeding complications given her history of severe GI bleed. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's cardiac function, renal function, electrolyte balance, and overall clinical status to prevent and manage any potential complications."

   IMAGING:
   [**2108-12-6**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. A septal occluder device is seen across the interatrial septum
   with small amount of persistent interatrial shunting (direction of the
   shunt difficult to pinpoint based on this study). . A small secundum
   atrial septal defect is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
   arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
   Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined, but is likely elevated given
   high right atrial pressures and RV volume overload. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic
   dysfunction and volume overload. Low-normal left ventricular systolic
   function. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Amplatzer-type atrial septal
   occluder with trace residual shunting.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-9-14**], right
   ventricle is slightly smaller. LV function does not appear as vigorous
   and LV cavity is slightly larger, possibly in part due to better
   filling. The other findings are similar.
   [**2108-12-6**] Renal U/S (prelim)
   Limited portable examination due to patient body habitus. No
   hydronephrosis of the right or left kidney. Doppler assessment of renal
   vessels suboptimal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.
- The patient presented to the ICU with severe acute kidney injury, hypotension, and fluid overload.
- Initial treatment included fluid restriction, diuretics, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- Echocardiogram showed a dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction and volume overload, low-normal left ventricular systolic function, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and an Amplatzer-type atrial septal occluder with trace residual shunting.
- The patient experienced crampy abdominal pain and leg pain at 17:30, which was likely due to electrolyte imbalances.
- Blood cultures were negative, and the patient received oxycodone for pain relief.
- The patient's vital signs remain unstable, with low blood pressure and decreased urine output.
- Fluid balance continues to show significant positive balance.
- Hemodynamic monitoring indicates ongoing hypotension and signs of fluid overload.
- The patient is receiving aggressive CVVH and has had multiple blood transfusions.
- Laboratory results show worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactic acid levels.
- The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with inadequate oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She was admitted to the CCU for the initiation of ultrafiltration due to medication noncompliance.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute decompensated diastolic heart failure and is not responding to intravenous diuretics. She is currently undergoing ultrafiltration for diuresis. The etiology of her diastolic dysfunction is unknown, and there is a consideration of infiltrative disease, especially with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is experiencing loose stools. She is being continued on mesalamine 800mg TID. Her hemoglobin level is 23, which is slowly trending down. This may be due to anemia of chronic disease, renal failure, and possible GI loss given her prior history.

The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.4, increasing to 2.1 on admission. She has nephrotic range proteinuria and significant edema. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.6 K/uL.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the progress note include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure is severe, and"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of trauma and multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, heart failure (diastolic), pulmonary hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of her chronic conditions and required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

On review of systems, the patient complains of generalized weakness, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 98/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Physical examination reveals sclera anicteric, pink conjunctiva, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, and a malar erythematous rash. The neck is supple with jugular venous distention to the earlobe. Cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, normal rate, and no murmurs, lifts, or thrills. There is a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line. Lung examination reveals bibasilar crackles without wheezes or rhonchi. Abdominal examination shows obesity, soft and non-tender, with edema to the umbilicus. Extremities show no calf tenderness or pitting edema.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Renal ultrasound showed no signs of hydronephrosis.
- Social work note included counseling for coping with trauma and life changes, with a referral offered if receptive.
- Continued urine flow management.
- SPEP showed no specific abnormalities and was negative for Bence Jones proteins.
- UPEP revealed multiple protein bands with albumin predominating, but no monoclonal bands or Bence Jones proteins were detected.
- The patient has allergies to lisinopril, resulting in a rash and abdominal pain; kefzol (cefazolin sodium), causing hives; and sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), leading to hives, nausea, and facial swelling. Shellfish-derived substances also cause an allergic reaction.
- Infusions of calcium gluconate (CRRT) at 1 gram per hour and potassium chloride (CRRT) at 1 mEq per hour were administered.
- Other ICU medications were given, along with other medications.
- Medical and family history updates were made.
- Review of systems remained unchanged from admission except for certain noted changes.
- Flowsheet data showed vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, within normal ranges.
- Hemodynamic monitoring indicated adequate fluid balance.
- The patient's weight decreased from 93.6 kg at admission to 88.2 kg currently.
- Respiratory support was not required.
- ABG results were within normal limits.
- Physical examination findings were not assessed in several areas due to the patient's unresponsiveness.
- Lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- Assessment and plan included pain management, chronic renal failure, acute-on-chronic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and ulcerative colitis.
- ICU care involved nutrition, glycemic control, line management, dialysis catheter placement, arterial line placement, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and potential exposure to opportunistic pathogens in the ICU environment. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is crucial.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake of fluids, with a total in of 6,411 mL since 12 AM. This could potentially lead to fluid overload, especially considering the patient's chronic renal failure. Monitoring fluid status and adjusting fluid administration accordingly is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, with the lowest recorded value being 54/41 mmHg. Hypotension may indicate inadequate organ perfusion and should be promptly addressed to prevent further complications.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's abnormal kidney function tests suggest ongoing kidney dysfunction."

   DISPO: CCU for now pending diuresis with ultrafiltration
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication non-compliance and was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration. She is currently on day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis and her etiology of diastolic dysfunction remains unknown. There is evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria, but no significant change from the last echo, ruling out amyloidosis.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is currently experiencing loose stools. She is being treated with mesalamine 800mg TID and guaiac stools are being monitored.

Her renal function is compromised, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.4, increasing to 2.1 on admission and further worsening during diuresis. The patient has minimal urine output despite receiving lasix gtt and metolazone. She is also experiencing significant edema, and possible etiologies for her kidney disease include amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, minimal change disease, or other causes of glomerular nephrosis. The current creatinine level is at baseline at 1.3.

The patient has anemia with a Hct of 23, which is slowly trending down. This could be due to renal failure and possible GI loss given her prior history. Active T&S, monitoring of Hct"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication noncompliance and was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration. The patient has been unresponsive to intravenous diuretics and is now on day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis. The etiology of diastolic dysfunction is unknown, but there is a consideration of infiltrative disease, especially with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is currently experiencing loose stools. She has anemia with a Hct level of 23, which is likely due to renal failure and possible GI loss. The patient's cardiac status is complicated by atrial fibrillation, but she is not on anticoagulation due to a history of severe GI bleed. There is no history of coronary artery disease.

The patient's kidney function has deteriorated from a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.4 to 2.1 on admission, indicating acute on chronic kidney disease. Nephrotic range proteinuria and significant edema have been observed. No hyperlipidemia or monoclonal spike is present. Possible etiologies for the kidney disease include amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, minimal change disease, or other causes of glomerular nephrosis. Ren"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure, non-compliance with medication, and was admitted to the CCU for ultrafiltration. On day 2, she is still receiving ultrafiltration for diuresis. The etiology of her diastolic dysfunction is unknown, but there is evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria. She has a history of ulcerative colitis and is currently on mesalamine. Her renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in creatinine from 1.2-1.4 to 2.1. She also has anemia, likely due to a combination of renal failure and possible GI loss. The patient has multiple medical complications that require ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is severe and she is not responding to intravenous diuretics. She is undergoing ultrafiltration for diuresis, which may help remove excess fluid.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's renal function has worsened since admission, with an increase in creatinine levels. She has nephrotic range proteinuria and significant edema. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her CKD.
3. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication noncompliance and was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration. On day 2 of her admission, she is still experiencing acute decompensated diastolic heart failure, and her condition has not improved despite receiving intravenous diuretics. The etiology of her diastolic dysfunction is unknown, but there is a possibility of infiltrative disease, especially with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria. 

The patient also has a history of ulcerative colitis and is currently experiencing loose stools. Her hemoglobin level is low, likely due to a combination of anemia of chronic disease, renal failure, and possible gastrointestinal blood loss. She is being monitored for any signs of bleeding and her hemoglobin levels.

The patient's kidney function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level and nephrotic range proteinuria. She has minimal urine output despite receiving lasix and metolazone, and she has been started on ultrafiltration for volume removal. Further evaluation of her renal function is needed, including a renal ultrasound and avoiding nephrotoxins.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not on anticoagulation due to a severe gastrointestinal bleed. Her heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation, and she is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication non-compliance. She was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration. On day 2, she is still experiencing acute decompensated diastolic heart failure and is undergoing ultrafiltration for diuresis. The etiology of her diastolic dysfunction is unknown, and there is evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria. The patient also has a history of ulcerative colitis, anemia, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She has significant edema, hypotension, and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload can lead to further deterioration of her heart function, resulting in decreased cardiac output and poor perfusion.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease, nephrotic range proteinuria, and recent use of nephrotoxic medications increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and atrial fibrillation increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication non-compliance and was admitted to the CCU for ultrafiltration. She is currently on day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis. The etiology of her diastolic dysfunction is unknown and there is evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria. 

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is experiencing loose stools. She has anemia with a Hct of 23 and is likely a combination of anemia, renal failure, and possible GI loss given her prior history. She also has atrial fibrillation but is not on anti-coagulation due to a history of severe GI bleed. 

The patient has been aggressive and physically abusive towards the nursing staff, refusing general care and demonstrating splitting between healthcare providers. There is a consideration for a psych consult. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic heart failure: The patient's heart failure is not responding to intravenous diuretics, and she is now on day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis. It is important to continue monitoring her fluid balance and adjust diuretic doses as needed.
2. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.4, which increased to 2"

   ultrafiltration.
   # ACUTE DECOMPENSATED DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient not responding
   to intravenous diuretics, now day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis.
   Etiology of diastolic dysfunction unknown: consider infiltrative
   disease especially with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria (see
   below)
   -- continue UF
   -- restart diuretics  to improve urinary output, CVVH should be d/c
   today
   -- TTE repeated, no significant change from the last echo, no evidence
   of amyloidosis.
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD
   - ASA 81mg
   # RHYTHM: Pt with a-fib. Not on anti-coagulation given history of
   severe GI bleed.  Has significant bradycardia, although asymptomatic
   no confusion, dizziness, chest pain.  HR has improved now in 90s.
   - restart BB at low dose
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Pt with baseline 1.2-1.4. On
   admission 1.8 and increased to 2.1 with diuresis and poor forward
   flow.  However, patient only with minimal urine output with lasix gtt
   and metolazone. Started on UF for volume removal.  U/A with nephrotic
   range proteinuria and significant edema.  No hyperlipidemia and SPEP
   and UPEP without monoclonal spike.  Possible etiologies include
   amyloidosis (unlikely with negative UPEP), multiple myeloma, minimal
   change disease, other causes glomerular nephrosis. UOP minimal.
   -- f/u renal recs, possible biopsy

   refuses test by certain personel.  She also has numerous demands of her
   providers that are unreasonable.  She refuses to talk about
   preventative management fof her disease.  She has some version of sun
   downing at night, displaying physical aggression also.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She has been admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration due to medication non-compliance.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Acute decompensated diastolic heart failure: The patient is not responding to intravenous diuretics and is on day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis. The etiology of diastolic dysfunction is unknown, and infiltrative disease should be considered, especially with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria.

2. Coronaries: The patient has no history of CAD, and she is taking ASA 81 mg.

3. Rhythm: The patient has atrial fibrillation but is not on anticoagulation due to a history of severe gastrointestinal bleed. Her heart rate has improved to the 90s, but she should restart beta-blockers at a low dose and be monitored on telemetry.

4. Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.2-1.4, but it increased to 2.1 with diuresis and poor forward flow.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presented with decompensated heart failure due to medication noncompliance and was admitted to the CCU for initiation of ultrafiltration. 

The patient has been unresponsive to intravenous diuretics and is currently on day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis. The etiology of her diastolic dysfunction is unknown, but there is evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria. 

Her coronary history is negative for any previous coronary artery disease. 

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is experiencing loose stools. She is being continued on mesalamine 800mg TID. 

Her Hct level is 23, which is stable and likely a combination of anemia, renal failure, and possible GI loss given her prior history. 

She has agitation and behavioral problems, including splitting, refusing tests by certain personnel, and displaying physical aggression. A psych consult is being considered. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a malar erythematous rash, supple neck with jugular venous pressure at 15cm, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, bibasilar"
