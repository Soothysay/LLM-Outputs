   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with h/o amyloidosis who presents with
   hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  This was in the setting of
   starting Lisinopril yesterday and taking two doses over the past 24
   hours.  His BP did not improve with NS, but the patient is no longer
   symptomatic from his hypotension.  Per the patient, his SBP normally
   runs in the 80s-90s.  Hypotension is most likely [**12-27**] Lisinopril in the
   setting of amyloidosis (exposes subclinical autonomic neuropathy).
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril and Lasix
    - Continue 500 cc NS fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP > 60
    - Try to hold off on central line and Neosynepherine
   .
   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  He was started on Lisinopril night
   prior to admission by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 43**] the patient will reportedly be
   referred to [**Hospital1 475**] for further treatment of this condition.
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril
    - Consider Heme/Onc C/S in the am for possible chemotherapy v. SCT vs.
   transfer of care to [**Hospital1 475**]
    - Consider myocardial Bx
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  The patient has large bilateral pleural
   effusions, and had been scheduled for elective thoracentesis today.
   Spoke with pulm this afternoon, and they will take the patient for
   [**Female First Name (un) 231**] tomorrow as long as his pressure improves.
    - Will page IP this am, now seems stable for [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr on presentation is 1.9, which
   is increased from his baseline of 1.2 in [**4-2**].  This is most likely
   pre-renal as a result of low cardiac output; however, it may also be
   secondary to renal amyloid deposits.
    - FeNa suggestive of pre-renal.
    - Continue to bolus with 500 cc NS as needed.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of amyloidosis who presents with hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril use. The patient's blood pressure on admission was 74/51, and he experienced dizziness, nausea, and headache. His blood pressure did not improve with normal saline (NS) bolus, but the patient is no longer symptomatic from his hypotension. It is noted that the patient's blood pressure normally runs in the 80s-90s. Hypotension is most likely due to Lisinopril in the setting of amyloidosis, which exposes subclinical autonomic neuropathy.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: Continue to hold Lisinopril and Lasix. Continue 500 cc NS fluid boluses as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60. Try to hold off on central line and Neosynepherine.
2. Amyloidosis: The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis based on findings from transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He was started on Lisinopril the night prior to admission by his primary care physician (PCP). The patient will reportedly be referred to Hospital1 for further treatment of this condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of amyloidosis who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril treatment. He is experiencing dizziness, nausea, and headache. His blood pressure on admission was 74/51, but he is no longer symptomatic from his hypotension. The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 80s-90s. Hypotension is most likely due to Lisinopril in the setting of amyloidosis (exposes subclinical autonomic neuropathy). The patient has recently been diagnosed with amyloidosis and started on Lisinopril by his primary care physician. He will be referred to a hospital for further treatment of this condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and may result in organ damage or failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from his baseline, indicating possible acute renal failure. This can be pre-renal due to low cardiac output or secondary to renal amyloid deposits.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has large bilateral pleural effusions, which can compromise respiratory function and may require drainage.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient has recently been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis, which can lead to heart failure and other cardiac complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with h/o amyloidosis who presents with
   hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  This was in the setting of
   starting Lisinopril yesterday and taking two doses over the past 24
   hours.  His BP did not improve with NS, but the patient is no longer
   symptomatic from his hypotension.  Per the patient, his SBP normally
   runs in the 80s-90s.  Hypotension is most likely [**12-27**] Lisinopril in the
   setting of amyloidosis (exposes subclinical autonomic neuropathy).
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril and Lasix
    - Continue 500 cc NS fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP > 60
    - Try to hold off on central line and Neosynepherine
   .
   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  He was started on Lisinopril night
   prior to admission by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 43**] the patient will reportedly be
   referred to [**Hospital1 475**] for further treatment of this condition.
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril
    - Consider Heme/Onc C/S in the am for possible chemotherapy v. SCT vs.
   transfer of care to [**Hospital1 475**]
    - Consider myocardial Bx
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  The patient has large bilateral pleural
   effusions, and had been scheduled for elective thoracentesis today.
   Spoke with pulm this afternoon, and they will take the patient for
   [**Female First Name (un) 231**] tomorrow as long as his pressure improves.
    - Will page IP this am, now seems stable for [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr on presentation is 1.9, which
   is increased from his baseline of 1.2 in [**4-2**].  This is most likely
   pre-renal as a result of low cardiac output; however, it may also be
   secondary to renal amyloid deposits.
    - FeNa suggestive of pre-renal.
    - Continue to bolus with 500 cc NS as needed.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP

The patient's blood pressure on admission was 74/51, and he was experiencing dizziness, nausea, and headache. His blood pressure did not improve with normal saline (NS) bolus, but the patient is no longer symptomatic from his hypotension.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with h/o amyloidosis who presents with
   hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril.
   .
   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  Yesterday a fat pad biopsy and fat
   pad aspirate were done in search of a definitive tissue diagnosis.  The
   patient has yet to define clear goals of care and is awaiting
   acceptance into the BU [**Hospital 7063**] clinic.
    - Family meeting today to discuss diagnosis, prognosis and plan.
   Should involve primary team, heme/onc, social work.  Need to establish
   plan of care before discharge.
   - contact [**Hospital1 475**]
    - f/u fat pad biopsy, aspirate and UPEP
    - f/u factor X, beta2-microglobulin per heme-onc
    - appreciate heme-onc recs.
   - skeletal survey and abd U/S wet-reads normal but f/u final reports
    - If fat pad biopsy inconclusive, may require bone marrow biopsy.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  Initial symptomatic
   hypotension most likely due to Lisinopril.  Per the patient, his SBP
   normally runs in the 80s-90s, yesterday was able to ambulate with SBP
   in the high 70s and 80s.
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   - If patient remains asymptomatic, no intervention necessary.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  Thoracentesis done yesterday with symptomatic
   improvement per patient.  All effusions have been transudates, meaning
   cause is restrictive cardiomyopathy and will most likely recur.
   However, permanent cath would be last resort per IP.
   - CXR yest showed improvement of right effusion post-tap; today CXR
   shows bilat effusions
    - Monitor dyspnea and morning CXR; consider re-tap if stays O/N
   tonight
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr on presentation is 1.9, which
   is increased from his baseline of 1.2 in [**4-2**], increased to 2.2 and now
   appears to be trending down.  Ddx is pre-renal due to hypotension,
   amyloid renal disease and post-renal due to BPH.  FE Urea of 16
   suggestive of pre-renal.
    - Continue to bolus with 500 cc NS as needed.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of amyloidosis.
- He presented with hypotension and was found to have pleural effusions, which were tapped and drained 1500ccs of fluid.
- The gram stain of the pleural fluid showed PMNs but no bacteria.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from 75-85 mmHg systolic and 49-74 mmHg diastolic.
- He has been given a 500cc bolus of normal saline overnight.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with h/o amyloidosis who presents with
   hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril.
   .
   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  Yesterday a fat pad biopsy and fat
   pad aspirate were done in search of a definitive tissue diagnosis.  The
   patient has yet to define clear goals of care and is awaiting
   acceptance into the BU [**Hospital 7063**] clinic.
    - Family meeting today to discuss diagnosis, prognosis and plan.
   Should involve primary team, heme/onc, social work, possibly palliative
   care.  Need to establish plan of care before discharge.
    - f/u fat pad biopsy, aspirate and UPEP
    - appreciate heme-onc recs.
    - If fat pad biopsy inconclusive, may require bone marrow biopsy.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  Initial symptomatic
   hypotension most likely due to Lisinopril.  Per the patient, his SBP
   normally runs in the 80s-90s, yesterday was able to ambulate with SBP
   in the high 70s and 80s.
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril and Lasix
    - Continue 500 cc NS fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP > 60
    - If patient remains asymptomatic, no intervention necessary.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  Thoracentesis done yesterday with symptomatic
   improvement per patient.  All effusions have been transudates, meaning
   cause is restrictive cardiomyopathy and will most likely recur.
   However, permanent cath would be last resort per IP.
    - Monitor dyspnea and morning CXR.
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr on presentation is 1.9, which
   is increased from his baseline of 1.2 in [**4-2**], increased to 2.2 and now
   appears to be trending down.  Ddx is pre-renal due to hypotension vs
   amyloid renal disease.
    - FE Urea of 16 suggestive of pre-renal.

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of amyloidosis who presents with hypotension. He has been diagnosed with amyloidosis based on findings from a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and cardiac MRI. A fat pad biopsy and fat pad aspirate were performed to confirm the diagnosis, but the results are still pending. The patient is currently awaiting acceptance into the BU [**Hospital 7063**] clinic and has not yet defined clear goals of care.

The patient's blood pressure on admission was 74/51, and he experienced dizziness, nausea, and headache. Initial symptomatic hypotension was likely due to Lisinopril. His systolic blood pressure normally runs in the 80s-90s, and yesterday he was able to ambulate with a systolic blood pressure in the high 70s and 80s.

The patient underwent a pleurocentesis yesterday, which provided symptomatic improvement. All effusions have been transudates, meaning the cause is restrictive cardiomyopathy and will most likely recur. However, permanent catheter placement would be a last resort, according to the interventional radiologist (IP).

The patient's creatinine (Cr) on presentation is 1.9, which is increased from his baseline of 1.2 in [**4-2**]. The Cr level increased to 2.2 and now appears to be trending down. The differential diagnosis includes"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with h/o amyloidosis who presents with
   hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril.

   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  Yesterday a fat pad biopsy and fat
   pad aspirate were done in search of a definitive tissue diagnosis.  The
   patient has yet to define clear goals of care and is awaiting
   acceptance into the BU [**Hospital 7063**] clinic.
    - Family meeting today to discuss diagnosis, prognosis and plan.
   Should involve primary team, heme/onc, social work, possibly palliative
   care.  Need to establish plan of care before discharge.
    - f/u fat pad biopsy, aspirate and UPEP
    - f/u BNP and factor X per heme-onc
    - appreciate heme-onc recs.
    - If fat pad biopsy inconclusive, may require bone marrow biopsy.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  Initial symptomatic
   hypotension most likely due to Lisinopril.  Per the patient, his SBP
   normally runs in the 80s-90s, yesterday was able to ambulate with SBP
   in the high 70s and 80s.
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril and Lasix
    - Continue 500 cc NS fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP > 60
    - If patient remains asymptomatic, no intervention necessary.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  Thoracentesis done yesterday with symptomatic
   improvement per patient.  All effusions have been transudates, meaning
   cause is restrictive cardiomyopathy and will most likely recur.
   However, permanent cath would be last resort per IP.
    - Monitor dyspnea and morning CXR.
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr on presentation is 1.9, which
   is increased from his baseline of 1.2 in [**4-2**], increased to 2.2 and now
   appears to be trending down.  Ddx is pre-renal due to hypotension,
   amyloid renal disease and post-renal due to BPH.  FE Urea of 16
   suggestive of pre-renal.
    - Continue to bolus with 500 cc NS as needed.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of amyloidosis presenting with hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril. The patient has undergone several diagnostic procedures, including pleurocentesis, fat pad biopsy, and aspiration. He has also been evaluated by hematology-oncology and received recommendations for further testing.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, which is being managed with fluid boluses and holding Lisinopril and Lasix. The patient's blood pressure is running in the 80s-90s, and he is able to ambulate without difficulty. There are concerns about recurrent pleural effusions, which have been transudates and may require ongoing monitoring.

The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level from his baseline. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia due to hypotension, amyloid renal disease, and post-renal causes related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The plan is to continue fluid resuscitation and monitor the patient's renal function.

The patient is currently receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pain management, bowel regimen, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment at either Hospital 1 or staying here for ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, recurrent pleural effusions, and further deterioration of cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of amyloidosis presenting with hypotension and recent diagnosis of amyloidosis. The patient underwent pleurocentesis, fat pad biopsy, and aspirate to confirm the diagnosis. The patient's blood pressure has been low but asymptomatic, and he is being monitored closely. The patient also has pleural effusions, which were drained yesterday with improvement. He has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. The patient is awaiting acceptance into the amyloidosis clinic at Hospital 475 and is awaiting a decision on whether to treat here or there. A family meeting has been planned to discuss the diagnosis, prognosis, and plan of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, and there is a concern for ongoing hypotension, which can lead to inadequate perfusion and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and fluid boluses as needed are being implemented.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has recurrent pleural effusions, which are likely due to restrictive cardiomyopathy associated with amyloidosis. Recurrence of effusions may require repeat thoracentesis or consideration of a permanent pleural catheter.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia due to hypotension, amyloid renal disease, and post-renal obstruction due to benign pro"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with recent dx of cardiac amyloidosis (on
   TTE, cardiac MRI, EKG) who presents with hypotension in the setting of
   Lisinopril 2.5mg X2
   .
   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  Fat pad biopsy and fat pad aspirate
   were done on [**5-25**] for definitive tissue diagnosis; results were rushed,
   still pending. Bone marrow biopsy done in hopes of ensuring good tissue
   sampling. Family meeting held w/ CCU, H/O and social work to discuss
   diagnosis and plan yesterday.
   - Pt has appointment at [**Hospital1 475**] amyloid clinic for Monday, [**2129-5-30**] at 7:45am
    - f/u fat pad biopsy, aspirate and bone marrow biopsy
    - f/u UPEP, beta2-microglobulin per heme-onc
    - appreciate heme-onc recs.
   - skeletal survey and abd U/S final reads normal
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  Initial symptomatic
   hypotension most likely due to Lisinopril.  Per the patient, his SBP
   normally runs in the 80s-90s, yesterday was able to ambulate with SBP
   in the high 70s and 80s w/ mild tachycardia (HR 90s)
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril
    - If patient remains asymptomatic, no intervention necessary.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  Thoracentesis done [**2129-5-25**] with symptomatic
   improvement per patient.  All effusions have been transudates, meaning
   cause is restrictive cardiomyopathy and will most likely recur.
   However, permanent cath would be last resort per IP.
   - CXR on [**5-25**] after tap showed improvement of right effusion post-tap;
   yesterday
s CXR suggests reaccumulation of b/l effusions
   - b/c of diastolic dysfunction will need a low dose of lasix to prevent
   overload.  Will start 20mg PO Qdaily
    - Monitor dyspnea; consider re-tap if stays O/N tonight
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr now 1.8, which is increased
   from his baseline of 1.2 in 5/0; Cr had increased to 2.2 this admission
   but now appears to be trending down.  Ddx is pre-renal due to
   hypotension, amyloid renal disease and post-renal due to BPH.  FE Urea
   of 16 suggestive of pre-renal.
    - Continue to bolus with 250cc NS as needed.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with recent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, presenting with hypotension and other symptoms. He has had several medical interventions, including a bone marrow biopsy, fat pad biopsy, and aspiration, as well as a thoracentesis. His blood pressure is consistently low, and he has experienced episodes of abdominal pain. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has pleural effusions that have been managed with thoracentesis. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure indicates potential hypotension, which may be related to his cardiac amyloidosis or the medication Lisinopril. It is important to continue holding Lisinopril and monitor the patient's blood pressure closely.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal, amyloid renal disease, and post-renal causes. It is crucial to continue fluid resuscitation and monitor renal function closely.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has recurrent pleural effusions, which have been managed with thoracentesis. Monitoring for signs of reaccumulation and considering repeat thoracentesis if necessary is important.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's episodes of abdominal pain may indicate potential gastrointestinal complications or side effects of medications. Further evaluation and management are needed to"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with recent dx of cardiac amyloidosis (on
   TTE, cardiac MRI, EKG) who presents with hypotension in the setting of
   Lisinopril 2.5mg X2
   .
   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  Fat pad biopsy and fat pad aspirate
   were done on [**5-25**] for definitive tissue diagnosis; results were rushed,
   still pending. Bone marrow biopsy done in hopes of ensuring good tissue
   sampling. Family meeting held w/ CCU, H/O and social work to discuss
   diagnosis and plan yesterday.
   - Pt has appointment at [**Hospital1 475**] amyloid clinic for Monday, [**2129-5-30**] at 7:45am
    - f/u fat pad biopsy, aspirate and bone marrow biopsy
    - f/u UPEP, beta2-microglobulin per heme-onc
    - appreciate heme-onc recs.
   - skeletal survey and abd U/S final reads normal
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  Initial symptomatic
   hypotension most likely due to Lisinopril.  Per the patient, his SBP
   normally runs in the 80s-90s, yesterday was able to ambulate with SBP
   in the high 70s and 80s w/ mild tachycardia (HR 90s)
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril
    - If patient remains asymptomatic, no intervention necessary.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  Thoracentesis done [**2129-5-25**] with symptomatic
   improvement per patient.  All effusions have been transudates, meaning
   cause is restrictive cardiomyopathy and will most likely recur.
   However, permanent cath would be last resort per IP.
   - CXR on [**5-25**] after tap showed improvement of right effusion post-tap;
   yesterday
s CXR suggests reaccumulation of b/l effusions
   - b/c of diastolic dysfunction will need a low dose of lasix to prevent
   overload.  Will start 20mg PO Qdaily
    - Monitor dyspnea; consider re-tap if stays O/N tonight
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr now 1.8, which is increased
   from his baseline of 1.2 in 5/0; Cr had increased to 2.2 this admission
   but now appears to be trending down.  Ddx is pre-renal due to
   hypotension, amyloid renal disease and post-renal due to BPH.  FE Urea
   of 16 suggestive of pre-renal.
    - Continue to bolus with 250cc NS as needed.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with recent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis who presents with hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril use. The patient's blood pressure on admission was 74/51, and he experienced dizziness, nausea, and headache. Initial symptomatic hypotension was most likely due to Lisinopril. The patient's baseline blood pressure ranges from the 80s to 90s.

The patient has an upcoming appointment at Hospital1-475 amyloid clinic for Monday, 5/30, at 7:45 AM. The plan is to follow up with fat pad biopsy, aspirate, and bone marrow biopsy. Additionally, they will be monitoring UPEP and beta-2 microglobulin per heme-onc.

The patient's skeletal survey and abdominal ultrasound are normal. He has a history of cardiac amyloidosis, and his current medications include Morphine Sulfate, Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), and Lorazepam (Ativan).

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit, and elevated platelet count. His creatinine levels have been trending down, indicating improvement in renal function. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient has a history of pleural effusions, which were found to be transudates. Thoracentesis was performed on 5/25 with symptomatic improvement. However,"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 66-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.
- He presented with hypotension and was found to have pleural effusions, which were aspirated and improved symptomatically.
- A bone marrow biopsy was performed to ensure good tissue sampling for a definitive diagnosis.
- The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 74/51 to 83/56 mmHg.
- He has experienced episodes of crampy abdominal pain, but it resolved on its own.
- The patient's renal function has been declining, with a creatinine level of 1.8, which is increased from his baseline of 1.2 in 5/0.
- The patient's pleural effusions reaccumulated, and he is being monitored for dyspnea.
- The patient is scheduled to attend an appointment at Hospital1 475 amyloid clinic on Monday at 7:45 AM.
- The patient will be discharged home today to receive outpatient treatment at Hospital1 475.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's declining renal function, indicated by an increase in creatinine levels from 1.2 to 1.8, suggests acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal causes (hypotension), amyloid renal disease, or post-renal causes (benign prostatic hyperplasia)."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with recent dx of cardiac amyloidosis (on
   TTE, cardiac MRI, EKG) who presents with hypotension in the setting of
   Lisinopril 2.5mg X2
   .
   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  Fat pad biopsy and fat pad aspirate
   were done on [**5-25**] for definitive tissue diagnosis; results were rushed,
   still pending. Bone marrow biopsy done in hopes of ensuring good tissue
   sampling. Family meeting held w/ CCU, H/O and social work to discuss
   diagnosis and plan yesterday.
   - Pt has appointment at [**Hospital1 475**] amyloid clinic for Monday, [**2129-5-30**] at 7:45am
    - f/u fat pad biopsy, aspirate and bone marrow biopsy
    - f/u UPEP, beta2-microglobulin per heme-onc
    - appreciate heme-onc recs.
   - skeletal survey and abd U/S final reads normal
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  Initial symptomatic
   hypotension most likely due to Lisinopril.  Per the patient, his SBP
   normally runs in the 80s-90s, yesterday was able to ambulate with SBP
   in the high 70s and 80s w/ mild tachycardia (HR 90s)
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   - If patient remains asymptomatic, no intervention necessary.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  Thoracentesis done [**2129-5-25**] with symptomatic
   improvement per patient.  All effusions have been transudates, meaning
   cause is restrictive cardiomyopathy and will most likely recur.
   However, permanent cath would be last resort per IP.
   - CXR on [**5-25**] after tap showed improvement of right effusion post-tap;
   yesterday
s CXR suggests reaccumulation of b/l effusions
    - Monitor dyspnea; consider re-tap if stays O/N tonight
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr now 1.8, which is increased
   from his baseline of 1.2 in 5/0; Cr had increased to 2.2 this admission
   but now appears to be trending down.  Ddx is pre-renal due to
   hypotension, amyloid renal disease and post-renal due to BPH.  FE Urea
   of 16 suggestive of pre-renal.
    - Continue to bolus with 250cc NS as needed.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with recent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis who presents with hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril use. He also has a history of pleural effusions, acute renal failure, and chronic renal disease. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/56 mmHg to 94/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is currently on prophylactic heparin for DVT, colace for bowel care, and morphine IV for pain management.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, there is a risk of further cardiac dysfunction or arrhythmias.

2. Renal complications: The patient has a history of acute renal failure and chronic renal disease. There is a risk of worsening renal function or the development of end-stage renal disease.

3. Pulmonary complications: The patient's pleural effusions may recur, leading to respiratory distress or infection.

4. Infection: As the patient is in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

5. Bleeding complications: Due to the use of anticoagulant therapy (heparin), there is a"
