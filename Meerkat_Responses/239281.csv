","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema who is on home oxygen. He was admitted after experiencing a syncopal episode and is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and management of progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/72 mmHg to 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. His temperature is within normal range at 36.6°C (97.8°F). 

The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at 15L with 60% FiO2. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2 of 149 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 80% on 80% FiO2. His PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 248, which reflects severely impaired gas exchange.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well but has mild labored breathing. His neck veins are difficult to assess due to his habitus. He has regular tachycardia with normal S1 and loud P2, bibasilar dry crackles in his lungs, a soft abdomen, warm dry"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) and emphysema who is experiencing dyspnea and hypoxemia. He has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of his condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/72 to 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be caused by an acute exacerbation of IPF or another underlying condition. The low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates severely impaired gas exchange. Supplemental oxygen is being provided to maintain an oxygen saturation above 92%. Steroids have been avoided due to the patient's poor response in the past, and the clinical scenario does not suggest an inflammatory process.

2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a known history of pulmonary hypertension, which can contribute to hypoxemia. Further evaluation and management are planned, including a right heart catheterization (RHC) to assess the severity of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular function.

3. Syncope: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema who is on home oxygen. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a syncopal episode and is currently in the ICU due to progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 156/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula with 60% FiO2 and has an ABG showing a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 248. The physical examination reveals bibasilar dry crackles and no wheezing or rhonchi. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, but normal electrolyte levels. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease (CKD), ethanol abuse, and suspected pulmonary hypertension (PH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of IPF: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxemia could be due to an acute worsening of his underlying IPF. Close monitoring and treatment with bronchodilators and corticosteroids may be necessary.
2. Worsening of pulmonary hypertension: The patient's history of PH and syncopal episode raises concern for potential worsening of this"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) and emphysema, complicated by pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode and presented with dyspnea and hypoxemia. The patient is currently on home oxygen and is known to have poor response to steroids. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 156/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and elevated potassium and magnesium levels. His kidney function tests are within normal range, but he has impaired liver function. The patient's ECG does not show evidence of ischemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of IPF: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxemia could be due to an acute worsening of his underlying lung disease, IPF. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is necessary.
2. Worsening pulmonary hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart strain and failure. Right heart catheterization is planned to evaluate the severity of pulmonary hypertension and assess the need for specific therapies such as PDE5 inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonists.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema, complicated by pulmonary hypertension, who was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of hypoxemia. The patient presented with progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week. The initial assessment suggests an acute exacerbation of IPF, with no evidence of underlying infection or left heart failure. The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 saturation above 92%. Steroids have been avoided due to the patient's poor response in the past and the current clinical scenario unlikely to represent an inflammatory process. The patient's medical history includes suspected pulmonary embolism, syncope, alcohol abuse, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment for various conditions, including hypoxemia, potential pulmonary embolism, and chronic kidney disease. Potential complications that can arise include further deterioration of lung function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, worsening of pulmonary hypertension, and progression of chronic kidney disease."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema complicated by pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode and is being evaluated for further management of hypoxemia. The patient's symptoms include progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week. There is no evidence of underlying infection or left heart failure.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Hypoxemia - suspected acute exacerbation of IPF, with supplemental O2 to maintain O2 saturation above 92%. Steroids are avoided due to poor response in the past and the lack of an inflammatory process.
2. Syncope - most likely due to hypoxemia or worsening pulmonary hypertension. Other potential etiologies include pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac ischemia, or arrhythmia.
3. ETOH abuse - Valium CIWA, MVI, folate, thiamine.
4. CKD - Creatinine likely at baseline. Restart ACEi, lasix.
5. Right heart catheterization (RHC) is planned on 10/2 to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and consider PDE5 inhibitor or endothelin receptor antagonist therapy.
6. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is ordered to evaluate the degree of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular function.

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   (Above note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2956**].)
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2956**], whose note above reflects
   my input.  Says his dyspnea feels substantially better with the
   oxygen.  On exam, regular with murmur.  Basilar crackles.  Labs, meds,
   imaging all reviewed.  61 y/o man with IPF and emphysema, as well as
   pulmonary hypertension.  Admitted with syncope, hypoxemia, and resp
   distress.  We will continue oxygen, NAC, symbicort, spiriva, and
   bronchodilators.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104**] is in covering the MICU tonight and is
   Mr. [**Known lastname **]
s primary pulmonologist and it makes sense for him to choose
   next course of therapy.  As described above, RHC with sildenafil,
   high-res CT, etc., all reasonable approaches.  Other issues as
   described above.
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) and emphysema, complicated by pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode and worsening hypoxemia. The patient has been progressively experiencing shortness of breath over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week. There is no evidence of underlying infection or left heart failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia - suspected acute exacerbation of IPF, with supplemental O2 to maintain O2 saturation above 92%.
2. Avoidance of steroids due to poor response in the past and current clinical scenario unlikely to represent an inflammatory process.
3. Continue NAc, symbicort, spiriva, nebs prn (as needed).
4. Consult primary pulmonologist for further management, including non-contrast HRCT chest and right heart catheterization (RHC) with sildenafil.
5. Consider PDE5 inhibitor or endothelin receptor antagonist therapy for pulmonary hypertension pending RHC results.
6. TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) to evaluate degree of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular function.

2. Syncope - most likely due to hypoxemia or worsening pulmonary hypertension. Other potential etiologies include pulmonary embolism, cardiac ischemia, and arrhythmia.
   - Ruling out myocardial infarction with serial cardiac biomarkers.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), specifically IPF and emphysema, as well as pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode and worsening hypoxemia. The patient's condition is being evaluated for potential acute exacerbation of IPF, ruling out underlying infection or left heart failure. He is currently on supplemental oxygen, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and nebulized bronchodilators as needed. The primary pulmonologist is considering a CT pulmonary angiography (PE-CT) but is concerned about the contrast load due to the patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD). They also plan to discuss a non-contrast high-resolution CT (HRCT) chest with another doctor tonight and proceed with a right heart catheterization (RHC) on [**10-2**]. The patient is also being considered for phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor or endothelin receptor antagonist therapy for pulmonary hypertension, pending RHC results. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed to evaluate the degree of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular function. The patient's syncope is believed to be due to hypoxemia or worsening pulmonary hypertension, and other potential causes such as pulmonary embolism, cardiac ischemia, or arrhythmia are also being considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema, complicated by pulmonary hypertension. He is on home oxygen and was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode. The patient's symptoms include progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week. His current condition is characterized by hypoxemia, requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 saturation above 92%. The primary pulmonologist recommends a computed tomography angiography (CTA) first to exclude reversible causes, followed by a right heart catheterization (RHC) if negative. The patient's other medical conditions include suspected acute exacerbation of IPF, syncope, ETOH abuse, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of IPF: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and hypoxemia may indicate an acute exacerbation of his underlying interstitial lung disease. If left untreated, this could lead to further respiratory decline and potentially respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen due to his underlying lung diseases. If not managed appropriately, this could result in right heart strain or failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's immobility in the ICU and his risk factors for thromb"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema who has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of hypoxemia following a syncopal episode. The patient's chief complaint is worsening shortness of breath (SOB) over the past few months with an acute worsening over the past week.

The patient has been weaned off oxygen as tolerated and is currently on supplemental oxygen to maintain an O2 saturation above 92%. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 109 bpm with a sinus tachycardia rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 133/92 mmHg to 149/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and an SpO2 of 89%.

The physical examination reveals crackles in the right lung bases and the presence of bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count of 218 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 36.9 g/dL, and creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL indicating some degree of kidney dysfunction. Other notable lab results include a troponin-T level below 0.01, lactic acid level of 2.1 mmol/L, calcium level of 8.6 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 2.8 mg/dL.

The assessment and plan include hypoxemia, syncope, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient is suspected to have an acute exacerbation of IPF with no evidence of underlying infection or left heart failure. Steroids are avoided due to the patient's poor response in the past. The primary pulmonologist is considering a pulmonary embolism computed tomography (PE-CT) but is concerned about the contrast load given the patient's CKD. They also plan to discuss a non-contrast high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest with a doctor tonight.

For the syncope episode, potential etiologies include hypoxemia or worsening pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), as well as pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac ischemia, or arrhythmia. The patient's CKD is noted with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, and it is mentioned that the creatinine is likely at baseline. The restart of ACE inhibitors and lasix is planned.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on full diet, and glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has two IV lines, one 18-gauge and one 20-gauge, and is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with subcutaneous low-molecular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema, who is on home oxygen. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode for further evaluation and management of hypoxemia. The patient's shortness of breath (SOB) has been progressively worsening over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week. The assessment suggests that the patient's hypoxemia is likely due to an acute exacerbation of IPF, with no evidence of underlying infection or left heart failure. The plan includes providing supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 saturation above 92%, avoiding steroids due to poor response in the past, continuing N-acetylcysteine (NAC), symbicort, spiriva, and nebs as needed. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) is planned today to rule out an acute event superimposed upon pulmonary fibrosis, and right heart catheterization (RHC) may be considered in the future to evaluate for pulmonary hypertension and assess the possibility of starting phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor or endothelin receptor antagonist therapy. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will also be performed to evaluate the degree of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular function. Dr. [Last Name (Title)] will discuss the patient's transplant status today. The patient's syncope is most likely due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema, who is on home oxygen. He was admitted after experiencing a syncopal episode and presented with progressively worsening shortness of breath (SOB) over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/92 to 149/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals crackles in the right lung bases and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, platelet count of 218 K/uL, blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL, and sodium level of 140 mEq/L. The creatinine level is noted as likely at baseline, and other lab values such as troponin T, CK, CKMB, PT/PTT/INR, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxemia, suspected acute exacerbation of IPF with no evidence of underlying infection or left heart failure. The plan involves maintaining oxygen saturation above 92% with supplemental"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with syncope and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to NSAIDs and antibiotics. Upon admission, the patient was found to have severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, and new diffuse ground-glass opacities in the presence of significant enlargement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. This is concerning for acute progression of IPF/UIP. The patient's blood pressure has been elevated overnight and amlodipine was started. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (ILD), specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).
2. Pulmonary arterial hypertension leading to right heart strain or failure.
3. Hypertension that may require further management.
4. Potential allergy to certain medications, such as NSAIDs and antibiotics.
5. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Risk of stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization.
8. Ineffective coping mechanisms, which may contribute to the patient's overall condition.

Note: These potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and emphysema, complicated by pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU following a syncopal episode for further evaluation and management of hypoxemia. The patient has been experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxemia - suspected acute exacerbation of IPF as no evidence of underlying infection or left heart failure. The patient is on supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 saturation above 92%. Steroids are being avoided due to poor response in the past and the current clinical scenario unlikely to represent an inflammatory process.
2. Syncope - most likely due to hypoxemia or worsening pulmonary hypertension. Other potential etiologies include pulmonary embolism, cardiac ischemia, or arrhythmia. The patient's myocardial infarction has been ruled out with serial cardiac biomarkers. Telemetry, CTA, and TTE are planned to further evaluate the cause.
3. ETOH abuse - the patient's CIWA is outside the window of withdrawal, so it will be discontinued. Multivitamins (MVI), folate, and thiamine will be restarted.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) - the patient's creatinine level is likely at baseline. ACEi and lasix will"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema, complicated by pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode and for further evaluation and management of hypoxemia. 

The patient's symptoms include progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week. The chest X-ray showed no pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or aneurysm, but there was significant progression of the predominantly subpleural abnormality associated with traction bronchiectasis, reticulation, and new diffuse ground-glass opacities in the presence of significant enlargement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, which is concerning for an acute progression of IPF/UIP. 

The echocardiogram revealed severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis suggestive of a primary pulmonary process. 

The patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI. The patient's blood pressure has been hypertensive, with readings in the 150s/100s, and amlodipine was started to manage this. 

The patient has allergies to Ibuprofen and NSAIDs. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema, complicated by pulmonary hypertension. He was transferred from an outside hospital due to a syncopal episode and worsening hypoxemia. The patient's symptoms include progressive shortness of breath over the past few months, with an acute worsening over the past week. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 140/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation and right lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging reveals no pulmonary embolism but significant progression of subpleural infiltrates associated with traction bronchiectasis, reticulation, and new diffuse ground-glass opacities, which are concerning for acute progression of IPF-UIP. The assessment and plan include treatment for hypoxemia, suspected acute exacerbation of IPF, syncope, chronic kidney disease, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor once stabilized.
