","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents with a one-month history of worsening dyspnea on exertion. She was found unresponsive and intubated in the emergency room. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely a combination of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and possibly pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, and possible bronchospasm with wheezing on exam. There are no signs of pulmonary infection at this time. The patient is grossly volume overloaded with anasarca in her legs and some in her belly. She has been started on a short steroid course of prednisone for possible element of bronchospasm and will continue mechanical ventilation to optimize ABG. An echocardiogram will be obtained to assess for pulmonary hypertension and RV strain. Antibiotics will not be continued as there are no signs of infection. Sedation with fentanyl and versed will be used as tolerated. The patient's type II diabetes will be managed with regular insulin sliding scale. Blood pressures in the 100s on sedation will be monitored and home antihypertensives will be held while on sedation. The patient will start tube feeds for nutrition. Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin will be administered, and Pepcid will be given. Peripheral IV access will be established, and a PICC placement may"

   Assessment and Plan
   61-year-old with respiratory failure in the context of likely
   obesity/hypoventilation syndrome.  There is no clear evidence of
   infection at present.  There may be right heart failure.
   Today we will plan:
          Echo today (evaluate pulmonary hyptertension)
          Diuresis goal about -2L (Lasix gtt)
          Begin conversion toward bolus sedation
          Continue steroids and bronchodilators for possible
   bronchospasm.  No clear evidence for COPD, so holding off on ABX for
   now.
          Meticulous observation for possible infections, though none
   apparent at present

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old with respiratory failure, likely due to obesity/hypoventilation syndrome. The patient is intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support. There are no clear signs of infection at present, but there may be right heart failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 to 139/79 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving several medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and Lasix.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, sodium level of 110 mg/dL, glucose level of 159 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals symmetric small pupils, distant heart sounds, wheezes, an obese abdomen with white stuff in the stomach, and lower extremity edema.

The patient's plan for today includes an echocardiogram to evaluate for pulmonary hypertension, diuresis goal of -2L with Lasix, conversion toward bolus sedation, continuation of steroids and bronchodil"

   of the cardiac silhouette is also more pronounced, but there is no
   pulmonary edema.
   [**11-11**] Echo
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac
   index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is
   dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. No aortic stenosis or regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. Right ventricular
   cavity enlargement with low normal free wall motion. Mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of
   [**2173-1-27**], mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and right
   ventricular cavity enlargement are now apparent. The other findings are
   similar.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 ACIDOSIS, RESPIRATORY
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion.
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Likely combination
   of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and possibly pulmonary
   hypertension, diastolic heart failure, possible bronchospasm with
   wheezing on exam.  She does not appear to have signs of pulmonary
   infection at this time.  Likely volume overloaded with gross anasarca
   in her legs and some in her belly.  Started on short steroid course
   Prednisone for possible element of bronchospasm.
   CXR final read yesterday without evidence of pulm edema, and echo with
   evidence of R heart strain and mild pulm art HTN.
   -Today is day [**3-7**] for short steroid course
   - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
   - Will give Lasix 40mg IV this am, f/u UOP later this pm, and consider
   giving more diuresis
   - Get repeat CXR this am and f/u
   - sedation with fentanyl and versed as tolerated
   Questionable developing PNA on CXR
   - With WBC's trending up, but still not elevated grossly and no fevers
   through admission
   - Will continue to hold off on ABx for now
   Type II Diabetes:
   - Blood sugars through yesterday in the 100's
   - regular insulin sliding scale, continue as is
   Hypertension: Blood pressures in the 100s on sedation.
   - hold home antihypertensives while on sedation
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO, will start tube feeds for
   nutrition
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, start Pepcid
   Access: peripherals
 Will likely need PICC placement

   Imaging: [**11-11**] CTA
   Markedly limited study due to patient body habitus and suboptimal pulm
   arterial contrast opacification. Cannot exclude small pulmonary emboli,
   particularly within left lower lobe segmental artery (3, 53-54). No
   large
   central PE. Massive cardiomegaly. Main pulmonary artery enlargement up
   to 3.3
   cm. Right hilar lymph node measuring up to 1.3 cm. Bilateral
   atelectasis and
   tiny b/l effusions. Left thyroid nodule. Intraabdominal ascites.
   [**11-11**] CXR final read
   Consolidation at the base of the left lung, which progressed on
   [**11-10**] is
   concerning for pneumonia. Upper lungs are clear. ET tube in standard
   placement, nasogastric tube passes as well into the stomach. Small
   right
   pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis have worsened. Upper lungs
   clear. Mediastinal vascular engorgement is mild suggesting elevated
   central venous pressure or semi-erect positioning. Moderate enlargement
   of the cardiac silhouette is also more pronounced, but there is no
   pulmonary edema.
   [**11-11**] Echo
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac
   index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is
   dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. No aortic stenosis or regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. Right ventricular
   cavity enlargement with low normal free wall motion. Mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of
   [**2173-1-27**], mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and right
   ventricular cavity enlargement are now apparent. The other findings are
   similar.

   Imaging: ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild

   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right

   function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic stenosis or regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. Right ventricular

   Assessment and Plan
   61-year-old woman with respiratory failure.  The etiology of this is
   not completely clear.  Most likely is volume overload (60# weight gain
   per family) from diastolic or right heart failure.  Pulmonary
   hypertension may contribute.  We are also treating for some component
   of asthma. There is no evidence of infection (no fever, no
   leucocytosis, no bandemia).  Today we will diurese and attempt again to
   get about 2L negative.  We will reculture sputum (though again has no
   clear evidence of infection).  Wean steroids.  If we do not make
   progress, may be reasonable to consider right heart cath to eval
   pulmonary hypertension but the best balance of risks and benefits seems
   to be a trial of diuresis first.  Discussed with daughter at bedside.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman who is currently in respiratory failure. The etiology of her respiratory failure is not completely clear, but it is likely due to volume overload from diastolic or right heart failure, with possible pulmonary hypertension contributing as well. 

The patient's medical history includes obesity, hypertension, and asthma. Her vital signs show borderline hypotension with a blood pressure of 133/60 mmHg, sinus rhythm, and a heart rate of 90 bpm. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, troponin T, and electrolytes. However, her blood glucose level is elevated at 226 mg/dL. The imaging report shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function, right ventricular cavity enlargement with borderline normal free wall function, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's plan includes attempting to achieve a negative fluid balance by diuresis and reevaluating her respiratory status. If there is no progress, a right heart catheterization may be considered to evaluate pulmonary hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea.
- She presented to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion and was intubated.
- ABGs have improved, and an echo showed RV dilatation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient likely has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, and bronchospasm.
- There are no signs of pulmonary infection, and mini-BAL showed no evidence of infection.
- The patient is volume overloaded with gross anasarca in her legs and some in her belly.
- She is on a short steroid course for possible bronchospasm.
- Other ongoing treatments include Lasix gtt, albuterol and ipratropium inhalers, fentanyl and versed sedation, regular insulin sliding scale for type II diabetes, and holding home antihypertensives while on sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic dyspnea and acute respiratory failure indicate a risk of ongoing respiratory compromise. Continued monitoring and support through mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's echo findings suggest mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. This condition can lead to right ventricular strain and failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's history of type II diabetes increases the risk of complications such as hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or diabetic neuropathy.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other risk factors may predispose the patient to developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications if they dislodge and travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism).
5. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility and poor skin integrity can increase the risk of pressure ulcers (bedsores), which can become infected and lead to further complications.
6. Infection: Despite the absence of infection on mini-BAL, the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of acquiring hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's volume overload may contribute to further complications such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid balance are necessary.
8. Medication Reactions: The patient's medication regimen includes several drugs with potential side effects or interactions that need to be carefully managed to avoid adverse reactions.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, cardiac function, blood glucose levels, fluid balance, and nutritional support to prevent or manage these potential complications effectively."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. The patient presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion and has been intubated. The ABG results have improved, and the echo shows right ventricular dilatation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's condition is described as acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, possible bronchospasm with wheezing on exam. There are no signs of pulmonary infection, as indicated by the mini-BAL results.

The patient appears to be volume overloaded with gross anasarca in her legs and some in her belly. The patient has been started on a short steroid course for possible bronchospasm, but it does not seem to be helping. Aggressive diuresis is improving pulmonary edema based on the chest X-ray.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of ventilatory support are necessary.
2. Diabetic complications: The patient has type II diabetes, which increases the risk of complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring and management of blood sugar levels are crucial.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion, continues to be intubated but ABG
s have
   improved, now with echo showing RV dilatation and mild pulm art HTN.
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Likely combination
   of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and possibly pulmonary
   hypertension, diastolic heart failure, possible bronchospasm with
   wheezing on exam.  She does not appear to have signs of pulmonary
   infection at this time.  Mini-BAL also showed no evidence of infection.
   Likely volume overloaded with gross anasarca in her legs and some in
   her belly.  Started on short steroid course Prednisone for possible
   element of bronchospasm, these do not appear to be helping and patient
   is not wheezing. Aggressive diuresis seems to be improving pulmonary
   edema based on CXR.
     -D/c steroids
    - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
    - Continue Lasix gtt, appears that she is improving in terms of CXR
   for pulmonary edema
    - sedation with fentanyl and versed as tolerated
   Metabolic Alkalosis: Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Will
   give dose of acetazolamide and f/u ABG
   - Acetazolamide
   -F/u ABG after dose
   Type II Diabetes:
   - regular insulin sliding scale
   -blood sugars have been running in 200s, will add basal insulin as
   well
   Hypertension: Blood pressures in the 100s on sedation.
   - hold home antihypertensives while on sedation

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion and is currently intubated. The patient's ABG has improved, and the echo shows RV dilatation and mild pulmonary hypertension. The assessment suggests acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, possible pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, and bronchospasm with wheezing on exam. There are no signs of pulmonary infection at this time, as confirmed by mini-BAL. The patient appears to be volume overloaded with gross anasarca in her legs and some in her belly. 

The plan includes discontinuing steroids, continuing albuterol and ipratropium inhalers, continuing Lasix gtt, sedation with fentanyl and versed as tolerated, and giving a dose of acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis. Blood sugars have been running in the 200s, so basal insulin will be added. Hypertension management will be held while on sedation. Subcutaneous heparin, Pepcid, and a BM regimen will be started. Peripheral access will be maintained, and a PICC line has been placed. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending clinical improvement."

She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion and has been intubated. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results have improved, but she still has respiratory failure, most likely secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) has shown intermittent improvement with aggressive diuretic therapy. She also has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to aggressive diuretic use. Additionally, the patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly related to her diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and possibly pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, and bronchospasm with wheezing. There are no signs of pulmonary infection at this time. The patient appears to be volume overloaded with gross anasarca in her legs and some in her belly.

The patient has been started on a short steroid course for possible bronchospasm, but it does not seem to be helping. Aggressive diuresis is improving pulmonary edema based on the chest X-ray. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/56 mmHg to 160/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Blood glucose levels have been running in the 200s, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion and has been intubated. The patient's ABGs have improved, and an echocardiogram showed RV dilatation and mild pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Alkalosis, metabolic: This is most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. The patient's ABG after acetazolamide improved, but then became more acidotic again. Another dose of acetazolamide will be given.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has mini-BAL showing no evidence of infection, so there is less concern for bronchospasm or pulmonary infection.

3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has a history of chronic dyspnea, worsening dyspnea on exertion, and evidence of pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. The CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. The patient will attempt to diurese off, and obesity hypoventilation is also a concern.

4. Type II diabetes: Blood sugars have been running in the 200s, and basal insulin will be increased.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with respiratory failure in the setting of volume overload, likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). She is being diuresed well and is close to attempting extubation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 65 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 253 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 101 mEq/L.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure that is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The plan is to continue administering Lasix and diurese as tolerated to manage respiratory failure. Metabolic alkalosis is also present, and acetazolamide will be given four times to address this condition. The ICU team will manage"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with respiratory failure in the setting of volume overload, likely obstructive sleep apnea (OHS). She is currently receiving diuretic therapy and is tolerating it well. The patient's current medical conditions include metabolic alkalosis, impaired skin integrity, and a history of type II diabetes mellitus.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition requiring immediate attention. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory function will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may require treatment with medications such as acetazolamide. Regular monitoring of the patient's electrolyte levels and acid-base balance will be essential to ensure that the alkalosis is managed appropriately.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. Proper positioning, regular turning, and maintaining good skin hygiene will be important to prevent further skin breakdown.

4. Type II diabetes mellitus: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, which can contribute to poor wound healing and increase the risk of infections. Monitoring the patient's blood glucose levels and providing appropriate management will be necessary to optimize her diabetic control and minimize complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and address any potential"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion, continues to be intubated and trying to
   wean from vent.
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Most likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient
   CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per
   family patient gained approximately 60lb over the past month, most of
   which is likely fluid which we have been diuresing off. Also likely
   obesity hypoventilation. Less concern for bronchospasm as patient has
   not sounded wheezy on exam. No signs of pulmonary infection at this
   time, mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.
   - CO2 continues to rise but pt seems to tolerate it well, has been
   doing better on SBT
s, looking more comfortable
   - Likely can tolerate CO2
s of 80-90 and no current need to
   aggressively lower her CO2
   - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
   - Continue diuresis today
   - Have weaned sedation and will try to use as little as possible
   Metabolic Alkalosis: Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Now
   more acidotic yesterday with increased CO2 and increased HCO3. Will
   continue to give Acetazolamide and try to get CO2 down with vent.
   - Acetazolamide x1 dose today
   Type II Diabetes:
   - regular insulin sliding scale
   -blood sugars have been running in 100's yesterday, keep insulin as is
   Hypertension: Blood pressures in the 100s on sedation.
   - hold home antihypertensives while on sedation

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion and has been intubated and attempting to wean from the ventilator.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2 C (99 F)
- Heart rate: 87 bpm (with a range of 69-93 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 124/64 mmHg (with a range of 83/56-179/99 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (with a range of 5-22 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on supplemental oxygen

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including midazolam (a sedative), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and diuretics. She is also receiving tube feeds and her blood sugars are being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 3,315 mL through the length of stay (LOS), indicating good urine output. Her respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 10 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion and is currently intubated and trying to wean from the ventilator. The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, most likely secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Her CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. The patient gained approximately 60lbs over the past month, most of which is likely fluid that we have been diuresing off. Obesity hypoventilation is also a concern.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is experiencing respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Diabetic Complications: The patient has a history of type II diabetes, which puts her at risk for complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

3. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to pulmonary edema due to diastolic heart failure. This increases the risk of other cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.

4. Infection: Despite no signs of infection currently, the patient is at risk for developing hospital-acquired infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Assessment and Plan
   61-year-old woman with respiratory failure, likely related to a
   combination of volume overload (cor pulmonale) and
   obesity-hypoventilation.  We have made substantial progress with
   diuresis (net -12.5 L).  Her post-SBT blood gas was more hypercarbic
   than we might hope (7.31 / 91 /  76).  This reflects both metabolic
   alkalosis from diuresis, and her  obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.
   There is no evidence of infection.  We will continue to attempt -2L per
   day, and keep bicarb closer to 40 if possible using Diamox.  Her
   sedation is essentially optimized.  Wean PSV as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion. We have been successfully diuresing her
   and she continues to improve but currently having difficulty weaning
   from vent due to high RSBI's.
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Most likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient
   CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per
   family patient gained approximately 60lb over the past month, most of
   which is likely fluid which we have been diuresing off. Also likely
   obesity hypoventilation. Less concern for bronchospasm as patient has
   not sounded wheezy on exam. No signs of pulmonary infection at this
   time, mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.
   - Continue to diurese her, currently at 2mg/hr of Lasix with continued
   goal of 1-2L/day
   - Tolerating CO2's of 80-90 with well compensated HCO3.
   - Will not be too aggressive with lowering of CO2
   - Will continue to wean her, she is currently on CPAP [**10-10**], 40%
   - Continue daily SBT and RSBI's
   - OOB to chair daily
   - Sedation has been weaned to Versed 0.5 mg/hr, she appears comfortable
   - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
   - Consider extubation today if does well on SBT
   Metabolic Alkalosis as compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis:
   Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Has now gotten 5 doses of
   Acetazolamide.
   - Acetazolamide x1 dose today
   Type II Diabetes:
   - regular insulin sliding scale
   -blood sugars have been running in 100's yesterday, keep insulin as is

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion. We have been successfully diuresing her
   and she continues to improve but currently having difficulty weaning
   from vent due to high RSBI's.
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Most likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient
   CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per
   family patient gained approximately 60lb over the past month, most of
   which is likely fluid which we have been diuresing off. Also likely
   obesity hypoventilation. Less concern for bronchospasm as patient has
   not sounded wheezy on exam. No signs of pulmonary infection at this
   time, mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.
   - Continue to diurese her, currently at 2mg/hr of Lasix with continued
   goal of 1-2L/day
   - Tolerating CO2's of 80-90 with well compensated HCO3.
   - Will not be too aggressive with lowering of CO2
   - Will continue to wean her, she is currently on CPAP [**10-10**], 40%
   - Continue daily SBT and RSBI's
   - OOB to chair daily
   - Sedation has been weaned to Versed 0.5 mg/hr, she appears comfortable
   - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
   - Consider extubation today if does well on SBT
   Metabolic Alkalosis as compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis:
   Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Has now gotten 5 doses of
   Acetazolamide.
   - Acetazolamide x1 dose today
   Type II Diabetes:
   - regular insulin sliding scale
   -blood sugars have been running in 100's yesterday, keep insulin as is

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events: received diamox, diuresed, able to wean PSV to 10 sitting
   upright.
   VS notable for T98.8, -1.5L O/N.
   Exam notable for an obese woman in NAD, sitting up, ETT in place.  She
   is awake and alert.  Decreased BS B/L.
   Labs notable for stable CBC, Cr 0.7, bicarb of 43.
   Meds include: lasix gtt, diamox.
   ABG 7.31/92/76.  PSV 10/5 TV 200
   CXR: R effusion, low lung volumes.
   Respiratory failure in setting of obesity (likely obesity
   hypoventilation), CHF; no evidence of infection.  Doing slightly
   better; she is diuresing well, resp status appears to be improving.
   Getting diamox to manage metabolic alkalosis.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past month. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. 

Key points from the note include:

1. The patient is receiving diuretic therapy to manage fluid overload.
2. She has difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation due to high RSBI (Respiratory System Impairment Index).
3. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and diastolic heart failure.
4. There are no signs of infection based on negative microbiology tests.
5. The patient has metabolic alkalosis as compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
6. She has a history of type II diabetes and is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.
7. The patient has been improving with continued diuresis and daily spontaneous breathing trials.
8. The plan is to continue diuretic therapy, wean sedation, and consider extubation if she does well on spontaneous breathing trials.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past month. She has been successfully diuresed and continues to improve but is currently having difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation due to high RSBI's. The patient's condition is complicated by acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. There are also signs of metabolic alkalosis as compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis, most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. The patient has impaired skin integrity and a history of diabetes mellitus, type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation indicates a risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and assessment of RSBI's should be done to guide further management.

2. Pneumonia: Although the mini BAL showed no evidence of infection, it is essential to monitor for any signs of pneumonia, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory status.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and obesity are risk factors for DVT. The use of subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis is appropriate, but close monitoring for signs of DVT, such as leg swelling or pain, is necessary.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion. We have been successfully diuresing her
   and she continues to improve but currently having difficulty weaning
   from vent due to high RSBI's.
   #Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Most likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient
   CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per
   family patient gained approximately 60lb over the past month, most of
   which is likely fluid which we have been diuresing off. Also likely
   obesity hypoventilation. Less concern for bronchospasm as patient has
   not sounded wheezy on exam. No signs of pulmonary infection at this
   time, mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.  Patient did well on
   RSBI this morning while in bed, lowest RSBI while in bed. Breathing
   further improves while up in chair.
   - Continue to diurese her, currently at 1mg/hr of Lasix with continued
   goal of 1-2L/day, will change to Lasix 10mg IV BID and continue to
   assess to ensure -2L daily
   - Tolerating CO2's of 80-90 with well compensated HCO3.
   - OOB to chair daily
   - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
   -Extubate
   -Plan for noninvasive ventilation, especially when sleeping, patient
   agrees
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Has
   now gotten 6 doses of Acetazolamide. Improved.
   -Continue to monitor
   #Type II Diabetes:
   - regular insulin sliding scale
   -blood sugars have been running in 100's yesterday, keep insulin as is
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, once extubated will plan to start
   diabetic diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, Pepcid, start BM regimen

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past month. The patient has been successfully diuresing and continues to improve but is currently having difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to high RSBI's.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alkalosis, metabolic: Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Has now gotten 6 doses of acetazolamide. Improved.
   - Continue to monitor
2. Impaired skin integrity: Due to prolonged bedrest and obesity.
   - Regularly reposition the patient to prevent pressure ulcers.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Most likely secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient's CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per family, patient gained approximately 60lbs over the past month, most of which is likely fluid being diuresed off. Also likely obesity hypoventilation.
   - Continue to diurese her, currently at 1mg/hr of Lasix with continued goal of 1-2L/day, will change to Lasix 10mg IV BID and continue to assess to ensure -2L daily.
   - Tolerating CO2's of 80-90 with well-compensated HCO3.
   - Out of bed to a chair daily.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium inhalers.
   - Plan for noninvasive ventilation, especially when sleeping, patient agrees.
   - Extubate.
   
Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Prolonged ventilator dependence: The patient is currently having difficulty weaning from the ventilator, which may lead to prolonged ventilator dependence.
2. Respiratory infections: Prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged bedrest and obesity put her at risk for developing pressure ulcers.
4. Diabetic complications: The patient has a history of type II diabetes, which may lead to further complications such as hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis if not properly managed.
5. Fluid overload: Despite aggressive diuresis, there is still a risk of fluid overload due to ongoing negative fluid balance.
6. Cardiac issues: The patient's symptoms suggest a possible underlying cardiac condition such as diastolic heart failure, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
7. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis needs to be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications related to electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on CPAP support. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/55 to 132/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 155 kg at admission to 128 kg currently.

The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning with a respiratory rate and tidal volume (VT) ratio (RSBI) of 160. His fluid balance is negative by 2.3 liters, and he continues to receive 1 mg/hour of Lasix. Acetazolamide has been added for persistent metabolic alkalosis. The patient's gas exchange on CPAP is good, with a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 82, PaO2 of 242, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, but the patient is responding appropriately to questions and no longer sedated. He has multiple ventral hernias and is obese. Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, slightly low hemoglobin, normal white blood cell count, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows an improving right pleural effusion."

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion. We have been successfully diuresing her
   and she continues to improve but currently having difficulty weaning
   from vent due to high RSBI's.
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Most likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient
   CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per
   family patient gained approximately 60lb over the past month, most of
   which is likely fluid which we have been diuresing off. Also likely
   obesity hypoventilation. Less concern for bronchospasm as patient has
   not sounded wheezy on exam. No signs of pulmonary infection at this
   time, mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.
   - Continue to diurese her, currently at 1 mg/hr of Lasix with continued
   goal of 1-2L/day
   - Tolerating CO2's of 80-90 with well compensated HCO3.
   - Will not be too aggressive with lowering of CO2
   - OOB to chair daily
   - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
   - Consider extubation today if does well on SBT
   Metabolic Alkalosis as compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis:
   Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Has now gotten 5 doses of
   Acetazolamide.
   - Acetazolamide x1 dose today

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea.
- She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion for the past month.
- She has been successfully diuresing and continues to improve but has difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to high Respiratory System Compliance Index (RSBI).
- The patient has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure.
- Her chest X-ray has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis.
- She also has obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
- There are no signs of pulmonary infection at this time, as mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.
- The patient tolerates CO2 levels of 80-90 with well-compensated HCO3.
- She will continue to be diuresed, aiming for a daily negative fluid balance of 2 liters.
- Metabolic alkalosis is likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
- She has received 6 doses of acetazolamide, which improved her condition.
- Type II diabetes management includes regular insulin sliding scale and planning to start a diabetic diet once extubated.
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin, Pepcid, and bowel movement regimen.

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion. We have been successfully diuresing her
   and she continues to improve but currently having difficulty weaning
   from vent due to high RSBI's.
   #Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Most likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient
   CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per
   family patient gained approximately 60lb over the past month, most of
   which is likely fluid which we have been diuresing off. Also likely
   obesity hypoventilation. Less concern for bronchospasm as patient has
   not sounded wheezy on exam. No signs of pulmonary infection at this
   time, mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.  Patient did well on
   RSBI this morning while in bed, lowest RSBI while in bed. Breathing
   further improves while up in chair.
   - Continue to diurese her, currently at 2mg/hr of Lasix with continued
   goal of 1-2L/day
   - Tolerating CO2's of 80-90 with well compensated HCO3.
   - Will not be too aggressive with lowering of CO2
   - Continue daily SBT and RSBI's
   - OOB to chair daily
   - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
   -Extubate
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Has
   now gotten 6 doses of Acetazolamide.
   #Type II Diabetes:
   - regular insulin sliding scale
   -blood sugars have been running in 100's yesterday, keep insulin as is

","Summary:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea.
- She presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past month.
- She is currently in the ICU and has been successfully diuresed but is having difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to high RSBI's (respiratory system impairment index).
- The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
- She also has impaired skin integrity and a history of diabetes mellitus type II.
- The patient's respiratory failure is acute but not ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- The patient's condition is improving, and she is tolerating CO2 levels of 80-90 with well-compensated HCO3.
- She will continue with daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and respiratory system impairment index (RSBI) assessments.
- She will be taken out of bed to a chair daily and will continue with albuterol and ipratropium inhalers.
- The plan is to extubate the patient.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/55 mmHg to 132/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

   and she continues to improve but currently having difficulty weaning
   from vent due to high RSBI's.
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Most likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient
   CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per
   family patient gained approximately 60lb over the past month, most of
   which is likely fluid which we have been diuresing off. Also likely
   obesity hypoventilation. Less concern for bronchospasm as patient has
   not sounded wheezy on exam. No signs of pulmonary infection at this
   time, mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history
   of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea
   who presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
   worsening dyspnea on exertion. We have been successfully diuresing her
   and she continues to improve but currently having difficulty weaning
   from vent due to high RSBI's.
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Most likely
   secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. Patient
   CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. Per
   family patient gained approximately 60lb over the past month, most of
   which is likely fluid which we have been diuresing off. Also likely
   obesity hypoventilation. Less concern for bronchospasm as patient has
   not sounded wheezy on exam. No signs of pulmonary infection at this
   time, mini BAL showed no evidence of infection.
   - Continue to diurese her, currently at 1 mg/hr of Lasix with continued
   goal of 1-2L/day
   - Tolerating CO2's of 80-90 with well compensated HCO3.
   - Will not be too aggressive with lowering of CO2
   - OOB to chair daily
   - Continue albuterol and iptratropium inhalers
   - Consider extubation today if does well on SBT
   Metabolic Alkalosis as compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis:
   Most likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. Has now gotten 5 doses of
   Acetazolamide.
   - Acetazolamide x1 dose today
   Type II Diabetes:
   - regular insulin sliding scale
   -blood sugars have been running in 100's yesterday, keep insulin as is
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, Tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, Pepcid, start BM regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presented to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past month. The patient has been successfully diuresed and continues to improve, but currently has difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to high RSBI's.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.1 C (98.8 F), HR: 93 bpm, BP: 119/55 mmHg, RR: 24 insp/min, SpO2: 99%. The patient is on CPAP [**10-10**] and has a gas exchange of 7.32/83/97/45. The patient's weight is currently 128 kg, with a goal of 1-2 liters negative fluid balance.

The patient's lab results show an HbA1C of 9.8%, blood glucose of 167 mg/dL, WBC count of 8.3 K/uL, Hct of 35.8%, Plt of 135 K/uL, and Cr of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows an interval improvement in right pleural effusion, with overall relatively unchanged findings.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with metabolic alkalosis, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic dyspnea. She presents to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past month. The patient has been successfully diuresed and extubated, tolerating a nasal cannula. She has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, most likely secondary to pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure. The patient's CXR has been intermittently improving with aggressive diuresis. There are no signs of pulmonary infection at this time. The patient is tolerating CO2 levels of 80-90 with well-compensated HCO3. She will continue to be diuresed with 10mg of furosemide IV, receive physical therapy and occupational therapy consults, and have a social work consult for compliance. The patient's metabolic alkalosis has resolved, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis, and she will receive one dose of acetazolamide today. Her type II diabetes will be managed with regular insulin sliding scale, and her blood sugars have been running in the 100's yesterday, so the insulin regimen will be kept as is. The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin, Pepcid, and a bowel management regimen. She has arterial and PICC lines in place. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement.
