 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs
   .
   Hypertension - on HCTZ and amlodipine
   - will hold for now
   .
   Hyperlipidemia - on lescol at home
   - will restart when extubated
   .
   FEN - NPO, gentle fluids, replete lytes, replete B12, thiamine and
   folate

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope. She was brought to the emergency department after experiencing a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground. The patient was intubated in the emergency department due to altered mental status, and a head CT was negative for any acute bleeds.

The patient's labs are generally unremarkable except for mildly elevated lactate levels, which were attributed to violent thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation. The lactate levels have since normalized with gentle fluids and time. The patient's history was obtained from her son, who reports that she frequently experiences falls and is normally seen at Hospital6.

The patient's altered mental status is attributed to trauma from the fall, toxic metabolic, infection, or delirium. The head CT scan was negative for acute bleeds, and the patient's white blood cell count trended down to normal with gentle fluids. A chest X-ray and urinalysis were negative for occult infection.

The plan is to decrease sedation and extubate the patient in the morning. It is recommended to check B12, Thiamine, and Folate levels, then replete as necessary. A follow-up urine culture is also suggested. If the patient remains agitated once extubated, considering using Haldol as needed is recommended.

Regarding the patient's syncope/fall, she loses consciousness before falling"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope. She was brought to the emergency department after experiencing a fall and head trauma. The patient was intubated due to altered mental status. Her head CT scan was negative, and her labs were mostly unremarkable except for a mildly elevated lactate level, which was attributed to violent thrashing before sedation and intubation. The patient's history was obtained from her son, who reports frequent falls and unrevealing syncope work-ups. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status - The patient's mental competence at baseline is normal, but there could be various etiologies for her agitation and alteration, including trauma from the fall, toxic metabolic, infection, or delirium. A head CT scan was negative, and her white blood cell count has trended down to normal with gentle fluids. CXR and UA were negative for occult infection. Blood cultures are positive, so antibiotics will be considered if signs of infection appear. Decrease sedation and extubation will be done in the morning. Check B12, Thiamine, and Folate levels, then replete them. Follow-up urine culture is needed. If agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed. Clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low risk for ligamentous injury"

 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was
   violently thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With
   gentle fluids and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's
   histroy was obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite
   frequently.  She is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope
   work-ups have been unrevealing todate.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   .
   Syncope - Per report, pt lost consiousness before she fell.  Per son
   and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of consciousness.
   Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension, MI, or other
   neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive work-up at [**Hospital1 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood glucose 156 in
   field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not available in [**Hospital3 140**]
   records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG, cardiac enzymes negative
   x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to facilitate beta 2-receptor
   blockade and assist with some possible neurogenic causes of her
   symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink anything but coffee that
   he is aware of and is often light-headed when she stands up.  BBlocke
   rnad/or CCB could be contributing to hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - conitnue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agtation and combativeness.  Liklely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - will recheck in am

","The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope who presented to the emergency department after experiencing a fall. She was intubated in the ED due to altered mental status, and a head CT was negative. The patient's labs were unremarkable except for a mildly elevated lactate and acidemia, which was attributed to her violent thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation. With gentle fluids and time, her lactate levels have decreased.

The patient's history was obtained from her son, who reported that she falls frequently and is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**]. Syncope work-ups have been unrevealing to date. 

The patient's altered mental status could be due to trauma from the fall, toxic metabolic, infection, or delirium. The head CT was negative for acute bleed. The patient had a mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, but it has trended down to normal with gentle fluids. CXR and UA were negative for occult infection.

The patient's syncope may be caused by vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension, MI, or other neurological causes such as seizure, TIA, etc. An extensive work-up at [**Hospital1 **] over the years has been unrevealing. Blood glucose in the field was 156 mg/dL. The patient had an ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**], but the report is not available in [**Hospital3 140**] records. There was no evidence of arrhythmia on EKG, and cardiac enzymes were negative x1. The patient is currently on a B-Blocker to facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible neurogenic causes of her symptoms. The son reported that the patient does not drink anything but coffee and is often light-headed when standing up. It is suggested to hold the B-Blocker and calcium channel blocker for now. Further evaluation, including ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1, and carotid dopplers, is recommended.

The patient's elevated lactate levels may be due to infection or muscle exertion in the setting of extreme agitation and combativeness. It is likely due to the latter. With time and gentle fluids, the acidemia and elevated lactate have resolved. Rechecking in the morning is advised.

The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on HCTZ and amlodipine. However, it is suggested to hold the antihypertensive medications for now.

The patient also has hyperlipidemia and is on lescol at home. It is recommended to restart the medication when the patient is extubated.

The patient is currently NPO, receiving gentle fluids, and electrolytes will be repleted. B12, thiamine, and folate will also be checked and repleted.

Prophylaxis measures include heparin subcutaneously, VAP bundle, pneumoboots, and PT/OT consult. The patient's code status is full code.

Contact information is provided for [**Name (NI) **], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2366**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6201**].

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate line placements. Prophylactic measures are in place for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's condition will be discussed on interdisciplinary rounds, and a family meeting has already been held. The patient's consent for ICU care has been obtained.

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs
   .
   Hypertension - on HCTZ and amlodipine
   - will hold for now
   .
   Hyperlipidemia - on lescol at home
   - will restart when extubated
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope who was brought to the emergency department after experiencing a fall and head trauma. She was intubated due to altered mental status, which has been attributed to trauma, metabolic issues, infection, or delirium. Head CT scans have been negative for acute bleeds. The patient's white blood cell count on admission was elevated but has since normalized with gentle fluids. Chest X-ray and urinalysis did not show signs of infection.

The patient's son reports that she frequently falls and experiences loss of consciousness. Extensive work-ups in the past have been unrevealing, including an echo, blood glucose level of 156, and cardiac enzymes negative once. The patient is on a beta-blocker to facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with possible neurogenic causes of her symptoms. There is no evidence of arrhythmia on the EKG.

The patient is currently being treated for respiratory failure, elevated lactate levels, and hypertension. Troponin levels are in an indeterminate range but have trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this morning. CK levels are also trending up, but the MD flatline is mentioned. The patient's blood pressure medication and calcium channel blocker have been held for now.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated in the setting of altered mental"

   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently

","The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope who presented to the emergency department after experiencing a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground. She was intubated in the emergency department for altered mental status so that a thorough work-up could be conducted. The patient's labs were largely unremarkable, except for a mildly elevated lactate and acidemia which were attributed to the fact that she was violently thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation. With gentle fluids and time, her lactate has come back down. The patient's history was obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently. She is normally seen at [Hospital6 5579]. Syncope work-ups have been unrevealing to date.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 120/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is receiving invasive ventilation support. The patient is alert and oriented, although she appears to be in some distress. Her general appearance is that of a well-nourished, thin elderly woman who is not in acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds (S1 and S2) and peripheral pulses. Her respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremity pulses are absent bilaterally. She has diffuse ecchymosis on her skin. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, but no further assessment can be done due to her intubation. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, mildly elevated lactate, and elevated troponin levels. Imaging studies include a negative head CT and carotid dopplers.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient was intubated due to altered mental status and is currently on minimal settings of ventilation support.
2. Hypoxia - The patient's oxygen saturation is slightly below the normal range.
3. Infection - The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and is being treated with antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
4. Myocardial Infarction - The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac injury.
5. Fall Risk - The patient frequently experiences falls, which can increase the risk of injury and complications.
6. Syncope - The patient has a history of syncope, which can be caused by various underlying conditions.
7. Hypertension - The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on medication for blood pressure control.
8. Hyperlipidemia - The patient has a history of high cholesterol levels.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with recurrent syncope who presented after a fall/syncope and required emergent intubation due to agitation and need for a HCT/neck CT scan. The patient was extubated but then developed hypoxia and a right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 100.3°C
- Pulse: 82 bpm
- Blood pressure: 121/43 mmHg
- Oxygen saturation: 95% on 3.5 liters nasal cannula

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with decreased breath sounds on the right side. The physical examination also reveals no edema and normal heart sounds (S1, S2 regular).

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Resp failure: The patient appears to have aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe. Levofloxacin is being given for now, along with a swallow evaluation, continuous oxygen via nasal cannula, and Advair 250/50 [Hospital1] and Spireva as needed.
2. Syncope: Extensive negative workup.
3. htn: Home medications are being held.
4. FEN: Modify diet according to swallow evaluation.
5. PT/OT consult.

The patient has altered mental status (not delirium), impaired skin integrity, and altered nutrition. The patient's laboratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical issues and complications. They were admitted with respiratory failure, syncope, hypertension, and malnutrition. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring invasive ventilation and multiple interventions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition. They are currently on non-invasive ventilation but may require further respiratory support.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to impaired swallowing and nutrition, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by diminished breath sounds diffusely in the chest.
3. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, but it is not classified as delirium. However, the patient may be at risk of developing delirium due to the critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
5. Malnutrition: The patient has altered nutrition, which can lead to further complications and delayed recovery.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of shock.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Being immobilized in the ICU, the patient is at an increased risk for developing DVTs, requiring prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin.

These potential medical complications need to be closely monitored and managed to optimize the patient's outcome."
