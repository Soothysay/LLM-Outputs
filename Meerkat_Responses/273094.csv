","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been receiving IVF bolus to maintain urine output and has been given 5 liters of normal saline solution so far. There are mild crackles in the left lung base, and a chest X-ray earlier was clear. The patient is on tol PS trial with PEEP at 12, MV around 5, and RR unchanged. Therapeutic hypothermia (TF) was held at 3 am. The respiratory system blood index (RSBI) is in the 50s this morning, and the patient is being weaned down on PS and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning. Possible extubation is planned for later today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and possible infectious exacerbation.
2. Fever, which may be concerning for an infectious process of unknown source, especially in the context of pulmonary process.
3. Leukocytosis, possibly secondary to infection or steroid effect.
4. Guaiac positive stool and coffee-ground emesis on OG lavage, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding due to known gastritis.
5. History of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarctions (MI's).
6. Gastritis, osteoporosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She required intubation due to a COPD flare-up. The patient is currently receiving stress-dose steroids, her home medications, and antibiotic coverage with levofloxacin. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 138/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has mild crackles at the left lung base on lung examination. The chest X-ray is clear. The patient is not sedated but is intubated and answers yes/no questions and follows commands. She reports feeling slightly better in the morning and denies cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, or chills.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD, there is a potential for worsening respiratory failure or pneumonia due to the recent intubation and infection.
2. Infectious Complications: The presence of fevers on presentation and the growth of Strep pneumonia in the sputum culture suggest a possible infectious exacerbation of COPD.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The guaiac positive stool and coffee-ground emesis indicate gastrointestinal bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including gastritis, osteoporosis, depression, and a history of thrush/esophagitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial reason for admission was respiratory failure, likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation. There is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying COPD condition worsens or if there is an infectious exacerbation.
2. Infectious Exacerbation: The patient presented with fevers on admission, suggesting a possible infectious exacerbation of COPD. Continued monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic coverage are necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had leukocytosis, which has since trended down. However, it is important to follow up on blood culture results to identify any potential sources of infection.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has guaiac positive stool and coffee-ground emesis on OG lavage, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be related to her known gastritis or other underlying conditions.
5. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient has a history of CAD with previous myocardial infarctions (MIs). It is important to continue medication therapy with Plavix and a statin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl for pain control, heparin for prophylaxis, and a bowel regimen for abdominal pain/distention. She also has gastritis and is being treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's family history includes osteoporosis and depression, for which she is taking vitamin D supplements and paroxetine/olanzapine respectively. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial admission was due to respiratory failure, and there is a possibility of further complications related to her underlying COPD.
2. Gastritis and gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of coffee-ground emesis on OG lavage indicates possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be monitored closely.
3. Thromboembolic events: As the patient is immobilized and has a history of CAD, there is an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a suspected respiratory infection, indicating a risk of developing healthcare-associated infections.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged bed rest in the ICU can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Venous thromboembolism ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including captopril, diltiazem, furosemide, midazolam, heparin sodium, fentanyl, and others. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/99 to 137/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on RA. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, PaO2 of 220, and HCO3- of 87 mEq/L. Her WBC count is elevated at 23.7 K/uL, and her platelet count is slightly low at 330 K/uL. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range. She has guaiac-positive stool and coffee-ground emesis, which may indicate gastritis. There is no evidence of abdominal obstruction or ileus on KUB imaging. The patient's chest X-ray shows new left basilar opacity, likely representing atelectasis and effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for respiratory failure due to a COPD flare-up and required intubation. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics, antibiotics, and respiratory support. Her condition has been unstable with concerns about fluid overload, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiac history. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 157/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. A chest X-ray reveals a new left basilar opacity, possibly atelectasis and effusion. The patient's overall plan includes continued respiratory support, steroid therapy, antibiotic treatment, and close monitoring for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing PE. Regular assessment of vital signs, particularly any sudden onset of shortness of breath or chest"

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had SOB on PSV 10/5 yesterday afternoon and was tachy and HTN
   at the same time.  She was diaphoretic.  Checked an EKG (no acute
   ischemia/infarct) and enzymes.  We gave a 250 cc fluid bolus with the
   thought that we were diuresing her too fast.  Starting dilt and
   increased captopril dose.
   Since she was having difficulty breathing on PSV we started Assist
   control and restarted TF with the idea of resting her overnight and
   trying to extubate this am.  TF held since 2 am and patient switched
   back to PSV this morning.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient required intubation due to a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a respiratory infection. She was previously intubated multiple times for COPD flares.

The patient experienced an episode of shortness of breath (SOB) on pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday afternoon, along with tachycardia and hypertension. She was diaphoretic at the time. An EKG was performed, showing no acute ischemia or infarction. The patient received a 250 cc fluid bolus as a diuretic was thought to be given too rapidly. Diltiazem and increased captopril dose were started.

Since the patient had difficulty breathing on PSV, assist-control ventilation (ACV) was initiated, and the tracheostomy (TF) was restarted. The patient was switched back to PSV this morning, but TF was held since 2 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/80 mmHg to 126/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycard"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a COPD flare-up. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient experienced shortness of breath (SOB) on pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday afternoon, along with tachycardia and hypertension. An EKG showed no acute ischemia or infarct, and cardiac enzymes were checked. A fluid bolus was given to address possible fluid overload from excessive diuresis. The patient was started on diltiazem and the dose of captopril was increased.

The patient's respiratory status improved overnight, and she was switched back to PSV. Her respiratory index of breathlessness (RISB) was measured at 77. The patient reported feeling better in the morning, but still had abdominal pain similar to the previous day. She had not had a bowel movement in two days but did not experience nausea, vomiting, fevers, or chills.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/80 to 164/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and communicative but intubated.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation due to a COPD flare-up in the setting of a respiratory infection. 

Summary of Progress:
- The patient had shortness of breath (SOB) on pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday afternoon and was tachycardic and hypertensive at the same time. She was also diaphoretic.
- An electrocardiogram (EKG) was checked and showed no acute ischemia or infarct.
- A fluid bolus of 250 cc was given to address possible overdiuresis.
- Diltiazem and increased captopril doses were started.
- The patient had difficulty breathing on PSV, so the ventilator mode was changed to assist control, and tidal volume (TV) with rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) was restarted.
- The patient's SOB is better this morning, but she still has abdominal pain.
- She has not had a bowel movement in two days, but has no nausea, vomiting, fevers, or chills.
- Her allergies include tetracyclines, and her last dose of antibiotics was unknown.
- The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions.
- Other medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has been experiencing multiple COPD exacerbations in the setting of a respiratory infection. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, but non-invasive ventilation has been attempted intermittently. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/61 mmHg to 153/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which could lead to further deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The presence of a respiratory infection could potentially lead to worsening of the respiratory status or development of a new infection while in the ICU.
3. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a slightly elevated platelet count and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a potential bleeding risk.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The guaiac positive stool and coffee-ground emesis suggest possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation with a full face mask, initially set at pressure support (PS) 12, 5 cmH2O peak inspiratory pressure (PEEP), and fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 0.40. The non-invasive ventilation was stopped at 3:00 PM. The patient's confusion and occasional desaturation below 80% were observed.

The patient is receiving various medications including furosemide, lansoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin sodium. She has a history of allergies to tetracyclines and unknown allergies. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for dyspnea and wheezing.

Vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 104 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging between 139/61 mmHg and 153/100 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. The patient's neurological assessment is not fully evaluated.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has undergone multiple prior intubations for COPD flares. She has been on invasive ventilation since [2205-5-30] 02:00 AM and switched to non-invasive ventilation at [2205-5-30] 02:00 PM. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 139/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea and wheezing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which has led to her current admission and intubation. There is a potential risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to decreased oxygenation and carbon dioxide retention.

2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD exacerbations suggests that she may experience recurrent episodes of worsening respiratory symptoms. This can be a potential complication and should be closely monitored.

3. Infection: The patient is currently on antibiotics for a suspected respiratory infection. There is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance or a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been extubated to non-invasive ventilation and is currently doing well on NC 5L. The patient's medical history includes multiple prior intubations for COPD flares, gastritis, osteoporosis with history of multiple compression and rib fractures from coughing, depression, and prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's history of COPD exacerbations and recent respiratory failure, there is a potential for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Delirium: The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, which may be due to hypercarbia, steroids, or sundowning. It is important to manage delirium symptoms and prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient has hypertension and tachycardia, which require careful management to prevent complications such as heart attack or stroke.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of myocardial infarction or other cardiac events. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Gastritis: The patient has a history of gastritis, and ongoing management with proton pump"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for respiratory failure requiring intubation due to a COPD flare-up in the setting of a respiratory infection. The patient has been extubated to non-invasive ventilation and is doing well on 5 liters of nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 102 bpm with a sinus tachycardia rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 147/60 mmHg to 179/133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals mild effort with diffuse wheezing bilaterally, decreased bowel sounds, and warm extremities with 2+ radial pulses and 1+ pedal pulses.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, platelet count of 308 K/uL, creatinine levels ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 94 to 98 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels below the detection limit. Other lab values are within normal"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to a COPD flare-up in the setting of a respiratory infection. The patient's medical history includes multiple prior intubations for COPD exacerbations. 

On 05/29, the patient was extubated to non-invasive ventilation but had substantial work of breathing to maintain oxygen saturation on a 40% face mask. Since then, she has been on BiPAP as tolerated, with an increased frequency of nebulizer treatments every 2 hours. Diuretics are being continued with a volume goal of -1.5 liters per 24 hours. Prednisone taper is ongoing, and the patient is receiving inhaled corticosteroids (flovent) in addition to her home regimen of montelukast, levalbuterol, and tiotropium. Levofloxacin is being continued for suspected pneumococcal bronchitis versus pneumonia.

The patient also has delirium, hypertension/tachycardia, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarctions (MI's), gastritis, osteoporosis, history of thrush/esophagitis, depression, and requires prophylaxis for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to a COPD flare-up. The patient has been extubated and is currently on non-invasive ventilation with a nasal cannula at 2L. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
- Heart rate: 114 bpm (normal range: 106-123 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 118/37 mmHg (normal range: 98/34-154/78 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (normal range: 9-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on 6L NC

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 20.9 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
- Hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL (normal range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL for females)
- Blood glucose: 101 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL)
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL)
- Sodium: 142 mEq/L (normal range: 135-145 mEq/L)
- Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L)

The patient's chest X-ray is clear of any major changes, with no newly occurred parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia, no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of COPD and previous intubation, there is a risk of recurring respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of respiratory infections, and the use of steroids may increase the risk of pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
4. Delirium: The combination of hypercarbia, steroids, and sundowning may contribute to delirium.
5. Gastritis: Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids can lead to gastritis.
6. Osteoporosis: Chronic steroid use and the patient's history of multiple compression and rib fractures from coughing increase the risk of osteoporosis.
7. Thrush: Prolonged use of corticosteroids increases the risk of developing oral thrush.
8. Depression: The patient's medical condition and medication regimen may contribute to depressive symptoms.

It is important to closely monitor the patient for these potential complications and manage them appropriately."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute on chronic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF) - chronic systolic, mitral regurgitation (MR), and protein malnourishment. Anemia is also noted.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/47 mmHg to 142/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation using a nasal cannula, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 30%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 66 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 213.

The patient's laboratory values indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 20.9 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 36.9%, increased platelet count (Plt) of 322 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL, and abnormal electrolyte levels including potassium (K+) of 3.8 mEq/L and sodium (Na+) of 142 mEq/L. Other lab results show elevated troponin-T levels and abnormal cardiac enzymes.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of COPD, acute on chronic respiratory failure, CHF, MR, protein malnourishment, and anemia. The patient requires standing Lasix for fluid management, more afterload reduction, encouragement of calorie and protein intake, and potential discontinuation to rehab with continued intermittent mask ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include exacerbation of COPD, worsening heart failure, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent these complications."

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has been extubated and is now on non-invasive ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 122/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her general appearance is described as thin and not in acute distress. 

On physical examination, her cardiovascular system is normal, with no murmurs detected. Her respiratory system is clear bilaterally, and her abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present but tender in the right upper quadrant (RUQ). She has trace edema in both lower extremities and warm skin. Neurologically, she is attentive, oriented, and has purposeful movements without any signs of sedation or abnormal tone.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.0 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and conditions, including respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, hypertension, delirium, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarctions"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation, but is now extubated and adequately oxygenated on nasal cannula (NC). The patient has been on aggressive diuresis and a 7-day course of antibiotics. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbations, which can be triggered by infections, fluid overload, or both. Monitoring for symptoms such as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, and changes in lung function is important.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. However, she is asymptomatic and cultures have been negative. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated and may be due to sinus tachycardia. This could be related to her COPD, heart failure, or medication effects. Close monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is necessary.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient has chronic abdominal pain, which appears to be related to constipation. Implementing a bowel regimen can help manage this symptom.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with medication, but regular monitoring is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation, now extubated and adequately oxygenated on nasal cannula (NC). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/47 mmHg to 146/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 15.7 to 23.2 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin concentration ranging from 36.6% to 39.8%, platelet count ranging from 150 to 210 thousand cells per microliter, and creatinine levels ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD flare-up may have occurred due to respiratory infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), volume overload, or a combination of both. She was extubated after aggressive diuresis and a 7-day course of antibiotics and is currently on non-invasive ventilation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has been extubated and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/47 mmHg to 98/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 52 kg at admission to 48.8 kg currently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and the current symptoms suggest a potential exacerbation of her condition. This could be due to a respiratory infection or volume overload.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, but is asymptomatic and without signs of infection. Cultures have been negative, and steroids are being tapered.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is within normal limits but may be maintained at higher rates to compensate for mitral regurgitation (MR). There is no immediate cause for concern, and antihypertensive medication is being adjusted.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with her current regimen of lisin"

   61 yo F with a history of CAD and COPD with multiple prior intubations
   for COPD flares admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation,
   now extubated with adequate oxygenation on NC.
   .
   # COPD exacerbation
 Unclear whether this occurred in the setting of
   respiratory infection or, more likely, CHF/volume overload, or both.
   Was extubated to non-invasive ventilation following aggressive diuresis
   and a 7 day course of antibiotics, now adeq. O2 sat on 4L NC (on 2L NC
   at home)
   - Change bronchodilator nebs to MDI
   - Cont. prednisone 10 mg (was on this dose on admission)
   - [**Hospital1 **] flovent

   #Leukocytosis
 Afebrile, asymptomatic, no focal signs suggestive of
   infection. Cultures have been NTD. Steroids being tapered.
   -Continue to trend WBC, follow clinically
   .
   #Tachycardia
 HR 90-120s sinus tach; likely requires these rates to
   maintain CO given degree of MR; BP stable; low likelihood of suspicion
   for PE as not hypotensive and has been on PPx
   -will refrain from treating at this time

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation and is now extubated. The patient has been treated with aggressive diuretics and a 7-day course of antibiotics. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation using a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms indicate a COPD flare-up, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an underlying infection or inflammatory response. However, the patient is asymptomatic and cultures have been negative, indicating no active infection.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is within normal limits but may be maintained at higher rates to compensate for the presence of mitral regurgitation (MR). This could potentially lead to cardiac complications if not monitored closely.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with current medications. However, close monitoring is necessary to ensure continued management of hypertension.

5. History of CAD with previous myocardial infarctions: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk for future cardiac events such as angina or myocardial infarction.

6. Gastritis: The patient has a history of gastritis and is being"
