   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on esmolol drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of reintubation/extubation
   and ERCP, now found to have collapsed lung, all of  which may have been
   stressors.  With development of fever overnight, there may also be an
   infectious component.  [**Month (only) 8**] also consider volume depletion given recent
   hx of poor PO intake.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  No
   underlying pulmonary disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - pt refused PO meds o/n, therefore started on dilt gtt, changed to
   esmolol gtt with improved rate control and conversion to sinus rhythm
   - episode of hypotension overnight (SBP in the high 70s), esmolol
   d/c
   - consider echo in the AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue tachycardia with IVF, pain control, treatment for possible
   infection
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - will continue maintenance fluids 125 cc D51/2NS.
   - urine output has remained >30 cc/h
   - Place on telemetry
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR this AM (unable to obtain last night due to agitation)
   showed collapsed lung/atelectasis, likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, possible aspiration pneumonia
   vs. pneumonitis given recent fever but not evident on CXR.
   - initially had increased O2 requirement, but now satting high 90s on
   NRB.  Frequently takes off mask voluntarily.
   - chest PT, patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - positive pressure noninvasive mask
   - talk to mother today, consider bronch should conservative management
   fail
   - follow CXR tomorrow AM
   - abg unable to obtain due to inability to hold still
   .
   # fever/leukocytosis: spike to 101.1 overnight.  Pending CBC for this
   AM.  Source of infection unclear, but possibilities include post-op
   atelectasis/collapse, post-ERCP seeding, aspiration pneumonia.
   Initially on presentation was afebrile with no leukocytosis, but spiked
   to 101.1 overnight.  Currently afebrile with pending CBC.  Concern for
   post-ERCP seeding, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis given
   intubation/extubation.
   - Was started on Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h this AM
   (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - development of hypotension possible secondary to esmolol gtt, but
   concern for development of sepsis
   - IV access is failing, currently with one fickle IV; talk to mother
   regarding PICC line vs. CVL
   - pending blood cx from [**8-29**]; urine cx pending
   - no diarrhea
   - likely will need peripheral IV change
   - repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   - IVF as above
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - continue trending LFTs, bilirubin, alk phos.  Monitor for improvement
   in markers s/p ERCP.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology following; post ERCP recommend NPO overnight with IVF.
   [**Month (only) 8**] advance diet in the AM.  Consider cholecystectomy in the future.
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazeoan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.
   - ammonia levels on [**8-24**]: 84 (elevated).  Continue to monitor.
   - aspiration precautions
   .
   #. FEN: dysphagia diet (taking great POs), monitor lytes, IVF to
   maintain SBP
   .
   #. PPx: SC Heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #. Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP

   Disposition: ICU today
","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut syndrome, recurrent prostatitis, cerebral palsy, cardiomyopathy, and aspiration pneumonia in the past. The patient was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient has been on esmolol drip and is hemodynamically stable. However, overnight, the patient developed fever, hypotension, and an irregularly irregular heart rate. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been started due to suspected infection. 

The patient also has a collapsed lung, which may be secondary to trauma during intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, or possible aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis. 

The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin, which could be a result of the recent ERCP procedure. 

The patient's mental status is at baseline, but there are concerns about possible encephalopathy due to toxic/metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis. 

The patient has a history of allergies to cephalosporins and proton pump inhibitors, among others. 

The patient's current medications include diltiazem, esmolol, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, dilantin, and morphine sulfate. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut syndrome, recurrent prostatitis, cerebral palsy, cardiomyopathy, and aspiration pneumonia in the past. He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and underwent an ERCP procedure. Currently, he is on diltiazem drip and is hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR, which occurred during reintubation/extubation and ERCP. There may also be an infectious component contributing to the fever. The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus tachycardia.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has a collapsed lung/atelectasis likely secondary to trauma from intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, or possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient initially had increased O2 requirements but is now saturating in the high 90s on 6L NC.
3. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient had a spike in temperature to 101.1 overnight. The source of infection is unclear, but possibilities include post-op atelectasis/collapse, post-ERCP seeding, or aspiration pneumonia.
4. Transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bilirubin: The patient underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy, showing an impacted stone in the major papilla and successful removal of over 10 gallstones. Hepatic cholestasis may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
5. Questionable encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is at baseline with no reported changes. An EEG suggested encephalopathy, but it is unlikely related to seizure activity and may be due to toxic/metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis.

Overall, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications, including atrial fibrillation with RVR, hypoxia, fever/leukocytosis, transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bilirubin, and questionable encephalopathy."

   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no
   clinical evident seizures. There was a lot of interictal activity both
   in a generalized and multifocal distribution. The background activity
   was slow suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy. In addition, there
   were periods of more rhythmic activity mostly bifrontal in distribution
   which may represent subclinical seizures
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on diltiazem drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of extubation and ERCP,
   which may have been stressors.  No underlying cardiac or pulmonary
   disease.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  Unlikely infectious
   etiology, given lack of leukocytosis, fever, and clear CXR.  Appears
   dry, may be volume depleted.
   - Has received diltiazem IV push with mild efficacy.
   - Due to question of ability to take PO meds, begun on diltiazem gtt
   with mild decrease in HR.  Will need to add PO dilt, but question of
   adequate PO intake.
   - added esmolol gtt with conversion to sinus rhythm.  Unfortunately,
   due to transient hypotension with BP in 70s, was held.  Has remained in
   sinus rhythm with rate in the low 100s.
   - echo in the AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - Place on telemetry
   .
   # hypoxia: initially on presentation was afebrile with no leukocytosis,
   but there was low threshold to start abx with concern for post-ERCP
   seeding, sepsis.  Also concern for possible aspiration pneumonia vs.
   pneumonitis given intubation/extubation X 2.  Consider aspiration
   pneumonia secondary to intubation X 2.

   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - continue trending LFTs, bilirubin, alk phos.  Monitor for improvement

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which showed impacted stones in the biliary tree. The stones were successfully removed using a sphincterotome and balloon sweep.

Since admission, the patient has experienced several medical complications. He developed hypoxia initially but now has stable oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula. The patient also had a fever spike to 101.1 degrees overnight, and blood and urine cultures were obtained. He was started on antibiotics (Cipro and Flagyl) due to concerns of post-ERCP seeding, sepsis, or aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating transaminitis, increased alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. This may be related to the recent ERCP procedure or medication side effects.

The patient's seizure activity appears to be at baseline, and he is being monitored closely for any changes in mental status. Ammonia levels were elevated, suggesting possible encephalopathy, which could be due to toxic/metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis.

The patient has allergies to cephalosporins and penicillins, and his code status is DNR/DNI. He is currently on diltiazem drip and is hemodynamically stable. The patient's current medications include Dil"

    - ERCP [**8-28**]: Impacted stone in the major papilla.
     * Many round stones ranging in size from 4mm to 5mm were seen in the
       biliary tree, in the common bile duct, the cystic duct and the
       gallbladder.
     * One stone was seen at the origin of the left intrahepatic duct.
     * A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
       sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
     * The impacted stone was released following sphincterotomy
     * Multiple (>10) stones were successfully extracted using a 11.5 mm
       RX balloon, requiring multiple balloon sweeps for clearance
     * The stone in the left intrahepatic duct was extracted successfully
       using a 4mm Hurricane balloon.
     * The intrahepatic duct and common bile duct were clear at the end of
       the procedure
     * Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
   - CXR: [**8-24**]: cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable and
   unchanged from previous study.  The hila appeared normal bilaterally.
   Lung fields are clear.  No evidence of pleural effusion or PTX.
   -EEG: [**8-27**]:
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no
   clinical evident seizures. There was a lot of interictal activity both
   in a generalized and multifocal distribution. The background activity
   was slow suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy. In addition, there
   were periods of more rhythmic activity mostly bifrontal in distribution
   which may represent subclinical seizures
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on diltiazem drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of extubation and ERCP,
   which may have been stressors.  No underlying cardiac or pulmonary
   disease.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  Unlikely infectious
   etiology, given lack of leukocytosis, fever, and clear CXR.  Appears
   dry, may be volume depleted.
   - Has received diltiazem IV push with mild efficacy.
   - Due to question of ability to take PO meds, begun on diltiazem gtt
   with mild decrease in HR.  Will need to add PO dilt, but question of
   adequate PO intake.
   - added esmolol gtt with conversion to sinus rhythm.  Unfortunately,
   due to transient hypotension with BP in 70s, was held.  Has remained in
   sinus rhythm with rate in the low 100s.
   - echo in the AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - Place on telemetry

   # hypoxia: initially on presentation was afebrile with no leukocytosis,
   but there was low threshold to start abx with concern for post-ERCP
   seeding, sepsis.  Also concern for possible aspiration pneumonia vs.
   pneumonitis given intubation/extubation X 2.  Consider aspiration
   pneumonia secondary to intubation X 2.

   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - continue trending LFTs, bilirubin, alk phos.  Monitor for improvement
   in markers s/p ERCP.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He underwent an ERCP procedure for gallstones in the biliary tree and is now experiencing multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's temperature spiked to 101.1 degrees overnight, and he has an elevated white blood cell count. This may indicate an infection, possibly related to the recent ERCP procedure or aspiration pneumonia.

2. Hypoxia: The patient initially had increased oxygen requirements, but is now maintaining high 90s oxygen saturation on 6 liters nasal cannula. There is concern for post-ERCP seeding, sepsis, or aspiration pneumonia.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's heart rhythm has been unstable, and he has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was initially on diltiazem drip, which provided some stability, but then converted to sinus rhythm with esmolol gtt. However, due to transient hypotension, the esmolol gtt was held.

4. Transaminitis and Increased Alkaline Phosphatase/Total Bilirubin: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal following the ERCP procedure, which included a sphincterotomy. This could be due to hepatic ch"

   had cholelithiasis driving cholecystitis and following ERCP with
   substantial stone removal had re-intubation with ventilatory failure
   complicated by evolution of Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular
   response.  His course overnight was complicated by hyptension, fever
   and hypoxia but with conversion to sinus rhythm.
   1)Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia-Initial failure was likely related to
   medication effects but now has substantial post operative
   atelectasis
this may be related to fever in addition to the hypoxia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient is a 35-year-old male with [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gestaut syndrome, initially admitted for prostatitis. He had cholelithiasis leading to cholecystitis, and following an ERCP with substantial stone removal, he required re-intubation due to ventilatory failure, which was complicated by the development of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's course overnight was complicated by hypotension, fever, and hypoxia but eventually converted to sinus rhythm. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure/hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gestaut, and cholelithiasis with cholecystitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:

1. Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia: The patient has substantial post-operative atelectasis contributing to his respiratory failure. This may be related to his fever as well. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation, incentive spirometry, bronchoscopy if necessary, and chest PT are being considered for management.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation in an acute setting during re-intubation. Adequate volume maintenance, continuing with PRN rate control, longer-term follow-up of E"

   # hypoxia: continued to have oxygen sats in the mid to high 90s.  CXR
   yesterday showed left sided pleural effusion and lower lobe and lingula
   collapse.  Likely secondary to trauma regarding intubation/extubation,
   barotrauma, pain.
   - satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off mask
   voluntarily.
   - continue chest PT, patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive
   spirometry
   - try  intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask
   - consider bronch should conservative management fail
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension

   # fever/leukocytosis/hypotension: gram positive cocci in clusters found
   growing in his blood.  Spike to 101.2 overnight in conjunction with
   rising WBC.  Source of infection unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of skin
   breakdown.  Concern for urinary source and VRE given history of
   prostatitis, post-ERCP seeding, introduction through the skin given
   difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - grew gram positive cocci in clusters in his blood
   - follow urine and blood cultures for speciation
   - started on vancomycin 1g q12 hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Was started on Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h this AM
   (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - unable to place PICC line.  Has 2 peripheral IVs.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   - IVF boluses

   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of reintubation/extubation
   and ERCP, now found to have partial lung collapse and gram positive
   cocci in clusters growing in his blood, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - continues to be in sinus, rate in the low 100s
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - episodes of hypotension responded well to IV boluses with goal > 90
   - consider echo this  AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - urine output has remained robust >30 cc/h

   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs; duct has been
   cleared so should start to fall, if continues to rise, will discuss
   about possible stent insertion but this discussion is premature at this

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever of 101.2°F, indicating an underlying infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension with blood pressure in the 80s, which responded well to a normal saline bolus. This could be due to sepsis or volume depletion.
3. Blood culture: The blood culture grew gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a bacterial infection. Vancomycin was started for coverage, but the source of infection is unclear.
4. Respiratory support: The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for oxygen support and has a history of left-sided pleural effusion and lower lobe collapse, possibly secondary to trauma during intubation/extubation, barotrauma, or pain.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may be related to reintubation/extubation and ERCP. It is being treated with IV fluids and antibiotics.
6. Jaundice: The patient has jaundice, which may be due to hepatic cholestasis from medication or gallstones.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28. It is normocytic and suggests anemia of chronic disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure for gallstones in the biliary tree and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

24-hour events:
- The patient had a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
- There was difficulty obtaining access, and a PICC line attempt was unsuccessful. A second peripheral IV was inserted.
- The patient was found to be hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 80s, received a 1-liter normal saline bolus, and responded well.
- Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a possible infection. Vancomycin was started at 1 gram IV every 12 hours.
- The patient's neurologic status is unchanged from admission.
- Hepatology signed off.
- The ERCP recommendations include continuing to watch the bilirubin levels, as the duct has been cleared, and discussing possible stent insertion if the bilirubin continues to rise.
- The patient is on maintenance fluids and is NPO (nothing by mouth).
- Allergies include cefaclor, cefuroxime, lansoprazole, red dye, phenylalanine, cephalosporins, and proton pump inhibitors.

   Pending urine culture [**8-29**]
   MRSA ([**8-29**]): Positive
   CXR: ([**8-29**]) :
   The lower half of the left hemithorax is uniformly opacified, and there
   is a
   sharp cutoff to the lumen of the left main bronchus at the level of the
   upper
   lobe origin. Some of the opacification is due to left pleural effusion
   and
   some, given the absence of rightward mediastinal shift, is due to lower
   lobe
   and lingular collapse. Right lung is clear. Cardiac size cannot be
   assessed.
   Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5888**] at the time of
   dictation.
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Spike to 101.2 overnight in
   conjunction with rising WBC.  Source of infection likely biliary source
   s/p ERCP, but concern for urinary source and VRE given history of
   prostatitis, introduction through the skin given difficulty with Ivs,
   aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - follow urine and blood cultures for speciation
   - continue on day 2 of vancomycin 1g q12 hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 2 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - will obtain echo today
   - unable to place PICC line.  Has 2 peripheral IVs.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - robust urine output
   .
   # hypoxia: continued to have oxygen sats in the mid to high 90s.  CXR
   yesterday showed left sided pleural effusion and lower lobe and lingula
   atelectasis.  Likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain.
   - satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off mask
   voluntarily.
   - continue chest PT to mobilize secretions, patient will unlikely
   cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - continue with antibiotics
   - trial with intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask
   unsuccessful
   - consider bronch should conservative management fail
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of acute disease -
   reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have partial lung
   collapse and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - continues to be in sinus, rate in the low 100s
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - episodes of hypotension responded well to IV boluses with goal SBP >
   90
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - urine output has remained robust >30 cc/h
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward with the exeption of t bili.  Remains
   jaundiced.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs; duct has been
   cleared so should start to fall, if continues to rise, will discuss
   about possible stent insertion but this discussion is premature at this
   point.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with RVR and atelectasis.
- The patient has developed several medical complications:
   1. Fever - 101.2: The patient had a fever spike overnight in conjunction with rising WBC count. The source of infection is likely the biliary source s/p ERCP, but there is concern for urinary source and VRE given the history of prostatitis, introduction through the skin due to difficulty with IV access, and aspiration pneumonia due to intubation/extubation.
   2. Hypoxia: The patient continues to have oxygen saturation in the mid to high 90s. CXR showed left-sided pleural effusion and lower lobe and lingula atelectasis, which may be secondary to trauma regarding intubation/extubation, barotrauma, or pain.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): Occurred in the setting of acute disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP. Now found to have partial lung collapse and MRSA bacteremia, all of which may have been contributors. No known history of atrial fibrillation in the past.

","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of intractable seizures, gallstones, and a recent course of ERCP complicated by atrial fibrillation and atelectasis. The patient's condition has been complicated by cholecystitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently being treated with Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl for a likely biliary source of infection. 

The patient's fever is being monitored, and there is ongoing concern for atrial fibrillation seen in the setting of acute illness. The patient's seizure disorder is also being managed with Keppra. 

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is on high flow neb and oxygen delivery device, with an ABG showing a pH of 7.25. The patient's chest X-ray shows significant areas of collapse and effusion. 

The patient's nutritional status is being managed by keeping him NPO due to altered mental status and tenuous respiratory status. 

The patient's lines include a 22-gauge and a 20-gauge, both inserted on different dates. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF Heparin and stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor. 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

   Disposition: ICU today
","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atelectasis. He underwent an ERCP for gallstones in the biliary tree and has since developed multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to gram-positive MRSA bacteremia. The source of infection is likely from the biliary source following the ERCP procedure, but there is also concern for a urinary source and VRE given his history of prostatitis. The patient has allergies to cephalosporins and penicillins, so alternative antibiotics are being used.

2. Hypoxia: The patient continues to experience hypoxia with oxygen saturations in the mid-to-high 90s. A chest X-ray shows left-sided lung collapse, suggesting atelectasis. Previous attempts at chest physiotherapy and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have been unsuccessful. The patient is now being considered for a bronchoscopy if conservative management fails.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (a.fib with RVR): The patient developed atrial fibrillation with RVR during the reintubation/extubation process and subsequent ERCP. This may be related to acute disease, volume depletion, or underlying cardiomyopathy. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with a rate in the low 100s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a past medical history of Gastaut syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones, and transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with right ventricular overload and atelectasis. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to gram MRSA bacteremia, temperature did not spike as high overnight, currently afebrile, with downtrending WBC. The source of infection is likely the biliary source s/p ERCP, but concern for urinary source and VRE given history of prostatitis, introduction through the skin given difficulty with IVs, aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Temperature did not spike as high
   overnight, currently afebrile, with downtrending WBC.  Source of
   infection likely biliary source s/p ERCP, but concern for urinary
   source and VRE given history of prostatitis, introduction through the
   skin given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given
   intubation/extubation.
   - follow urine cultures
   - continue on day 3 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 3 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR this AM appears worse with white out of the left lung,
   suggest atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, potential effusion.
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - chest PT to mobilize secretions does not appear to be improving
   condition, patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - trial with intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask
   unsuccessful
   - s/p bronchoscopy today; repeat CXR did not show improvement in CXR.
   Follow BAL analysis.
   - will pursue CT to help differentiate atelectasis vs effusion
   - continue with antibiotics
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of acute disease -
   reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have partial lung
   collapse and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - repeat a fib overnight, given IVF boluses to maintain SBP, rate
   controlled on dilt gtt
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - episodes of hypotension responded well to IV boluses with goal SBP >
   90
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - urine output has remained robust >30 cc/h
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs.  Trending down and
   no need for ercp given downtrending results
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atelectasis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure for gallstones in the biliary tree. He is currently on day 3 of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole due to gram MRSA bacteremia. The source of infection is suspected to be biliary or urinary. The patient also has hypoxia with worsening left-sided lung collapse, anemia of chronic disease, transaminitis, increased alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin, and a questionable encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has gram MRSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not effectively treated.
2. Pneumonia: The worsening left-sided lung collapse suggests the possibility of pneumonia, which may be aspiration pneumonia due to intubation/extubation.
3. Endocarditis: Although the echo does not suggest endocarditis, the presence of MRSA bacteremia raises concern for this condition.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's urine output needs to be closely monitored, as there is a potential risk for urinary tract infection or acute kidney injury.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin indicate possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo male with history of seizure disorder and with cholelithiasis and
   now admitted to ICU with A-fib, hypoxemia and atelectatsis.   He does
   have persistent elevation in bilirubin through to today concerning for
   persistent obstruction but with (Ap-342 (477), T. Bili 10.8 (11.2)).
   some trend down in liver associated enzymes that have remained
   elevated.  It is very concerning that the patient has had progression
   of complete collapse of left lung.
   1) CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
He has some markers of improvement (WBC
   down, transaminases down), but additional markers such as T. Bili and
   Alk Phos which have been slow to decline
   -Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl to continue
   -Will consult with ERCP to consider timing of repeat intervention
   -If ERCP pursued will  need intubation
at which time intubation would
   be required
   2)Hypoxemia--Due to Atelectasis
this is persistent and severe and
   progressive from 2 days ago.  We are limited in terms of being able to
   recruit patient effort and compliance with interventions such as chest
   PT and cough.  We will have to consider nasal trumpet, [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-tracheal
   suctioning, positioning as possible.
   -If intubated for procedrue will pursue bronchoscopy

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, cholelithiasis, and now admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, hypoxemia, and atelectasis. He has persistent elevation in bilirubin, which is concerning for persistent obstruction. There is a progression of complete collapse of the left lung, and markers of improvement such as WBC and transaminases are down, but T. Bili and Alk Phos have been slow to decline.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cholecystitis Calculus: The patient may develop further complications related to gallstones, such as cholecystitis.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's severe and progressive atelectasis is causing persistent hypoxemia. Interventions such as nasal trumpet, tracheal suctioning, positioning, and potentially bronchoscopy will be considered to improve oxygenation.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient's seizure disorder should be managed with appropriate anti-seizure medication.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension overnight requiring fluid bolus.
5. Fever: The patient has a persistent low-grade fever.
6. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's AFib should be monitored and managed appropriately.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure needs to be closely monitored and managed with mechanical ventilation if necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Temperature did not spike as high
   overnight, currently afebrile, with downtrending WBC.  Source of
   infection may be from pneumonia or biliary source s/p ERCP, also
   concern for urinary source and VRE given history of prostatitis and
   introduction through the skin given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration
   pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - follow urine cultures
   - continue on day 4 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 4 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - required to start levophed this AM
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output, which has dwindled down
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - s/p bronchoscopy yesterday; repeat CXR did not show improvement in
   CXR.  Follow BAL analysis.
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of acute disease -
   reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have partial lung
   collapse and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - repeat a fib overnight, given IVF boluses to maintain SBP, rate
   controlled on dilt gtt
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - given 2.5L IVF, but ultimately had to initiate levophed
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs.  Trending down and
   no need for ercp given downtrending results
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

   Disposition: ICU today
","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and atelectasis. The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Sepsis: The patient has gram-positive MRSA bacteremia, which may be the source of infection. The temperature did not spike overnight, indicating a potential decrease in infection severity. The WBC count is also trending downward, which suggests a positive response to treatment. The source of infection could be from pneumonia or biliary sources due to recent ERCP, as well as urinary and VRE given a history of prostatitis and skin introduction.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's CXR shows complete opacification of the left lung with a medium-sized pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia. There are also focal airspace opacities at the right lung base, which could be due to aspiration or focal pneumonia. The patient is currently on oxygen, and bronchoscopy did not show improvement in the CXR. Antibiotics should be continued, and further evaluation of the pleural effusion is needed.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with RVR, which occurred in the setting of acute disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP. The partial lung collapse and MRSA bacteremia may have contributed"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - bronch performed, clear airways.  CXR showed little improvement.
   - ordered CT: Complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - BAL results: no organisms, no pmns on gram stain.  Polys: 91, bands:
   2, lymphs: 1, monos: 0, eos: 1, macro: 5
   - at 9:30PM, went back into a fib with RVR in 150s, pushed metoprolol
   5mg X 3.  1L NS Bolus given.  Rate fluctuating between 110s-130s.
   Placed on esmolol gtt with HR in 130s.  Rate controlled on dilt gtt,
   but still a. fib.  Given 2.5L IVF over course of night in attempt to
   keep SBP >90.
   - at 6:30 AM, started on levophed bc SBP in the 70s not responding to
   fluids.  A line was placed.
   - ERCP recs: because AP is trending down, monitor bili trend.
   Cholestatic process seems to be getting better. If levels remain to
   decrease, ERCP most likely not needed.

","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atelectasis. The patient has been experiencing sepsis due to gram MRSA bacteremia, which may have originated from pneumonia or a biliary source post-ERCP, as well as potential urinary and vascular sources. The patient's infection control measures include continuing on day 4 of vancomycin 1g q8h, and a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h.

The patient also has hypoxia, likely secondary to atelectasis or pneumonia, with a complete opacification of the left lung and a medium-sized pleural effusion. Focal airspace opacities at the right lung base are also present, which could be due to aspiration or focal pneumonia. Antibiotics will be continued as above, and intubation will be maintained for at least another 24 hours.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response occurred in the setting of acute disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP. This may have contributed to the development of atrial fibrillation. Measures for controlling the heart rate include IV fluids boluses to maintain blood pressure, and rate-controlled on diltiazem.

The patient has transaminitis, increased alkaline phosphatase/total"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a medical history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and atelectasis. He underwent an ERCP procedure for gallstones in the biliary tree and is now experiencing multiple complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has gram MRSA bacteremia, which may be a source of infection from pneumonia or biliary sources post-ERCP. There is also concern for urinary and VRE sources due to a history of prostatitis and introduction through the skin.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's left lung is completely opacified with a medium-sized pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia. Focal airspace opacities at the right lung base could be due to aspiration or focal pneumonia.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient had recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR overnight, which were controlled with diltiazem. This may be related to acute disease, reintubation/extubation, and ERCP.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, increased alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin due to recent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone removal. Hepatic cholestasis may also be secondary to medication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, admitted with gallstones and now experiencing respiratory failure due to volume loss on the left side. The patient has returned to atrial fibrillation and requires invasive ventilation. The patient has allergies to certain medications and has been given various antibiotics. The patient is currently on several ICU medications including midazolam, fentanyl, diltiazem, and norepinephrine.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation started on August 31, 01:50 PM, bronchoscopy performed on August 31, 04:30 PM, PICC line insertion on August 31, 08:00 PM, EKG at 10:00 PM on August 31, and arterial line insertion on September 1, 06:47 AM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Flowsheet data indicates fluid balance with a total input of 5,536 mL and output of 2,995 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,541 mL. Respiratory support includes ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 60, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, likely caused by aspiration pneumonia. The patient underwent invasive ventilation and bronchoscopy. She also received multiple IV medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. The patient's allergies include cefaclor, cefuroxime, lansoprazole, red dye, aspartame, phenylalanine, cephalosporins, and proton pump inhibitors. She has received various antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

24-hour events include starting invasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, PICC line placement, EKG, and arterial line placement. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and low potassium. Other lab results are within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas reveals a pH of 7.42, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 228, and respiratory system compliance index of 60.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly individual with a history of seizure disorder, admitted to the ICU for gallstones and now experiencing respiratory failure due to volume loss on the left side. The patient has returned to atrial fibrillation (AF), and their allergies include Ceclor (Cefaclor), Cefuroxime, Prevacid (Lansoprazole), Red Dye, Phenylalanine, and Cephalosporins. The patient is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, diltiazem, norepinephrine, metoprolol, and heparin sodium. The patient's medical and family history, review of systems, and flow sheet data are unchanged from admission except as noted above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to volume loss on the left side. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed through ventilation support and careful fluid management.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has returned to AF, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat and potential complications such as blood clots, stroke, or heart failure. The patient is being treated with a diltiazem drip to manage the AF.

3. Bacteremia: The patient is on vancomycin, suggesting a suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. It is important to continue antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for any signs of worsening infection or se"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of seizure disorder, gallstones, and recent respiratory failure due to volume loss on the left side. She has returned to atrial fibrillation and requires invasive ventilation. The patient's allergies include Cefaclor, Cefuroxime, Lansoprazole, Red Dye, Phenylalanine, Cephalosporins, and Aspartame. She has been on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, diltiazem, norepinephrine, metoprolol, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with decreased breath sounds on the left lung. The physical examination reveals jaundice and irregular heart rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and requires invasive ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause is not addressed.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has returned to atrial fibrillation, which can lead to ineffective cardiac output and potential complications such as embolic events.

3. Volume Loss: The patient's hypotension may be due to volume loss on"

","Summary:
The patient is an ICU admitted individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently on mechanical ventilation and pressors for hypotension. The patient has a history of cholecystitis, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency, seizure disorder, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, except for the heart rate which is elevated at 115 bpm. The patient's chest CT shows near complete left lung consolidation and small bilateral effusions. The patient's lab results indicate anemia and some abnormalities in liver enzymes and electrolytes. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments for their conditions, including antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, and cardiac support. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and chest CT findings of lung consolidation suggest a risk of infection. This could lead to sepsis or pneumonia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and stroke. Managing this condition and maintaining normal heart rhythm is crucial.
4. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's recent development of renal insufficiency may require adjustment of medications and close monitoring of kidney function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU. They have been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including cholecystitis, hypotension, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency, seizure, respiratory failure, anemia, coagulopathy, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is receiving supportive care, antibiotics, and other medications for their conditions. They are also being closely monitored for any changes in their vital signs and lab results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia and a near complete left lung consolidation seen on chest CT. This indicates a high risk of infection spreading to other parts of the body.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if they do not improve on the ventilator settings or if they develop further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is impaired, which can lead to further deterioration if not managed properly.
4. Coagulopathy: The rising INR suggests a coagulation disorder, which could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Seizure: The patient has experienced a seizure, and there is a possibility of recurrent seizures if the underlying cause is not addressed.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, and it is important to monitor"

","The patient's condition appears to be critical and unstable. They are currently on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating possible hypotension. The chest CT shows near complete left lung consolidation, suggesting a severe infection or pneumonia. There are also small bilateral effusions present.

The patient has a history of bacteremia, for which they are being treated with vancomycin. There is ongoing respiratory failure with a need for mechanical ventilation. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on a diltiazem drip, which is being weaned as possible.

There are several new complications that have arisen, including cholecystitis, renal insufficiency, anemia, coagulopathy, and a recent seizure without status epilepticus. The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and low urine output.

The patient's current treatment plan includes supportive care for cholecystitis, weaning off pressors and IV fluids as tolerated, continuing antibiotics for bacteremia and respiratory failure, and managing atrial fibrillation by weaning the diltiazem drip. The patient's ICU care includes nutritional support with a pulmonary formula, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunctions and requires close monitoring and aggressive management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He is currently admitted to the ICU and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, bacteremia, cholecystitis, hypotension, renal insufficiency, respiratory failure, anemia, and seizures. He is receiving various medications including pressors, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives. His vital signs are within normal limits except for an elevated heart rate of 115 bpm. The patient's fluid balance and respiratory support are also being closely monitored. The chest CT shows near complete left lung consolidation with small bilateral effusions. Lab results indicate some abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory failure may increase the risk of further infections.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current use of pressors may predispose him to develop other cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's renal insufficiency and abnormal liver function tests suggest potential organ dysfunction, which can lead to further complications.
4. Pulmonary complications: The near complete left lung consolidation seen on the chest CT indicates a significant pulmonary infection, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure.
5. Bleeding: The prolonged PT/PTT/"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, seizure disorder, and anemia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and antiepileptic drugs.

24-hour events include the administration of various antibiotics, insertion of arterial and peripheral IV lines, and changes in the patient's vital signs. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but his blood pressure is low and he has tachycardia. His oxygen saturation remains stable at 98%. The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure and requires ongoing ventilatory support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests. His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low, indicating ongoing anemia. The patient's electrolyte levels are relatively stable, except for slightly low magnesium.

The patient's condition is being managed with supportive care, including nutritional support through enteral feeding. The medical team is closely monitoring the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and medication administration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing dependence on mechanical ventilation indicates acute respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and the presence of bacter"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Small left pleural effusion with complete opacification of the left
   lung
   with patent airways, could be due to aspiration or pneumonia. Please
   correlate with clinical symptoms. Mild focal opacities at the right
   lung base
   are noted as well. Please correlate with clinical symptoms.
   2. Gallstones, and trace ascites in the abdomen.
   CXR: white out of left lung
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Source of infection may be from
   pneumonia or biliary source s/p ERCP, also concern for urinary source
   and VRE given history of prostatitis and introduction through the skin
   given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given
   intubation/extubation.
   - continue on day 5 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**]) ->
   however, Vanc trough was high, will d/c for now and recheck level
   before giving another dose
   - Continue day 5 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - continue levophed, will attempt to wean
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output
   - follow cultures
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.  Remains intubated.
   - continue mechanical ventilation -> wean to PS [**4-22**] today
   - f/u cultures
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   - keep left side up
   .
   # ARF: Cr bumped up to 2.4 up from 0.7.  Diff incl prerenal, intrinsic,
   postrenal, most likely intrinsic (ATN) from hypotension and A fib
   w/RVR.
   - urine lytes
   - continue to monitor
   - consider renal c/s in future
   .
   # A fib with RVR: currently back on dilt gtt, in low 100s.   Will
   attempt to wean today if tolerated.  Occurred in the setting of acute
   disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have left
   lung consolidation and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - give IVF boluses as needed
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now stable around 24.
   Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   - hemolysis labs wnl
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continue at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   - Neuro will see pt is there are any active Neuro issues
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Afebrile overnight, with downtrending
   WBC.  Source of infection may be from pneumonia or biliary source s/p
   ERCP, also concern for urinary source and VRE given history of
   prostatitis and introduction through the skin given difficulty with
   Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - continue on day 4 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 4 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - required to start levophed this AM due to SBPs in the 70s.  Will
   attempt to wean.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output, which has dwindled down
   - follow cultures
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.  Remains intubated.
   - will stay intubated for at least 24 hours in the setting of
   aggressive diuresis last night and evolving consolidation
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - s/p bronchoscopy yesterday with clear airways; repeat CXR did not
   show improvement in CXR.  Follow BAL analysis.
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   - keep left side up
   - maintain intubation for at least another 24 hours till we get a
   better picture with his septic picture.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  re-occurred overnight.  Currently rate controlled on
   dilt gtt.  Will attempt to wean today if tolerated.  Occurred in the
   setting of acute disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found
   to have left  lung consolidation and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may
   have been contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause
   given his recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - was given IVF boluses to maintain SBP, rate controlled on dilt gtt
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - given 2.5L IVF, but ultimately had to initiate levophed
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs.  Trending down and
   no need for ercp given downtrending results
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.

   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter

   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atelectasis. He underwent an ERCP procedure for gallstones in the biliary tree. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia, likely originating from pneumonia or biliary source post-ERCP. He also has hypoxia due to left lung atelectasis or aspiration pneumonia, and transaminitis with increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin following the ERCP procedure. The patient's anemia is normocytic and likely due to anemia of chronic disease. He has Gastaut syndrome, and there are concerns about encephalopathy potentially related to cholestatic hepatitis. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. His blood pressure is managed with norepinephrine, and he is receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. His current medications include fentanyl, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia. Continued monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and left lung atelectasis pose a risk for respiratory failure. Maintaining"

   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Source of infection may be from
   pneumonia or biliary source s/p ERCP, also concern for urinary source
   and VRE given history of prostatitis and introduction through the skin
   given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given
   intubation/extubation.
   - continue on day 5 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**]) ->

   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - continue levophed, will attempt to wean.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output
   - follow cultures
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.  Remains intubated.

   - f/u cultures
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   - keep left side up

   # A fib with RVR: currently back on dilt gtt, in low 100s.   Will
   attempt to wean today if tolerated.  Occurred in the setting of acute
   disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have left
   lung consolidation and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - give IVF boluses as needed
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atelectasis. He underwent an ERCP procedure for gallstones in the biliary tree. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and is also experiencing sepsis, acute kidney injury, anemia, and transaminitis. He has a MRSA bacteremia, likely from pneumonia or biliary source post-ERCP. There is also a concern for urinary source and VRE given his history of prostatitis and introduction through the skin. Aspiration pneumonia is also a concern due to intubation/extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently septic with MRSA bacteremia, which may be due to pneumonia or biliary source post-ERCP. There is also a concern for urinary source and VRE.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.7 to 3.6, suggesting intrinsic renal injury, possibly due to hypotension and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
3. Hypoxia: The patient continues to show signs of hypoxia, as evidenced by the whiteout of the left lung on the chest X-ray, suggesting atelectasis/collapse, likely secondary to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo male with [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gestaut syndrome now with admittion with
   cholelithiasis and obstruction with resulting cholecystitis now with
   worsening respiratory status with atelectasis and collapse of left lung
   seen requiring intubation and bronchoscopy.  Now he has persistent and
   worsening sepsis from likely from pulmonary source and this is now
   complicated by worsening renal failure through to this morning.  This
   represents a substantial and persistent worsening despite optimal
   efforts to support patient in the setting of acute illness
he has had
   cholecystitis initially but now with Staph Sepsis and persistence of
   substantial multi-lobar pneumonia.
   Patient had quality of life which had moved to a poor quality and not
   of a level that patient or his mother would continue to consider worth
   living
and this was before the acute illness.  With the evolution of
   significant and persistent insult of sepsis and respiratory failure
   patient has expected prolonged course with intubation, concern for need
   for tracheostomy and with the possibility of not being able to return
   to previous
unacceptable baseline the patient
s mother would request
   specifically that we move to CMO given likely prolonged course and
   limited expectation of being able to return to previous functional
   status.

Significant pneumonia and consolidation and
   having need for ongoing A/C support and pneumonia treatment.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gestaut syndrome who was admitted with cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. He now presents with worsening respiratory status, sepsis from a likely pulmonary source, and worsening renal failure. Despite optimal supportive care, the patient's condition has persisted and substantially worsened. The patient's quality of life is poor, and his mother does not believe he would consider living with this level of illness. Given the prolonged course and limited expectation of returning to previous functional status, the patient's mother has requested comfort measures only (CMO) status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has significant pneumonia and consolidation, requiring ongoing assisted ventilation support and pneumonia treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis with a pulmonary source, leading to persistent hypotension.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient initially presented with cholecystitis, but lab studies are improving.
4. Seizure Disorder: The patient had a seizure, and treatment with Keppra has been initiated.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis with pre-renal insult. Renal function has been refractory to support thus far.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive analysis."
