","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and recent hypoxia. The patient was admitted for hypertensive urgency and later transferred to the MICU due to new dysarthric speech. 

The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation at 7 am. She is currently on BiPAP with persistent hypoxia. The chest X-ray shows severe pulmonary edema, and a thoracentesis has been planned today. 

The patient is also experiencing delirium/encephalopathy, with acute delirium and a CT scan negative for any acute intra-cranial process. The etiology of the delirium is unclear, but possible explanations include infection, metabolic derangement, or medication effect. 

The patient's hypertension is still present, with pressures ranging from 170-180 systolic and 120 post-intubation. The plan is to wean off anti-hypertensives to a goal of 160 on labetalol. 

Additionally, the patient has bilateral pleural effusions, with possible etiologies including heart failure exacerbation or malignant effusion. A thoracentesis has been performed, and further evaluation will be done through CXR's. 

The patient also has a history of a thyroid nodule, with most recent FNA inconclusive due to insufficient sample. The nodule appeared benign on [**212"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and recent hypoxia. She presented with headaches, hypertension, and new dysarthric speech, leading to transfer to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated at 7 am. She also exhibits acute delirium, severe pulmonary edema, and bilateral pleural effusions. Other medical conditions include type 2 diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, and a thyroid nodule with inconclusive FNA results.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia despite being on BiPAP may progress to more severe respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Delirium: The patient's acute delirium needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications such as falls, worsening agitation, or increased risk of infection.
3. Severe pulmonary edema: The presence of severe pulmonary edema may indicate heart failure exacerbation or other underlying causes. Proper management is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions: The possible etiologies include heart failure exacerbation, malignant effusion, or other causes. Thoracentesis and further evaluation are necessary to determine the cause and guide treatment.
5. Thyroid nodule: The inconclusive FNA results and the presence of a benign-appearing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and recent hospitalization for an infection. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for concern of hypertensive urgency due to new dysarthric speech. The patient presented with headache, altered mental status, and confusion, which are consistent with delirium or encephalopathy. Imaging studies, including a CT scan of the head, have ruled out any acute intra-cranial processes. Potential causes of the delirium include infection, metabolic derangement, or medication effect. Electrolyte imbalances, CBC/diff, LFTs, blood and urine cultures, and chest X-ray have been ordered to further evaluate the cause of delirium. The patient also has severe pulmonary edema, as shown on the chest X-ray, and is hypoxic, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Encephalopathy: The patient is demonstrating acute delirium, which can lead to increased risk of falls, worsening mental status, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia and subsequent intubation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure, which can progress to cardiopulmonary arrest if not adequately managed.

The patient has multiple medical complications including delirium, hypoxic respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, thyroid nodule, chronic renal insufficiency, and type 2 diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Encephalopathy: The patient is demonstrating acute delirium, and the etiology is unclear. Possible explanations include infection, metabolic derangement, or medication effect. Further evaluation with electrolyte levels, CBC/diff, LFTs, blood and urine cultures, and CXR is recommended.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation dropped early in the morning, and she was placed on BiPAP. However, she remained hypoxic, necessitating intubation. Weaning of FiO2 should be done prn, placement of an arterial line, and thoracentesis is planned.
3. Bilateral Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which may be due to heart failure exacerbation, volume overload, or a malignant effusion. Thoracentesis is planned to determine the cause, and follow-up CXRs will be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old female with hypertensive urgency, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, and delirium.
- The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on propofol. Haloperidol (Haldol) is being used as needed for delirium.
- There is a suspicion of volume overload, so diuresis is being started as tolerated.
- The patient is also being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with levofloxacin.
- Bilateral pleural effusions have been identified, and the right-sided effusion will be tapped today.
- The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, which may have contributed to congestive heart failure (CHF).
- Hypertension is being managed with an NG tube and oral medications, including labetalol.
- The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the ventilator settings need to be adjusted or if there are complications related to the endotracheal tube.

2. Delirium: The patient's delirium requires close monitoring for changes in mental status, agitation, or worsening confusion. Managing delirium can be challenging, and it increases the risk of complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presents with headache, acute on chronic renal failure, delirium/encephalopathy, hypertension, bilateral pleural effusions, and a thyroid nodule. 

The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypertensive urgency after developing dysarthric speech. She is currently intubated and sedated due to acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. An attempt to place an arterial line was unsuccessful, and it will be tried again today.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with hydralazine and a nitro patch, aiming to keep her blood pressure in the range of 160 systolic. The cause of her hypertension could be related to the subclavian stenosis or an underlying endocrine disorder such as pheochromocytoma or hyperthyroidism.

Her renal function has deteriorated further, with an increase in creatinine levels. Lasix was held due to worsening renal function, but she is still receiving other diuretics.

Delirium or encephalopathy is present, with unclear etiology. Infection, metabolic derangement, or medication effect are possible causes. The patient is currently sedated and intubated but will be treated with Geodon instead of Haldol, as per neurology recommendations.

Bilateral pleural effusions are present, and a thor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension and subclavian stenosis.
- She presents with symptoms of hypertensive urgency, new dysarthric speech, and hypoxia.
- The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently sedated.
- She has severe pulmonary edema as per the chest X-ray.
- Her creatinine levels have increased, indicating acute-on-chronic renal failure.
- The patient is also experiencing delirium or encephalopathy, with unclear etiology.
- There is evidence of embolic strokes in the posterior circulation.
- The patient's hypertension is being managed to keep systolic blood pressure in the range of 160-170 mmHg.
- Bilateral pleural effusions are present, with possible etiologies including heart failure exacerbation or malignant effusion.
- The patient has a history of a thyroid nodule, with inconclusive FNA results.
- She also has type 2 diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if she does not improve with current treatment.
2. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The increase in creatinine levels indicates declining renal function, which may require further intervention.
3. Delirium/Encephalopathy: The patient's acute delirium could progress if the underlying cause is not identified and managed appropriately.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with headaches, hypertension, and new-onset hypoxia. She was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency given new dysarthric speech. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/31-193/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and a first-degree AV block. The patient is intubated and sedated, with minimal responsiveness. She has coarse rales and decreased air at the bases of the lungs bilaterally, as well as a 2/6 systolic murmur. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has been diagnosed with hypertensive urgency, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), delirium/confusion, acute embolic strokes in the posterior circulation, acute on chronic renal failure, and thyroid enlargement.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Agree with plan to obtain CT chest to better define effusions. She may
   need therapeutic bronchoscopy today / tomorrow if secretions continue
   to be purulent. We will broaden coverage to include staph/ VAP
   associated pathogens for the short term. She is diuresing well with
   PEEP, even without lasix.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with headaches, hypertension, and new-onset hypoxia. She was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency given her dysarthric speech. The patient has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has multiple new small infarcts on MRI, likely due to a proximal embolic source. The patient also has severe pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions seen on renal US. Her thyroid mass is displacing the trachea, and she has an increased creatinine level, indicating acute-on-chronic renal failure. She is currently sedated and intubated but demonstrating acute delirium. The possible etiologies for her encephalopathy include infection, metabolic derangement, or medication effect. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite treatment with hydralazine, indicating uncontrolled hypertension.
2. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting worsening renal function. This may require further evaluation and management.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to severe pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure. Monitoring and management of her respiratory status will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and multiple medical conditions. She presented with symptoms of headache, hypertension, and new-onset hypoxia. She was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency given her new dysarthric speech. An MRI showed multiple new small infarcts, likely from a proximal embolic source. 

The patient is currently intubated and sedated. She has been treated for hypoxic respiratory failure, acute embolic strokes, acute on chronic renal failure, delirium/encephalopathy, and hypertension. She also has bilateral pleural effusions, a thyroid nodule, and type 2 diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency or emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments. It is crucial to closely monitor her blood pressure and continue efforts to lower it to prevent further end-organ damage.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has severe pulmonary edema as shown on CXR. This could be due to heart failure exacerbation or another underlying cause. Monitoring her respiratory status and providing appropriate supportive care is important.
4. Embolic strokes: The MRI findings suggest multiple embolic strokes. Continued monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and recent hypoxia.
- She presented with symptoms of hypertensive urgency and was transferred to the MICU.
- The patient has been experiencing delirium, confusion, acute respiratory failure, and acute embolic strokes in the posterior circulation.
- She has severe pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
- The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, with elevated creatinine levels.
- Other findings include a thyroid nodule, type 2 diabetes, and an inconclusive fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid nodule.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment, which can lead to organ damage if not managed properly.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Acute Embolic Strokes: The presence of multiple embolic strokes increases the risk of further neurological complications such as hemiplegia or cognitive impairment.
4. Severe Pulmonary Edema: The patient's severe pulmonary edema could worsen and lead to respiratory arrest or cardiac failure.
5. Bilateral Pleural Effusions: These effusions may cause respiratory compromise and need to be addressed promptly.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with headache, hypertension, and new-onset hypoxia. She was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency due to new dysarthric speech and multiple embolic strokes.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated and requires management.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on July 25th for hypoxic respiratory failure.
3. Acute embolic strokes in the posterior circulation: The patient has developed two days ago, and an MRI has been ordered.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, possibly due to Lasix drip, which has been stopped.
5. Delirium/Encephalopathy: The patient is demonstrating acute delirium, and the cause is unclear. Sedation and medication adjustments are being made.
6. Thyroid enlargement: The patient has a history of thyroid enlargement with inconclusive FNA results and benign nodules.
7. Type 2 diabetes: The patient has diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may progress if not properly managed.
2. Stroke progression: The patient has already experienced multiple embolic strokes,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and new-onset hypoxia. She was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency and found to have multiple embolic strokes. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated on 7/25. The etiology of respiratory failure is most likely volume overload, but pneumonia cannot be ruled out. She has been treated with levaquin and vancomycin for suspected pneumonia. The patient has acute embolic strokes in the posterior circulation, as newly aware 2 days ago, and her cardiac ultrasound showed no ASD or left ventricular thrombus. Her left ventricular systolic function is preserved. She also has acute on chronic renal failure, with creatinine remaining elevated above baseline. The patient is experiencing delirium or encephalopathy, and her thyroid enlargement was investigated in 5/22, with recommendations made then. She has type 2 diabetes and is currently on nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency and potential hypertensive emergency due to uncontrolled blood pressure.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure due to volume overload and possible pneumonia.
3. Acute embolic strokes in the posterior circulation leading to neurological deficits.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels.
5. Delirium or encephalopathy requiring further investigation and management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and recent hypoxia. She was admitted to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency due to new dysarthric speech and multiple embolic strokes. The patient has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely caused by volume overload. She also has acute on chronic renal failure, with an elevated creatinine level but no evidence of hydronephrosis on renal US. The patient is currently experiencing delirium, possibly due to hypertensive urgency and/or strokes, and is being treated with sedation and Geodon as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains high, ranging from 170s to 180s, despite being on metoprolol and amlodipine. This puts her at risk for further cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or intracranial hemorrhage.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. Regular chest X-rays and sputum cultures should be done to monitor for any signs of infection.

3. Acute Embolic Strokes: The patient has had multiple embolic strokes, as evidenced by new onset dysarthric speech and MRI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with headache, hypertension, and new hypoxia. She was found to have multiple embolic strokes and was transferred to the ICU for concern of hypertensive urgency. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to volume overload. There is a possibility of pneumonia, and she is being treated with antibiotics.

The patient also has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, but not actively rising. The cause of renal failure is unclear, and further evaluation is needed. The patient is being held on certain medications due to a suspected drug rash. She is also experiencing delirium or confusion, which could be due to infection, metabolic derangement, or medication effect.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, and her blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The underlying cause could be volume overload or pneumonia.
3. Pneumonia: There is suspicion of pneumonia, and the patient is being treated with antibiotics. Monitoring for improvement in respiratory status and culture results is important.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has had a large volume thoracentesis without difficulty and has
   also had improving UO. Creatine slightly up and new rash noted ( ?
   quinolone). She has a small infiltrate at right base ( ? re-expansion
   edema) but no drastic change in secretion output. We will transition to
   CPAP/ PSV today and hope that mental status will improve over next 24
   hours to attempt extubation if secretions do not preclude. We will also
   switch to aztreonam for coverage of VAP and avoid quinolones on account
   of rash. Urine eos pending.
   Patient is ill

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with headache, altered mental status, and new-onset hypoxia. She was found to have multiple embolic strokes and was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency. She has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has a right-sided pleural effusion.

The patient's current condition includes hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), delirium/confusion, and possible acute on chronic renal failure. Her vital signs show borderline temperatures, elevated blood pressure, stable heart rate, decreased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The pleural fluid analysis shows an elevated white blood cell count, elevated protein, and normal glucose levels.

The patient's medical history includes type 2 diabetes, thyroid enlargement, and resistant hypertension. She has been on several medications including metoprolol, amlodipine, hydralazine, famotidine, levoquin, and lasix. However, hydralazine and levoquin were temporarily discontinued due to a suspected drug rash.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypertension management with target systolic blood pressures of 140-160s, acute respiratory failure management with intubation, delirium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with headache, acute hypoxia, and confusion. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and developed multiple embolic strokes. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including hypertension, acute on chronic renal failure, delirium/encephalopathy, and a possible drug rash. She also has a history of type 2 diabetes and thyroid enlargement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, and her blood pressure is currently being managed with medications like metoprolol and amlodipine. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypertensive urgency or emergency.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has developed new infiltrates in the right base. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of these infiltrates, which could be due to fluid overload, pneumonia, or other causes.

3. Multiple Embolic Strokes: The patient has had multiple embolic strokes, which can lead to neurological deficits and increased risk of complications such as pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and signs of renal failure. Close monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the MICU for hypertensive urgency and found to have multiple embolic strokes. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a persistent erythematous maculopapular rash on her lower extremities, which may be drug-related. There are new infiltrates on chest X-ray and a recent episode of hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels. She also has acute on chronic renal failure, and urine eosinophilia was noted. The patient's mental status is difficult to assess while intubated, but she was agitated and confused prior to intubation. There are multiple other medical issues and concerns noted in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient had an episode of hypoxic respiratory failure, for which she was intubated. The cause of the respiratory failure could be due to volume overload or pneumonia.
2. Acute embolic strokes: The patient developed acute embolic strokes, resulting in dysarthric speech and potentially leading to further neurological deficits.
3. Drug rash: The patient has an erythematous maculopapular rash, which may be related to a drug reaction. Several medications have been held as a precautionary measure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and multiple embolic strokes. She presented with new-onset dysarthric speech and was transferred to the MICU for hypertensive urgency. She has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a persistent erythematous maculopapular rash on her bilateral lower quadrants, and her vital signs are stable. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels indicating acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient is also experiencing delirium/confusion and has a history of thyroid enlargement with inconclusive FNA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency/emergent: The patient's high blood pressure readings and symptoms of hypertensive urgency suggest the need for close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, and there is an ongoing effort to determine the etiology of her respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury: The elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction, which could be prerenal, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), or both. Monitoring urine output, electrolyte levels, and following up with renal US and labs are essential for managing this condition.
4. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status is difficult to assess while intub"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and multiple medical conditions.
- She presented with symptoms of hypertensive urgency and was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency.
- The patient has developed multiple embolic strokes and is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- She has a new infiltrate in the right base of the lungs and is being treated with antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
- The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and is showing signs of eosinophilia.
- She has a drug rash and is being held on several medications that may be responsible for the rash.
- The patient has delirium/confusion and agitation when sedation is weaned.
- She has a history of thyroid enlargement with inconclusive FNA results and type 2 diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently supported by mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not addressed.
2. Pneumonia: The new infiltrate in the right base of the lungs indicates a possible infection. If not properly treated, it may progress and lead to worsening respiratory symptoms.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. If left untreated, it can lead to further renal deterioration and complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with symptoms of hypertensive urgency and was transferred to the MICU. She has been diagnosed with multiple embolic strokes and is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has undergone thoracentesis and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her renal function is improving, and she is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient's delirium and encephalopathy are being closely monitored. Other medical conditions such as thyroid mass and acute on chronic renal failure are also present but on hold until the critical illness is resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support through mechanical ventilation will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Delirium/Encephalopathy: Given the patient's age and multiple embolic strokes, there is a significant risk of ongoing neurological dysfunction, including delirium and encephalopathy. Frequent neurological assessments and monitoring are essential to track any changes in mental status.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and appropriate management of fluid balance and electrolytes are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
4. Hypertension: Despite antihypertensive therapy, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. Strict blood pressure control"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and multiple embolic strokes. She was admitted to the MICU for hypertensive urgency due to new dysarthric speech and multiple embolic strokes. The patient had been intubated on 7/25 for hypoxic respiratory failure and later extubated yesterday without any shortness of breath. A new infiltrate in the right base was observed, which appears to be consistent with fluid overload rather than pneumonia. Antibiotics were stopped as a result.

The patient also has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, but they are not actively rising. Urine eosinophilia was positive, and a renal US showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. The patient's urine output is being monitored, and daily electrolytes are being followed. Medications associated with acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and drug rash are being held.

The patient is delirious and agitated but has shown improvement. She has type 2 diabetes and a history of thyroid enlargement. Further workup for the thyroid mass is needed when the patient is more stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications such as stroke or heart failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU for hypertensive urgency due to new dysarthric speech and multiple embolic strokes.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, but the specific location or cause is not mentioned in the progress note.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, and her blood pressure needs to be controlled between 140-160 mmHg. She is currently on labetalol drip and a clonidine patch, with previous medications including metoprolol, IV enalapril, and clonidine patch.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on 7/25 for hypoxic respiratory failure. The initial etiology was suspected volume overload, but it could not be ruled out as pneumonia (pna). The patient now has a new infiltrate in the right base, which appears more consistent with fluid overload rather than an infection. She is extubated yesterday and will be discharged from antibiotics.

4. Acute embolic strokes in posterior circulation: The patient developed acute awareness four days ago, and an MRI confirmed multiple embolic strokes in the posterior circulation. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild symmetric left ventricular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with headache, hypertension, and new hypoxia. She developed a question of hypertensive urgency and was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency given new dysarthric speech, found to have multiple embolic strokes. She was intubated on 7/25 for hypoxic respiratory failure due to volume overload, and now shows a new infiltrate in the right base, which appears more consistent with fluid rather than an infection. The patient's blood pressure has been poorly controlled despite multiple medications, and she has been started on a labetalol drip with a goal of 140-160s. She has also been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure, delirium/encephalopathy, possible drug rash, and a lipemic blood specimen. Further tests and treatments are planned to address these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as she was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and now has a new infiltrate in the right base. This could indicate a possible pneumonia or fluid overload. Close monitoring of her respiratory function and appropriate antibiotic therapy if an infection is suspected will be important.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite multiple medications. It is crucial to maintain tight control of her blood pressure to prevent further end-organ"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with shortness of breath, new-onset dysarthric speech, and multiple embolic strokes. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and later extubated. The patient developed a non-infectious infiltrate in the right base of the lungs, which is likely due to fluid overload. She also has acute-on-chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, but it is not actively rising. The patient has been diagnosed with acute embolic strokes in the posterior circulation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. She has been placed on labetalol drip to control her blood pressure, which has been running mostly within the target range of 140-160s. The patient's delirium and agitation have improved, and she is now more alert. She also has a history of type 2 diabetes and thyroid enlargement, but further workup is needed for the latter. The patient is currently on tube feeds through a renal formula, and a nutrition consult has been requested. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. While she was extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if her condition worsens or if she develops another lung infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, and her elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. AKI can worsen her overall condition and may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypertensive Emergency/Stroke: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which can result in hypertensive emergency or further strokes if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The presence of a lung infiltrate raises concerns about a possible infection, such as pneumonia. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
5. Delirium/Encephalopathy: The patient initially presented with agitation and delirium, which can be a sign of encephalopathy. While her alertness has improved, it is essential to continue monitoring her mental status for any signs of deterioration.
6. Drug Rash: The patient has a history of drug rashes, so there is a risk of developing another rash in response to medications. Monitoring for any skin changes is crucial.
7. Thyroid Enlargement: Although the recent fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid mass was inconclusive, the large thyroid mass seen on imaging needs further evaluation. Thyroid enlargement can sometimes be associated with thyroid dysfunction or malignancy.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, indicating potential malnutrition. Proper nutrition support is vital for her recovery."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, and multiple comorbidities. She presented with shortness of breath, confusion, and was found to have multiple embolic strokes. The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and developed an infiltrate in the right base, which was initially thought to be pneumonia but now appears to be fluid-related.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to immobility or pressure ulcers.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension and is currently being treated with multiple antihypertensive medications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The cause of respiratory failure is likely volume overload, but other etiologies have not been ruled out.
4. Delirium/confusion: The patient was agitated and delirious upon admission to the ICU but has since improved.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels remain elevated above baseline, suggesting acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease.
6. Drug rash: The patient had a suspected drug rash, possibly secondary to lasix, but has since improved.
7. Thyroid enlargement: The patient has a large thyroid mass seen on imaging, with inconclusive fine-needle aspiration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, right subclavian stenosis, who presented with headache, hypertension, and new-onset hypoxia. She was transferred to the MICU for concern of hypertensive urgency and was found to have multiple embolic strokes. The patient's current medications include a clonidine patch, metoprolol, and enalapril. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains hypertensive. The patient's recent laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. She has also shown signs of delirium and rash, which are improving. The patient's respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device and supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 at 98%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on clonidine patch and labetalol drip. This could lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
2. Acute Embolic Strokes: The patient has had multiple embolic strokes, which can cause permanent neurological damage and impair her ability to communicate and perform daily activities.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible chronic renal failure. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infection.
4. Delirium: Although the patient's delirium"
