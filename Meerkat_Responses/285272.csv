   Assessment and Plan
 62 yo Spanish male with PMH of embolic and hemorrhagic CVA, HTN, DM2
   who presents with altered mental status, fevers and hypotension and
   question of hypoxia.
   # Fevers: Likely aspiration PNA causing initial fevers, hypotension,
   leukocytosis and imaging findings in the context of a history of
   chronic aspiration and most of infiltrates in the dependent lung areas
   (vs hospital/health care associated pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization). Imaging suggests a multifocal pneumonia.  Patient was
   unexpectedly extubated last night, but has done well post-extubation
   maintaining O2 sats and appears comfortable on high flow mask.
   Speciation from sputum is still pending.  Urine Legionella antigen is
   negative.
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin & cefepime.
   -f/u sputum culture results
   -hold on fluoroquinolone or azithro for now given prolonged QTc, but
   may need to add for atypical coverage.  Reassuring that fevers have
   subsided and WBC count is trending downward.
   -stool culture given recent history of C diff
   -follow up blood cultures.
   -send nasal aspirate for influenza and viral culture
   -droplet precautions
   -aspiration precautions
   .
    # hypotension: likely secondary to infection given initially elevated
   lactate. Has not required pressor support since shortly after arriving
   on the floor.  ECHO within normal limits.  2 sets of cardiac enzymes
   negative, low suspicion for MI.
   .
   # bradycardia: was reportedly in the 50s through most of the ED stay.
   Minimal old notes in our system but his heart rate was 50-80s per those
   records.  Initial bradycardia could be secondary to neosynepherine or
   sepsis causing sick sinus vs concern for bacteremia and endocarditis vs
   just sinus bradycardia. QTc is also mildly prolonged.  Bradycardia is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia: unclear if he was hypoxic in the [**Name (NI) **] although was at least
   hypoxic at the nursing home. Likely from pneumonia. ABG looks good with
   good oxygenation.  Continue high flow mask and wean as tolerated.
   .
   # altered mental status:  Reportedly was not responding to his
   surroundings at nursing home.  At baseline unable to speak, but does
   communicate through head nods & facial responses.  Lack of response on
   presentation likely related to infection.  Head CT showed no acute
   process.  Patient has been alert and responding appropriately since he
   was extubated.
   .
   # CHF:  unknown EF or cardiac function. Has lower extremity edema and
   also has LAD, RBBB with LAFB on EKG. Also takes lasix as outpatient.
   Likely has some sort of CHF. Lungs did not sound fluid overloaded on
   presentation, but did sound so on the morning of [**10-30**].  Lasix was
   initially held given hypotension, but restarted on [**10-30**].  No evidence
   of CHF on EHCO.
   -not on BB for unclear reason but would hold now anyway.
   -hold ACEI given initial hypotension and ARF
   .
   # CAD with history of MI: No evidence for cardiac ischemia.  EKG
   changes may have been secondary to pulmonary process.
   -continue plavix, statin, unclear why not on BB but currently
   bradycardic so hold off.
   -not on aspirin likely given already on coumadin and plavix with
   history of CVA (hemorrhagic and embolic)
   .
   # acute renal failure: Cr 1.1 on admission, likely pre-renal as it has
   now resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   -monitor UOP
   -if worsens, will check urine lytes
   -hold ACEI
   # diabetes type 2: Unknown control. Finger sticks, continue insulin
   regular scale for now.  Will need tube feeds with carbohydrate control.
   # sacral decubs: stage I and also an old healing ulcer without
   currently skin breakdown or signs of infection
   -wound care consult
   # anemia: chronic iron deficiency anemia. HCT at baseline currently.
   Monitor closely. Is scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy at the end of
   this month.
   # elevated transaminases: likely related to hypotension. Continue to
   monitor and will investigate further pending the trend.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # chronic pain: Sedating medications restarted post-extubation, but POs
   held given concern for regurgitation/aspiration of GI contents on
   evening of [**10-29**].   Given IV morphine Q6 instead of PO Q8 for pain.
   (currently not receiving baclofen, PO morphine, neurontin)
   # h/o embolic and hemorrhagic CVA: continue plavix, hold coumadin given
   supratherapeutic INR. Will start heparin gtt when INR at 2 or if
   improved, can even restart coumadin if not procedures anticipated.
   # h/o DVT: currently anticoagulated.
   # depression: continue cymbalta, mirtazepine
   # FEN: Was started on reglan 10 mg Q6H for NPO for now and start tube
   feeds with nutrition consult. Has J tube. IVF for hydration. Replete
   lytes prn.
   # PPX: VAP bundle, anticoagulated currently for DVT ppx, H2 blocker for
   GI ppx. Wound care.
   # Communication: Wife: [**Name (NI) 2009**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2010**]. Son [**Name (NI) 2011**] [**Location (un) 2012**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic iron deficiency anemia. He presents with altered mental status, fevers, hypotension, and question of hypoxia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia with multifocal infiltrates on chest imaging. He was unexpectedly extubated last night and has done well post-extubation, maintaining oxygen saturation and appearing comfortable on high flow mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation with fevers, leukocytosis, and imaging findings suggests pneumonia. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime. Follow-up sputum culture results are pending.
2. Aspiration: Given the patient's history of chronic aspiration, there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia. Droplet precautions should be continued to prevent transmission.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to infection, as indicated by elevated lactate levels. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation should be maintained.
4. Bradycardia: The patient initially had a bradycardia heart rate in the 50s. This could be due to neosynepherine or sepsis causing sick sinus syndrome. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be related to pneumonia. ABG results show good oxygenation, so continuing high flow mask and weaning as tolerated is appropriate.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to infection. Head CT showed no acute process, and the patient has been alert and responsive since extubation.
7. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has lower extremity edema and LAD, RBBB with LAFB on EKG. CHF cannot be ruled out, and Lasix should be continued.
8. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient had an initial creatinine level of 1.1, which likely represented pre-renal azotemia. Fluid resuscitation has resolved the issue, but monitoring UOP and holding ACE inhibitors is recommended.
9. Diabetes Type 2: Unknown control. Finger sticks should be continued, and insulin regular scale should be administered. Tube feeds with carbohydrate control will be needed.
10. Sacral Decubitus: Stage I sacral decubitus is present. Wound care consult should be obtained.
11. Anemia: Chronic iron deficiency anemia is present. Monitoring HCT and scheduling an outpatient colonoscopy are recommended.
12. Elevated Transaminases: Likely related to hypotension. Close monitoring and further investigation are needed.
13. Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
14. Chronic Pain: Sedating medications should be restarted post-extubation, but POs should be held due to concern for regurgitation/aspiration of GI contents.
15. History of Embolic and Hemorrhagic CVA: Continue Plavix, hold Coumadin given supratherapeutic INR. Start heparin gtt when INR at"

   Assessment and Plan
 62 yo Spanish male with PMH of embolic and hemorrhagic CVA, HTN, DM2
   who presents with altered mental status, fevers and hypotension and
   question of hypoxia.
   # Fevers: Likely aspiration PNA causing initial fevers, hypotension,
   leukocytosis and imaging findings in the context of a history of
   chronic aspiration and most of infiltrates in the dependent lung areas
   (vs hospital/health care associated pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization). Imaging suggests a multifocal pneumonia.  Patient was
   unexpectedly extubated last night, but has done well post-extubation
   maintaining O2 sats and appears comfortable on high flow mask.
   Speciation from sputum is still pending.  Urine Legionella antigen is
   negative.
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin & cefepime.
   -f/u sputum culture results
   -hold on fluoroquinolone or azithro for now given prolonged QTc, but
   may need to add for atypical coverage.  Reassuring that fevers have
   subsided and WBC count is trending downward.
   -stool culture given recent history of C diff
   -follow up blood cultures.
   -send nasal aspirate for influenza and viral culture
   -droplet precautions
   -aspiration precautions
   .
    # hypotension: likely secondary to infection given initially elevated
   lactate. Has not required pressor support since shortly after arriving
   on the floor.  ECHO within normal limits.  2 sets of cardiac enzymes
   negative, low suspicion for MI.
   .
   # bradycardia: was reportedly in the 50s through most of the ED stay.
   Minimal old notes in our system but his heart rate was 50-80s per those
   records.  Initial bradycardia could be secondary to neosynepherine or
   sepsis causing sick sinus vs concern for bacteremia and endocarditis vs
   just sinus bradycardia. QTc is also mildly prolonged.  Bradycardia is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia: unclear if he was hypoxic in the [**Name (NI) **] although was at least
   hypoxic at the nursing home. Likely from pneumonia. ABG looks good with
   good oxygenation.  Continue high flow mask and wean as tolerated.
   .
   # altered mental status:  Reportedly was not responding to his
   surroundings at nursing home.  At baseline unable to speak, but does
   communicate through head nods & facial responses.  Lack of response on
   presentation likely related to infection.  Head CT showed no acute
   process.  Patient has been alert and responding appropriately since he
   was extubated.
   .
   # CHF:  unknown EF or cardiac function. Has lower extremity edema and
   also has LAD, RBBB with LAFB on EKG. Also takes lasix as outpatient.
   Likely has some sort of CHF. Lungs did not sound fluid overloaded on
   presentation, but did sound so on the morning of [**10-30**].  Lasix was
   initially held given hypotension, but restarted on [**10-30**].  No evidence
   of CHF on EHCO.
   -not on BB for unclear reason but would hold now anyway.
   -hold ACEI given initial hypotension and ARF
   .
   # CAD with history of MI: No evidence for cardiac ischemia.  EKG
   changes may have been secondary to pulmonary process.
   -continue plavix, statin, unclear why not on BB but currently
   bradycardic so hold off.
   -not on aspirin likely given already on coumadin and plavix with
   history of CVA (hemorrhagic and embolic)
   .
   # acute renal failure: Cr 1.1 on admission, likely pre-renal as it has
   now resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   -monitor UOP
   -if worsens, will check urine lytes
   -hold ACEI
   # diabetes type 2: Unknown control. Finger sticks, continue insulin
   regular scale for now.  Will need tube feeds with carbohydrate control.
   # sacral decubs: stage I and also an old healing ulcer without
   currently skin breakdown or signs of infection
   -wound care consult
   # anemia: chronic iron deficiency anemia. HCT at baseline currently.
   Monitor closely. Is scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy at the end of
   this month.
   # elevated transaminases: likely related to hypotension. Continue to
   monitor and will investigate further pending the trend.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # chronic pain: Sedating medications restarted post-extubation, but POs
   held given concern for regurgitation/aspiration of GI contents on
   evening of [**10-29**].   Given IV morphine Q6 instead of PO Q8 for pain.
   (currently not receiving baclofen, PO morphine, neurontin)
   # h/o embolic and hemorrhagic CVA: continue plavix, hold coumadin given
   supratherapeutic INR. Will start heparin gtt when INR at 2 or if
   improved, can even restart coumadin if not procedures anticipated.
   # h/o DVT: currently anticoagulated.
   # depression: continue cymbalta, mirtazepine
   # FEN: Was started on reglan 10 mg Q6H for retaining food in stomach &
   regurgitating to oropharynx on evening of [**10-29**].  No meds or fluids
   given per PEG overnight.  Will slowly restart meds today & determine
   how pt. tolerates them before advancing to PEG tube feeds.  Pt. must be
   NPO due to risk of aspiration.  Nutrition consult requested.  Repleting
   lytes prn.
   # PPX: anticoagulated currently for DVT ppx, H2 blocker for GI ppx.
   Bowel regimen increased.  Wound care.

The patient is a 62-year-old Spanish male with a medical history of embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic iron deficiency anemia, hypothyroidism, chronic pain, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and depression. He presented with altered mental status, fevers, hypotension, and question of hypoxia. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has had multiple interventions and complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic aspiration and recent episodes of regurgitation and aspiration, which may lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Multifocal pneumonia: Imaging suggests a multifocal pneumonia, possibly due to hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever, hypotension, and elevated lactate suggests sepsis, likely secondary to infection.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient had an initial increase in creatinine from 1.1 to 2.7, which resolved with fluid resuscitation, indicating possible pre-renal acute kidney injury.
5. Bradycardia: The patient had bradycardia initially, which resolved spontaneously. It could be secondary to neosynepherine or sepsis causing sick sinus syndrome.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic iron deficiency anemia. He presents with altered mental status, fevers, hypotension, and question of hypoxia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The assessment suggests that the patient likely has an infection causing the fevers and hypotension, with possible aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient also has a history of chronic pain, depression, and is anticoagulated for a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to sepsis secondary to infection. It is important to continue with pressor support and closely monitor the patient's response to treatment.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is currently good on the vent, but there is a concern for hypoxia due to pneumonia. Continuing with vent support and adjusting FiO2 as needed is essential.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be related to infection. It is crucial to limit medications that can alter mental status and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 50s, which may be related to sepsis or the use of neosynephrine. Weaning off neo and monitoring the EKG for any changes is important.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible acute renal failure. Monitoring urine output and checking urine electrolytes is necessary.
6. Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, and holding sedation medications should be considered.
7. Sacral decubitus: The patient has a stage I sacral decubitus ulcer, and a wound care consult should be obtained.
8. Anemia: The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia, and monitoring closely with planned outpatient colonoscopy is necessary.
9. Elevated transaminases: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be related to hypotension. Monitoring and investigating further pending the trend is important.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and continuing levothyroxine is necessary.
11. History of embolic and hemorrhagic CVA: The patient's history of embolic and hemorrhagic CVA should be considered when making decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
12. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and continuing antidepressant medications is important.
13. Nutritional support: The patient requires nutritional support, and a nutrition consult for tube feeds is necessary.
14. Prophylaxis: The patient requires prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Imaging shows basilar opacities without dense consolidation. The patient has been extubated without event and continues to experience persistent hypoxemia. The plan includes continuing with antibiotics (Vancomycin/Cefepime), aspiration precautions, Reglan IV q 6 hours, weaning O2 as possible, and following up on culture results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure indicates compromised lung function, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's impaired physical mobility may increase the risk of bedsores, muscle weakness, and decreased overall functional status.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can lead to the development of pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
4. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's current condition suggests the presence of an infection, which can progress to sepsis and potentially cause organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate assessment and appropriate management of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
 62 yo Spanish male with PMH of embolic and hemorrhagic CVA, HTN, DM2
   who presents with altered mental status, fevers and hypotension and
   question of hypoxia.
   # Fevers: Likely aspiration PNA causing initial fevers, hypotension,
   leukocytosis and imaging findings in the context of a history of
   chronic aspiration and most of infiltrates in the dependent lung areas
   (vs hospital/health care associated pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization). Imaging suggests a multifocal pneumonia.  Patient was
   unexpectedly extubated last night, but has done well post-extubation
   maintaining O2 sats and appears comfortable on high flow mask.
   Speciation from sputum is still pending.  Urine Legionella antigen is
   negative.
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin & cefepime.
   -f/u sputum culture results
   -hold on fluoroquinolone or azithro for now given prolonged QTc, but
   may need to add for atypical coverage.  Reassuring that fevers have
   subsided and WBC count is trending downward.
   -stool culture given recent history of C diff
   -follow up blood cultures.
   -send nasal aspirate for influenza and viral culture
   -droplet precautions
   -aspiration precautions
   .
    # hypotension: likely secondary to infection given initially elevated
   lactate. Has not required pressor support since shortly after arriving
   on the floor.  ECHO within normal limits.  2 sets of cardiac enzymes
   negative, low suspicion for MI.
   .
   # bradycardia: was reportedly in the 50s through most of the ED stay.
   Minimal old notes in our system but his heart rate was 50-80s per those
   records.  Initial bradycardia could be secondary to neosynepherine or
   sepsis causing sick sinus vs concern for bacteremia and endocarditis vs
   just sinus bradycardia. QTc is also mildly prolonged.  Bradycardia is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia: unclear if he was hypoxic in the [**Name (NI) **] although was at least
   hypoxic at the nursing home. Likely from pneumonia. ABG looks good with
   good oxygenation.  Continue high flow mask and wean as tolerated.
   .
   # altered mental status:  Reportedly was not responding to his
   surroundings at nursing home.  At baseline unable to speak, but does
   communicate through head nods & facial responses.  Lack of response on
   presentation likely related to infection.  Head CT showed no acute
   process.  Patient has been alert and responding appropriately since he
   was extubated.
   .
   # CHF:  unknown EF or cardiac function. Has lower extremity edema and
   also has LAD, RBBB with LAFB on EKG. Also takes lasix as outpatient.
   Likely has some sort of CHF. Lungs did not sound fluid overloaded on
   presentation, but did sound so on the morning of [**10-30**].  Lasix was
   initially held given hypotension, but restarted on [**10-30**].  No evidence
   of CHF on EHCO.
   -not on BB for unclear reason but would hold now anyway.
   -hold ACEI given initial hypotension and ARF
   .
   # CAD with history of MI: No evidence for cardiac ischemia.  EKG
   changes may have been secondary to pulmonary process.
   -continue plavix, statin, unclear why not on BB but currently
   bradycardic so hold off.
   -not on aspirin likely given already on coumadin and plavix with
   history of CVA (hemorrhagic and embolic)
   .
   # acute renal failure: Cr 1.1 on admission, likely pre-renal as it has
   now resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   -monitor UOP
   -if worsens, will check urine lytes
   -hold ACEI
   # diabetes type 2: Unknown control. Finger sticks, continue insulin
   regular scale for now.  Will need tube feeds with carbohydrate control.
   # sacral decubs: stage I and also an old healing ulcer without
   currently skin breakdown or signs of infection
   -wound care consult
   # anemia: chronic iron deficiency anemia. HCT at baseline currently.
   Monitor closely. Is scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy at the end of
   this month.
   # elevated transaminases: likely related to hypotension. Continue to
   monitor and will investigate further pending the trend.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # chronic pain: Sedating medications restarted post-extubation, but POs
   held given concern for regurgitation/aspiration of GI contents on
   evening of [**10-29**].   Given IV morphine Q6 instead of PO Q8 for pain.
   (currently not receiving baclofen, PO morphine, neurontin)
   # h/o embolic and hemorrhagic CVA: continue plavix, hold coumadin given
   supratherapeutic INR. Will start heparin gtt when INR at 2 or if
   improved, can even restart coumadin if not procedures anticipated.
   # h/o DVT: currently anticoagulated.
   # depression: continue cymbalta, mirtazepine
   # FEN: Was started on reglan 10 mg Q6H for retaining food in stomach &
   regurgitating to oropharynx on evening of [**10-29**].  No meds or fluids
   given per PEG overnight.  Will slowly restart meds today & determine
   how pt. tolerates them before advancing to PEG tube feeds.  Pt. must be
   NPO due to risk of aspiration.  Nutrition consult requested.  Repleting
   lytes prn.
   # PPX: anticoagulated currently for DVT ppx, H2 blocker for GI ppx.
   Bowel regimen increased.  Wound care.
   # Communication: Wife: [**Name (NI) 2009**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2010**]. Son [**Name (NI) 2011**] [**Location (un) 2012**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old Spanish male with a medical history of embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic iron deficiency anemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic pain. He presents with altered mental status, fevers, hypotension, and possible hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Fevers: The patient initially had fevers, which are likely due to aspiration pneumonia. Imaging suggests multifocal pneumonia, possibly healthcare-associated pneumonia given recent hospitalization.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to infection, as indicated by elevated lactate levels. The patient has not required pressor support since shortly after arriving on the floor. An echocardiogram (ECHO) shows normal limits, and cardiac enzymes are negative, with low suspicion for myocardial infarction (MI).

3. Bradycardia: The patient had a heart rate in the 50s through most of the emergency department stay. Minimal old notes in our system show his heart rate was in the 50-80s. Initial bradycardia could be secondary to neosynepherine or sepsis causing sick sinus syndrome, or concern for bacteremia and endocarditis. The bradycardia has now resolved.

4. Hypoxia: The patient was hypoxic at the nursing home and likely"

   Respiratory virus uninterpretable; urinary legionella negative; Sputum
   4+ GPCs, sputum cx sparse oropharyngeal growth
   Assessment and Plan
 62 yo Spanish male with PMH of embolic and hemorrhagic CVA, HTN, DM2
   who presents with altered mental status, fevers and hypotension and
   question of hypoxia.
   # Fevers: Likely aspiration PNA causing initial fevers, hypotension,
   leukocytosis and imaging findings in the context of a history of
   chronic aspiration and most of infiltrates in the dependent lung areas
   (vs hospital/health care associated pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization). Imaging suggests a multifocal pneumonia.  Patient was
   unexpectedly extubated on evening of [**10-29**], but has done well
   post-extubation maintaining O2 sats and appears comfortable on 5L NC.
   Sputum cx without identifiable organisms.  Urine Legionella antigen is
   negative.
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin & cefepime for
   aspiration PNA
   -stool culture given recent history of C diff
   -follow up blood cultures.
   -resend nasal aspirate for influenza and viral culture
   -droplet precautions
   -aspiration precautions
   .
    # hypotension: likely secondary to infection given initially elevated
   lactate. Has not required pressor support since shortly after arriving
   on the floor.  ECHO within normal limits.  2 sets of cardiac enzymes
   negative, low suspicion for MI.
   .
   # bradycardia: Now resolved.  Was reportedly in the 50s through most of
   the ED stay. Minimal old notes in our system but his heart rate was
   50-80s per those records.  Initial bradycardia could be secondary to
   neosynepherine or sepsis causing sick sinus vs concern for bacteremia
   and endocarditis vs just sinus bradycardia. QTc is also mildly
   prolonged.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Resolved.  Unclear if he was hypoxic in the ED although was
   at least hypoxic at the nursing home. Likely from pneumonia. ABG looks
   good with good oxygenation.  Continue high flow mask and wean as
   tolerated.
   .
   # altered mental status:  Resolved.  Reportedly was not responding to
   his surroundings at nursing home.  At baseline unable to speak, but
   does communicate through head nods & facial responses.  Lack of
   response on presentation likely related to infection.  Head CT showed
   no acute process.  Patient has been alert and responding appropriately
   since he was extubated.
   .
   # CHF:  unknown EF or cardiac function. Has lower extremity edema and
   also has LAD, RBBB with LAFB on EKG. Also takes lasix as outpatient.
   Likely has some sort of CHF. Lungs did not sound fluid overloaded on
   presentation, but did sound so on the morning of [**10-30**].  Lasix was
   initially held given hypotension, but restarted on [**10-30**].  No evidence
   of CHF on EHCO.
   -not on BB for unclear reason but would hold now anyway.
   -hold ACEI given initial hypotension and ARF
   .
   # CAD with history of MI: No evidence for cardiac ischemia.  EKG
   changes may have been secondary to pulmonary process.
   -continue plavix, statin, unclear why not on BB but currently
   bradycardic so hold off.
   -not on aspirin likely given already on coumadin and plavix with
   history of CVA (hemorrhagic and embolic)
   .
   # acute renal failure: Cr 1.1 on admission, likely pre-renal as it has
   now resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   -monitor UOP
   -if worsens, will check urine lytes
   -hold ACEI
   # diabetes type 2: Unknown control. Finger sticks, continue insulin
   regular scale for now.  Will need tube feeds with carbohydrate control.
   # sacral decubs: stage I and also an old healing ulcer without
   currently skin breakdown or signs of infection
   -wound care consult
   # anemia: chronic iron deficiency anemia. HCT at baseline currently.
   Monitor closely. Is scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy at the end of
   this month.
   # elevated transaminases: likely related to hypotension. Continue to
   monitor and will investigate further pending the trend.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # chronic pain: Sedating medications restarted post-extubation, but POs
   held given concern for regurgitation/aspiration of GI contents on
   evening of [**10-29**].   Given IV morphine Q6 instead of PO Q8 for pain.
   Now on home doses of PO morphine, baclofen, & neurontin.
   # h/o embolic and hemorrhagic CVA: Warfarin restarted at home dose.
   # h/o DVT: currently anticoagulated.
   # depression: continue cymbalta, mirtazepine
   # FEN: Was started on reglan 10 mg Q6H for retaining food in stomach &
   regurgitating to oropharynx on evening of [**10-29**] with good effect.  Now
   tolerating meds & TF through PEG without regurgitation/aspiration.  Pt.
   must be NPO due to risk of aspiration.  Nutrition consult requested.
   Repleting lytes prn.
   # PPX: anticoagulated currently for DVT ppx, H2 blocker for GI ppx.
   Bowel regimen increased.  Wound care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic iron deficiency anemia, hypothyroidism, chronic pain, depression, and deep vein thrombosis. The patient presented with altered mental status, fevers, hypotension, and question of hypoxia. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient likely has aspiration pneumonia (PNA) causing initial fevers, hypotension, leukocytosis, and imaging findings in the context of a history of chronic aspiration. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued with vancomycin and cefepime for aspiration PNA. Other assessments include hypotension likely secondary to infection, bradycardia resolved, hypoxia resolved, altered mental status resolved, congestive heart failure (CHF) unknown ejection fraction or cardiac function, history of myocardial infarction (MI), acute renal failure (ARF) resolved, diabetes type 2 unknown control, sacral decubitus stage I, elevated transaminases likely related to hypotension, hypothyroidism, chronic pain, history of embolic and hemorrhagic CVA, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and depression.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 62-year-old male, was admitted with aspiration pneumonia. He has been managed with Reglan for motility, frequent suctioning, and chest physiotherapy. There has been a significant decrease in white blood cell count and no further episodes of observed aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as indicated by the need for frequent saturation monitoring. Continued administration of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefepime) is necessary.
2. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The use of Reglan to improve gastric motility should be continued. The patient should remain NPO (nothing by mouth) and receive tube feeds only. Supervised feeds will be required going forward.
3. LE Pain: Outpatient medications for LE pain will be continued.
4. Pneumonia, Other: The patient's pneumonia will require further management, including the completion of antibiotic therapy.
5. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's mobility will need to be addressed to prevent further complications.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: Regular skin assessments and interventions should be implemented to maintain skin integrity.
7. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent progression to septic shock or organ dysfunction.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."
