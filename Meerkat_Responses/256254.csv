   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - STOP [**2171-5-7**] 11:29 AM
   Pt. known to MICU service, since discharge to medical [**Hospital1 **] yesterday
   AM.
   Overnight continued to experience dyspnea and dry cough (according to
   daughter).  Tolerated bedside right thoracentesis without complications
   (although only able to remove <100 ml pink fluid).  Experienced
   progressive dyspnea this late PM, associated with audible wheezing,
   with poor ABG --> intubated on medical [**Hospital1 **], and now transferred back
   to MICU service.
   Upon arrival to MICU, currently intubated, mechanically ventilated.
   Appears comfortable.  Two daughters and son-in-law present in room.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese-speaking h/o CVA, dementia now with increased
   respiratory distress and respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to probable RLL
   pneumonia (aspiration), evolving effusions (right > left), and possible
   cardiac decompensation.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.  Continue empirical
   antimicrobials.  VAP precautions.  Monitor for wheezing --> albuterol
   prn.  At risk for ARDS.
   WHEEZES -- by report of daughter.  Cardiac vs. reactive airways.
   Monitor.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to pulmonary infiltrate (possible RLL
   pneumonia) and pleural effusions, +/- wheezing.  Continue supplimental
   oxygen to maintain SaO2>90%.
   PLEURAL EFFUSSIONS -- attributed to parapneumonia effusion and possible
   underlying CHF.  Await final analysis of right thoracentesis.  Monitor
   CXR.
   FLUIDS -- net volume depleted/hypovolemic clinically.  Desire net
   expansion (careful).  Monitor I/O.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- improving.  continue free H2O repletion, monitor Na.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF working to goal rate.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- currently difficult to assess neurologically
   as pt. sedated.  No obvious new clinical CVA syndrome.  Anticipate
   return to baseline as underlying illness resolves.
   ANEMIA -- monitor Hct, stool guiac.  ?ACD

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F w h/o CVA, dementia, RA who was being treated for HAP vs.
   aspiration PNA with right sided effusion who developed respiratory
   failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. Recently admitted and
   discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] ([**2171-5-7**]) for treatment of HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory distress and resulting hypercarbia: Etiology most likely
   multi-factorial from PNA, large effusion and diastolic CHF. Concern of
   aspiration due to suctioning of tube feeds following intubation.
   Patient underwent thoracentesis today which only drained 30 cc of pink
   fluid (see operative note). Evaluation suggests non-infectious process
   and most likely secondary to cardiac failure. Effusion was transudate
   by Light's criteria, WBCs < 72 and negative gram stain. CXR following
   procedure and intubation demonstrated no pneumothorax. Influenza
   negative and blood cultures no growth to date.
   - Continue treatment of PNA with Levofloxacin 750 mg IV Q48H,
   Piperacillin-Tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H and Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q48H
   - Scopolamine Patch for secretions to reduce aspiration risk, hold tube
   feeds overnight
   - Thoracentesis ruled out empyema, but drained only minimal fluid for
   therapeutic relief
   - Pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic HF order Lasix 20 mg IV with

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and recent hospitalization for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and hypercarbia. The patient underwent thoracentesis, which only drained a small amount of pink fluid, indicating a non-infectious process, likely secondary to cardiac failure. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema due to diastolic heart failure and is being treated with Lasix. The patient's blood pressure is labile and requires careful management. Her lactic acid levels are elevated, indicating possible hypoperfusion. She also has hypernatremia, anemia of chronic disease, and osteoporosis. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), but not DNI (do not intubate) for now, per family preference.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of progression or development of new infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Cardiac Failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure may worsen, leading to further pulmonary edema and fluid overload.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is"

   # Respiratory distress: Patient known HAP PNA, large effusion and
   diastolic CHF. Acute episode requiring intubation most likely related
   to aspiration. Today CXR demonstrates pulmonary edema. Patient with
   poor urine output, did not respond to lasix,  start dopamine to reach
   negative 500 goal. Patient requiring assist control, unlikely to
   tolerate pressure support.

   - Albuterol, ipratropium nebs prn.
   - f/u blood cultures, send sputum culture
   - Aspiration precautions.
   .
   # Cardiac Failure: EF demonstrates new regional wall abnormality and
   worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST elevation. Most likely
   suffered acute event during respiratory distress. No longer requiring
   pressors for blood pressure support. Lactate acid improving. Holding
   outpatient BB and CCB due to low blood pressure.

   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o CVA, dementia, RA who was being treated for HAP
   vs. aspiration PNA with right sided effusion who developed respiratory
   failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. Recently admitted and
   discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] ([**2171-5-7**]) for treatment of HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory distress and resulting hypercarbia: Etiology most likely
   multi-factorial from PNA, large effusion and diastolic CHF. Concern of
   aspiration due to suctioning of tube feeds following intubation.
   Patient underwent thoracentesis today which only drained 30 cc of pink
   fluid (see operative note). Evaluation suggests non-infectious process
   and most likely secondary to cardiac failure. Effusion was transudate
   by Light's criteria, WBCs < 72 and negative gram stain. CXR following
   procedure and intubation demonstrated no pneumothorax. Influenza
   negative and blood cultures no growth to date.
   - Continue treatment of PNA with Levofloxacin 750 mg IV Q48H,
   Piperacillin-Tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H and Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q48H
   - Scopolamine Patch for secretions to reduce aspiration risk, hold tube
   feeds overnight
   - Thoracentesis ruled out empyema, but drained only minimal fluid for
   therapeutic relief
   - Pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic HF order Lasix 20 mg IV with
   goal negative 500 cc/day.
   - Albuterol, ipratropium nebs prn.
   - f/u blood cultures, send sputum culture
   - Aspiration precautions.
   .
   # Hypotension: Only hypotensive following intubation. Most likely
   secondary to sedation and PEEP reduction of cardiac return. Patient's
   blood pressure is very labile and can range from SBP 90-140s. However,
   elevated Lactate does suggest hypoperfusion. Patient recently had ECHO
   which demonstrating normal EF, mild aortic regurgitation and elevated
   PCWP.
   - Continue Phenylephrine for MAP > 60, urine output 20 cc/hr
   - CVP 14 - hold on IVF boluses
   - Send blood cultures, urine cultures to eval sepsis
   - Broad spectrum abxs with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Most likely related to hypoperfusion, treat
   hypotension as above.
   - Monitor morning lactate
   .
   # h/o CHF - holding b-blocker, CCB due to hypotension
   - small lasix dose to treat pulm edema
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved 145 this morning. Continue to monitor daily.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and respiratory failure. She has a large right-sided effusion that was drained, but only 30 cc of pink fluid was obtained. The evaluation suggests a non-infectious process, most likely secondary to cardiac failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, hypotension, respiratory distress, hypercarbia, lactic acidosis, hypernatremia, anemia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient developed respiratory failure requiring intubation. There is concern for aspiration due to suctioning of tube feeds following intubation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. HAP: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy with Levofloxacin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and Vancomycin will be continued. Regular follow-up of blood cultures and sputum culture is needed to assess the effectiveness of treatment.
3. Right-Sided Effusion: The patient had a large right-sided effusion that was drained, but only minimal fluid was obtained. This suggests a non-infectious process, most likely secondary to cardiac failure. Further evaluation and management of the underlying cause of the effusion are required.

   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patient known HAP PNA, large effusion and
   diastolic CHF. Acute episode requiring intubation most likely related
   to aspiration. Today CXR demonstrates pulmonary edema. Patient with
   poor urine output, did not respond to lasix,  start dopamine to reach
   negative 500 goal. Patient requiring assist control, unlikely to
   tolerate pressure support.
   - Continue treatment of PNA with Levofloxacin 750 mg IV Q48H,
   Piperacillin-Tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H and Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q48H
   for total 8 days of treatment [**5-6**]
   - Scopolamine Patch for secretions to reduce aspiration risk
   - Dopamine low dose for urine output
   - Albuterol, ipratropium nebs prn.
   - f/u blood cultures, send sputum culture
   - Aspiration precautions.
   .
   # Cardiac Failure: EF demonstrates new regional wall abnormality and
   worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST elevation. Most likely
   suffered acute event during respiratory distress. No longer requiring
   pressors for blood pressure support. Lactate acid improving. Holding
   outpatient BB and CCB due to low blood pressure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the hospital due to suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia with right-sided effusion. The patient developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, leading to intubation. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, likely related to aspiration pneumonia, large effusion, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The recent chest X-ray demonstrates pulmonary edema. The patient also has poor urine output, unresponsive to Lasix, and is receiving low-dose dopamine to achieve a negative fluid balance goal.

The patient is being treated for HAP with levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin for a total of 8 days. She is also receiving a scopolamine patch to reduce secretions and aspiration risk, as well as albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers as needed. Blood cultures and sputum cultures have been ordered.

Additionally, the patient has cardiac failure with evidence of new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR), but troponin and CK levels are negative. There is no evidence of ST elevation on the EKG. The patient's blood pressure is stable without the need for pressors, and lactate levels are improving. Outpatient beta"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with a large effusion and diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress, which is most likely related to aspiration. A chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema. The patient also has poor urine output and did not respond to Lasix, so dopamine was started to reach a negative fluid balance goal.

The patient is being treated with Levofloxacin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and Vancomycin for a total of 8 days of antibiotic therapy. Scopolamine patches are being used to reduce secretions and aspiration risk. Dopamine is being given at a low dose for urine output. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers are provided as needed. Blood cultures and sputum cultures are being followed up. Aspiration precautions are in place, and the patient is being turned off sedation for a trial of spontaneous breathing.

The patient is also being evaluated for cardiac failure, hypernatremia, anemia, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), constipation, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. The patient's goals of care will be discussed with the family over the weekend.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of stroke, dementia (including Alzheimer's and multi-infarct), and fever of unknown origin. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management medications. He has been receiving dopamine to maintain blood pressure and heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F), heart rate between 60-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/35 mmHg to 139/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 14 mmHg, total fluid input of 2,489 mL and output of 940 mL since 12 AM, with a balance of 1,549 mL.

Respiratory support consists of a volume-controlled ventilation mode with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal range.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and effusions. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. They have a history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke), dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/44 to 139/64 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's CVP is 14 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 2,489 mL and output of 1,549 mL. The patient's blood products and urine output are also documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia. This condition can lead to further deterioration in lung function, increased risk of infection, and potential sepsis.

2. Effusions: The presence of effusions may indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs or elsewhere in the body. This can compromise respiratory function, increase pressure on surrounding structures, and contribute to organ dysfunction.

3. Dementia and Stroke: The patient's history of dementia and stroke increases the risk of delirium, agitation, and impaired neurological function. These conditions can complicate the patient's overall clinical picture and hinder communication and decision-making.

4. Medication Interactions: With multiple"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F w h/o CVA, dementia, RA who was being treated for HAP vs.
   aspiration PNA with right sided effusion who developed respiratory
   failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. Recently admitted and
   discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] ([**2171-5-7**]) for treatment of HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patient known HAP PNA, large effusion and
   diastolic CHF. Acute episode requiring intubation most likely related
   to aspiration. Patient with poor urine output, did not respond to lasix
   and dopamine drip support.
   - stop levo (6/15
 [**5-11**])
   - continue Piperacillin-Tazobactam 2.25 g IV Q6H and Vancomycin 1000 mg
   IV Q48H for total 8 days of treatment started [**5-6**]
   - scopolamine Patch for secretions to reduce aspiration risk
   - albuterol, ipratropium nebs prn.
   - f/u blood cultures, send sputum culture
   - aspiration precautions.
   - turn off sedation and try PS 5/5 for trial
   .
   # Cardiac Failure: EF demonstrates new regional wall abnormality and
   worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST elevation. Most likely
   suffered acute event during respiratory distress. No longer requiring
   pressors for blood pressure support. Lactate improved. Holding
   outpatient BB and CCB due to low blood pressure.
   - daily ASA
   # Anemia
 Decreased to 24 from 29. Drop most likely related to IVF and
   possible suppression for sepsis. Iron studies consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease. Stable.
   - Active type and screen
   .
   # Possible UTI: urine with yeast on [**5-9**]
   - will change Foley
   - monitor UO
   ..
   # Rheumatoid arthritis: Hold azathioprine for now given infection.
   .
   # Osteoporosis: continue outpatient calcium and vitamin D.
   .
   # Goals of care:  Discuss with family over weekend goals of care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA (stroke), dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) and is being treated with Levofloxacin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and Vancomycin.

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, hypotension, and anemia. 

Respiratory failure: The patient developed respiratory distress and required intubation due to suspected aspiration. The patient has not tolerated weaning attempts in the past and is currently on assist-control ventilation. The chest X-ray demonstrates pulmonary edema.

Impaired skin integrity: The patient has poor urine output and did not respond to lasix, prompting the initiation of dopamine to achieve negative fluid balance. 

Alteration in nutrition: The patient has been placed on Fibersource HN (Full) at 45 mL/hour.

Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 100% with the use of supplemental oxygen.

Fever of unknown origin: The patient has had a fever, but the source has not yet been identified.

Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable without the need for pressors.

Anemia: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of stroke, dementia, and pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia and effusions. The patient is currently intubated and unresponsive, with congested lungs and a heart rate of 99 beats per minute. His blood pressure is 113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, pain management medication, and prophylactic heparin. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Liver function tests are within normal range, but kidney function is slightly impaired with elevated creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are mostly within normal range, except for one reading of 131 mg/dL. The patient's medical history includes CVA (stroke), dementia, and pneumonia. His goals of care are being refocused towards comfort due to the severity of his condition. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned as tolerated. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance, and the patient's nutrition is being provided through a feeding tube. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of stroke, dementia, and pneumonia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,525 mL and output of 572 mL since midnight.

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 375 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 127, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 245. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 98%, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 21 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -1.

Physical examination reveals congested lungs, heart sounds with regular rhythm, mild abdominal distension, hypoactive bowel sounds, and no edema in the extremities. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.0%, platelet count (Plt) of 47 K/uL, blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.03 ng/mL, lactate level of 2.5 mmol/L, albumin level of 2.5 g/dL, and lactic acid level of 2.5 mmol/L. Imaging studies show right-sided pleural effusions and infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has respiratory failure due to pneumonia and effusions. The plan is to wean the patient off the ventilator as tolerated, continue antibiotic therapy, focus on comfort care, and diuresis as tolerated. The patient's abdominal distension and diarrhea may be managed by holding tube feeds. The patient's medical history includes a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and dementia. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he will remain in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an intubated, unresponsive individual with congested lungs and mild abdominal distension.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 to 132/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain relief.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,525 mL with outputs totaling 572 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,953 mL.
- Respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 375 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function.
- Imaging shows right-sided pleural effusions and infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- The patient's medical history includes a stroke, dementia, and abdominal distension with diarrhea.
- The plan is to wean off the ventilator as tolerated, continue antibiotic therapy, focus on comfort care, diuresis, and stop levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) vs. aspiration pneumonia with right-sided effusion. The patient developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. She has been recently admitted and discharged from another hospital unit for treatment of HAP.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and hypotension (not shock). The patient's past medical history includes CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.3Â°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/51 mmHg to 130/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 340 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 81, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 16 cmH2O, and end-tidal carbon"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 91-year-old woman with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. She was previously treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP) with right-sided effusion. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, but she experienced hypotension and required fluid boluses. She also had impaired skin integrity, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had acute respiratory failure due to aspiration, which required intubation. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 10 cmH2O.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has erythematous plaques on her torso, mostly under the breasts, axilla, and groin. This indicates possible skin breakdown or pressure ulcers.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 99% on supplemental oxygen, indicating some degree of hypoxemia.

4. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has a persistent low-grade fever, suggesting an underlying infection or inflammatory process.

5. Cardiac Failure: The patient has known cardiac failure with recent worsening mitral regurgitation (MR). She may have experienced an acute cardiac event during respiratory distress. Her blood pressure remains low, and she requires fluid boluses.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia with right-sided effusion. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. The patient also has a history of cardiac failure, anemia, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cmH2O, and RSBI 81. ABG results are not available. She has wheezes on the right anterior chest.
- Cardiovascular: The patient has impaired left ventricular function with a new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR). Troponin and CK levels are negative, and there are no signs of ST elevation on EKG. The patient is no longer requiring pressors for blood pressure support, and lactate levels have improved. Outpatient beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are being held due to low blood pressure.
- Hematologic: The patient has anemia with a decrease in hemoglobin from 29 to 24 g/dL, likely related to IV fluids and possible suppression of sepsis. Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
- Infection: The patient may have a possible UTI with yeast in her urine on [**5-9**]. Foley catheter will be changed, and urine output will be monitored.
- Rheumatoid arthritis: Azathioprine is being held due to infection.
- Osteoporosis: Outpatient calcium and vitamin D supplementation will continue.
- Goals of care: Discussion with the family over the weekend is planned to discuss goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and use of central lines increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Intensive care unit (ICU) stay and use of corticosteroids may predispose the patient to stress ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization, there is a risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac failure and new regional wall abnormality increase the risk of further cardiac complications.
6. Anemia exacerbation: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate nutritional support.
7. UTI: The patient's Foley catheter and possible yeast infection indicate a risk of UTI.
8. Pressure ulcers: P"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left-sided paralysis, who was initially admitted for fevers and hypoxia suspected to be secondary to pneumonia/sepsis. She has now returned to the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is attributed to sepsis and recurrent aspiration. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

She is receiving multiple medications including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin sodium. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 92/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low potassium, and normal liver function tests. Other lab values such as glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and lactic acid levels are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, no jugular venous distention, regular heart rhythm, warm extremities, and no rash or jaundice. Neurologically, she is sedated, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and has normal muscle tone.

The patient's current plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, work towards spontaneous"

- Temperature: 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F)
- Heart rate: 71 bpm
- Blood pressure: 92/43 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on room air

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including sepsis attributed to aspiration pneumonia, hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, and respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and aspiration. She also has a history of dementia, remote CVA with left hemiparesis, rheumatoid arthritis, and abdominal distention.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as electrolytes, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal ranges.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing mechanical ventilation, working towards spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), monitoring for signs of infection, managing hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   .
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**5-12**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT and ultrasound
   .
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - will hold patient's metoprolol for now so as not to mask tachycardic
   response
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sundowning in this elderly gentleman who has been to
   multiple hospitals and received IV narcotics.  Would also be concerned
   about CO2 retention given smoking history.  Although altered mental
   status can be a marker of worsening cholangitis, he has not shown
   evidence of septic physiology, so this is less likely the culprit.
   Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH is in differential.
   - CT Head to rule out bleed
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - check ABG
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   - SSI for now, but may need long acting insulin if sugars are poorly
   controlled
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED
   - recheck ABG with lactate
   .
   # Nausea:
   Likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.  However, given
   that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary disease, this can be a
   sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - check cardiac biomarkers in AM
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - holding beta blocker as above
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - restarted statin given elevated LFTs
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) 1187**] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   - restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor
   .
   # h/o Prostate CA:  resolved, per pt

","Based on the provided progress notes, the patient is a 77-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a history of cholecystectomy. He presented with RUQ pain and was diagnosed with cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP, which showed stones in the bile duct, and a stent was placed. The patient also has acute respiratory failure requiring intubation due to aspiration pneumonia and a right-sided pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cholangitis: The patient's RUQ pain and elevated liver function tests indicate an infection in the biliary tract. If left untreated, cholangitis can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there is a concern for septic shock or cardiac failure. Close monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation are required to maintain hemodynamic stability.
4. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of CAD and recent worsening of mitral regurgitation (MR). Acute cardiac events can occur during respiratory distress, leading to further compromise in cardiac function.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's immob"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia, but developed respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has a known history of cardiac failure with recent worsening of mitral regurgitation (MR). She also has a history of anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, hypotension, fever, and altered nutrition. The respiratory distress is likely due to aspiration pneumonia, which is a common complication in patients with impaired swallowing and cough reflexes. The hypotension may be caused by septic physiology and cardiac failure. The fever could be of unknown origin or related to an infection.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam, but developed a rash thought to be an allergic reaction to vancomycin. The antibiotic regimen has been adjusted accordingly.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) in the 80s, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 70s to 100s, respiratory rate (RR) around 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 98%. The temperature is within normal range.

","The patient is a 91-year-old woman with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA who was being treated for HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. She has been admitted and discharged from Hospital Unit 4 for treatment of HAP. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, hypotension, fever, altered nutrition, hypoxemia, cardiac failure, abdominal distension, anemia, possible UTI, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and previous episode of acute respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Cardiac Failure: The patient has a history of cardiac failure with recent worsening of mitral regurgitation (MR). The ECHO findings of new regional wall abnormality suggest a possible acute cardiac event during respiratory distress.
3. Infection: The patient's recent treatment for HAP and current symptoms of fever indicate a risk of infection. There is also a concern for possible UTI due to yeast in the urine.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Abdominal Distension: The patient's diarrhea raises concern for possible small bowel obstruction (SBO).
6. Hypotension: The patient's persistently low blood pressure may indicate ongoing septic physiology or cardiac"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) vs. aspiration pneumonia (AP) and developed respiratory failure, leading to intubation. She also has a large right-sided pleural effusion and diastolic heart failure. 

The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid boluses, indicating possible septic physiology. There is also evidence of cardiac failure with recent worsening of mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient has anemia, which is stable and likely due to anemia of chronic disease. She has a maculopapular rash, likely caused by a drug reaction, resulting in the discontinuation of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. 

There are concerns about the patient's nutrition, as she has difficulty swallowing. Her Foley catheter was changed due to the presence of yeast in her urine. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress has led to acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation, suggesting possible septic shock or"

The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. They are exhibiting a diffuse maculopapular rash on their trunk, back, arms, and legs. The abdomen remains distended, but there are no remarkable findings in the kidneys or bladder pressure. The patient has a history of allergies to vancomycin and has received antibiotics such as levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/70 mmHg to 142/118 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their bladder pressure is 12 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and other medications. They have been given tube feeds and parenteral nutrition. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of a rash.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, a warm skin temperature, and the presence of a diffuse maculopapular rash. Neurological examination shows flaccid left tone, but no other significant findings. Lab results indicate"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) vs. aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. She also has impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and hypotension. The patient has a history of cardiac failure with recent worsened mitral regurgitation (MR) and an acute event during respiratory distress. There are concerns about possible UTI, abdominal distension, anemia, maculopapular rash, and osteoporosis.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and a respiratory system resistance compliance index (RSBI) of 128. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 108/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.5 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 117 mg/dL, and sodium (Na+) of 142 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's medications include fentanyl, midazolam, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, furosemide, scopolamine patch, albuterol/ipratropium nebs prn, and Lasix. She has been weaned off vancomycin due to a rash and is now only receiving 7 out of 8 doses. Piperacillin/tazobactam has also been discontinued.

The patient's plan includes continuing respiratory support, monitoring for possible UTI, assessing for improvement in hypotension, managing cardiac failure, and addressing abdominal distension."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP) with right-sided effusion. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and cardiac failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving tube feeds, and has a rash with suspected drug reaction. She also has anemia, abdominal distension with diarrhea, and a possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's goals of care include discussing re-intubation with the family. The ICU care plan includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) and is currently on bedrest in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of cardiac function, development of sepsis or septic shock, progression of skin integrity impairment, worsening of nutritional status, and complications related to the presence of a Foley catheter.

The patient's clinical status should be closely monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted with HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia and developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She has been treated for HAP and recently discharged from Hospital Unit 4. The patient is currently in the ICU for treatment of respiratory distress, hypotension, cardiac failure, abdominal distension, anemia, and maculopapular rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced acute respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory distress.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a maculopapular rash with signs of possible fungal infection. This may lead to skin breakdown and potential wound infections.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is at risk for hypoxemia due to impaired gas exchange.
4. Cardiac Failure: The patient has a history of cardiac failure with recent worsening mitral regurgitation (MR). There is a risk of further cardiac decompensation and fluid overload.
5. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be related to sepsis or cardiac issues. This could lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential multi-organ dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking individual with a history of dementia, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and left-sided paralysis. They are currently experiencing respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. They also have hypotension likely due to sepsis and hypovolemia, as well as a remote history of CVA resulting in left hemiparesis. The patient's abdomen is distended, but further evaluation is needed. The patient also has dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, and requires nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications with mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of aspiration pneumonia is not effectively managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could progress if the source of infection (aspiration pneumonia) is not adequately treated, leading to further systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Hypotension: Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is crucial to ensure adequate organ perfusion. If hypotension persists or worsens, it may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. CVA: The patient's pre-existing left hemiparesis from a previous CVA may worsen if there is any new cerebral insult or if the current condition leads to further complications.
5. Abdominal Distension: The cause"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking individual with dementia, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left-sided paralysis, and aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by sepsis and recurrent aspiration.
- The patient received a completed course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and sepsis.
- Hypotension is being monitored, and efforts are being made to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
- The patient has a history of remote CVA with baseline left hemiparesis.
- Abdominal distention is present, but further evaluation is needed.
- The patient has dementia and is poorly communicative.
- Rheumatoid arthritis is noted but not receiving acute therapy.
- Nutritional support through tube feeding (TF) has been resumed.
- Goals of treatment and care need to be better defined.
- ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, multilumen lines, PICC line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. Continuing mechanical ventilation and working towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) is necessary. The patient's limited progress to date suggests a high risk of persistent respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Work towards SBT, but
   limited progress to date.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 TF resumed.
   Need to better define goals of treatment and care.

   condition.  Answered all questions.  Daughter understands pt. exhibited
   limited progress since current hospitalization.  At this time
   considering direction of future care.  Daughter wishes to discuss with
   other family members prior to making final decision regarding continue
   with trach/PEG and rehabilitation, or whether to move towards
   extubation and comfort.  At this time the HCP Daughter believes pt.
   would not want tracheostomy tube, but she wishes to confer with family
   members prior to final decision.
   Currently, pt. remains DNR (no CPR), but will continue mechanical
   ventilation and current level of care until health care proxy decision

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking male with a history of dementia and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and sepsis.
- The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with limited progress towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).
- The patient has completed courses of piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin for sepsis.
- The patient is also experiencing hypotension, attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, and abdominal distention without a clear cause.
- Other medical conditions include remote CVA with left hemiparesis, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and is critically ill.
- The healthcare proxy wishes to discuss future care options, including tracheostomy and rehabilitation versus extubation and comfort measures, with other family members before making a final decision.
- The patient will continue on the current level of care until the healthcare proxy decision is made later this week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there is a delay in weaning off mechanical ventilation or if there is an infection or other complications.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient has completed courses of antibiotics, there is still a risk of sepsis recurrence if the source of infection is"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia with right-sided effusion when she developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has impaired gas exchange as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of hypercarbia.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a maculopapular rash likely due to a drug reaction, with an overlying fungal infection in the intertriginous zones.

3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has abdominal distension but is able to stool, ruling out small bowel obstruction. She is currently receiving tube feeds.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube and has a PaO2 of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation.

5. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is stable overnight with no fluid bolus required. Her hypotension is likely related to sepsis and cardiac failure.

6. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO, Hypothermia, Pyrexia): The patient has a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.2Â°F) at her maximum.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old woman with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP). The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure and hypercarbia. She has a large right-sided pleural effusion and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has been experiencing hypotension. She also has impaired skin integrity, fever of unknown origin, hypoxemia, and altered nutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypercarbia required intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if she develops ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or if the effusion worsens.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a maculopapular rash, which could be due to a drug reaction or an underlying infection. Proper wound care and antifungal cream should be administered to prevent further skin breakdown.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's fever could be indicative of an ongoing infection or sepsis. Further investigation is required to identify the source of the fever.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which can be a result of her respiratory failure and the pleural effusion. Oxygen therapy may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

5. Altered Nutrition: The patient's ability to receive adequate nutrition may be compromised due to her impaired swallowing and aspiration risk. Nutritional support should be provided through alternative means such as tube feeds.

6. Cardiac Failure: The patient has known cardiac failure with recent worsening of mitral regurgitation (MR). Close monitoring of her cardiac status and diuresis is essential to manage her heart failure symptoms.

7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has experienced hypotension. This could be related to sepsis or her underlying cardiac condition. Close monitoring of fluid balance and blood pressure is necessary.

8. Possible Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's Foley catheter was changed due to the presence of yeast in the urine. Adequate urine output should be maintained, and appropriate antibiotic treatment may be required.

9. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient's rheumatoid arthritis medication, azathioprine, should be held until the infection is resolved.

10. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis, and her outpatient calcium and vitamin D supplementation should be continued.

11. Goals of Care: The patient's family wishes to discuss extubation on Sunday when their son arrives from overseas. It is important to consider the patient's wishes and the potential risks and benefits of continued mechanical ventilation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking individual with a history of dementia and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), resulting in left-sided paralysis. They are currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure due to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. Continued monitoring and mechanical ventilation will be necessary to support breathing.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Although a completed course of antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin) has been administered, close monitoring for signs of infection and potential septic shock is crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is essential to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
4. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient has a history of CVA, which has caused left hemiparesis. Regular monitoring for any changes in neurological status is necessary.
5. Abdominal Distention: The patient exhibits abdominal distention, likely due to the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter. Monitoring the examination and addressing any potential issues related to bladder pressure is important.
6. Dementia: The patient has"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA (stroke), dementia, and RA (rheumatoid arthritis). She was being treated for HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) and aspiration pneumonia with a right-sided effusion. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. 

The patient has been admitted and discharged from another hospital unit for treatment of HAP. She has a known history of HAP and aspiration pneumonia. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. She is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and an FiO2 of 40%. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.28, indicating respiratory acidosis.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, specifically a maculopapular rash likely due to a drug reaction with an overlying fungal infection in intertriginous zones. The rash is stable but requires antifungal cream and hygiene/wound care. 

She also has an alteration in nutrition and is currently receiving fiber source HN full strength. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/65 mmHg to 140/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 of"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP), but developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. The patient also has a large effusion and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 120/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 337 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 28 mmHg, and PaO2 of 74 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals rales bilaterally, decreased bowel sounds, and 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities. The patient has a maculopapular rash, likely due to a drug reaction, and is on antifungal cream and wound care. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 117 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.1 mEq/L, and elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, history of CVA, dementia, hypotension (not in shock), fever of unknown origin, and cardiac failure. 

The patient's plan of care includes continuing tube feeds, daily ASA, diuresis as tolerated, holding outpout beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers due to recent hypotension, and applying antifungal cream and wound care to the maculopapular rash. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Work towards SBT, but
   limited progress to date.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Evolving to blisters.  Plan Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and
   specialized bed (to limit skin contact).
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking individual with a history of dementia, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and left-sided paralysis. The patient was admitted with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient developed a severe rash attributed to a drug reaction, likely penicillin. The rash has progressed to blisters and is being treated with silver sulfadiazine ointment and specialized bed linens.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/44 mmHg to 132/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The kidney function tests indicate some abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains unable to wean off mechanical ventilation due to sepsis and recurrent aspiration.
2. Sepsis: Attributed to aspiration pneumonia, treated with empirical piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.
3. Hypotension: Attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, with ongoing monitoring and maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
4. CVA: Remote event with baseline left-sided hemipares"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Work towards SBT, but
   limited progress to date.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Evolving to blisters.  Plan Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and
   specialized bed (to limit skin contact).

- The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking male with dementia, who has been admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left-sided paralysis.
- The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.
- The patient has developed a severe rash attributed to a drug reaction, likely penicillin, which is evolving into blisters.
- The patient has hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.
- The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis but is not receiving acute therapy for it.
- The patient's nutritional support has been resumed, including fiber source enteral feeding.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen if there is no improvement in his respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to aspiration pneumonia. If not properly managed, it can lead to further complications and organ dysfunction.
3. Drug Reaction: The patient has developed a severe rash attributed to a drug reaction. If the reaction worsens or spreads to other areas of the body, it can cause additional skin complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis and hyp"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking individual with dementia and a history of a previous stroke resulting in residual left-sided paralysis. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has completed a course of empirical antibiotic therapy (Pip/Tazo) for sepsis and vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia.

The patient also has hypotension, which is being monitored and managed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient's prior stroke has resulted in baseline left hemiparesis.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing abdominal distention, which has been evaluated through a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) examination but has not revealed any significant findings. The abdominal distention is being monitored, and the patient's overall exam is stable.

The patient has a rash that is believed to be a drug reaction, possibly related to penicillin. The patient's dementia is noted as a baseline condition and is poorly communicative.

The patient also has rheumatoid arthritis, but no acute therapy is being provided for this condition.

Nutritional support is being provided through Fibersource HN (Full), which was resumed on [**2171-5-17**] at 04:49 AM at a rate of 45 mL/hour.

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of HAP and developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, leading to intubation. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, hypoxemia, fever, and multiple comorbidities including cardiac failure, anemia, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further deterioration in lung function.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a maculopapular rash progressing to blisters, which may be due to a drug reaction. This could lead to secondary infections and compromised wound healing.
3. Cardiac Failure: The patient has evidence of new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation. There is a risk of worsening cardiac function and potential complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Monitoring of hemoglobin and iron studies is recommended.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis and is on outpatient calcium and vitamin D supplementation. There is a risk of fractures due to weakened bones.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient has a history of hypoxemia, which can lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure, hypercarbia, and required intubation. She has a large pleural effusion and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to an acute episode of respiratory distress likely related to aspiration. She has been treated with levofloxacin and later switched to midazolam and fentanyl for sedation. Her allergies include vancomycin and Zosyn, both of which caused rashes. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has pitting edema in both lower extremities. Her lab results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and anemia of chronic disease. The patient has impaired skin integrity with a maculopapular rash that is likely a drug reaction with overlying fungal infection. She also has an alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and a history of CVA and dementia. The patient's goals of care include readdressing extubation on Sunday when her son arrives from overseas. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and requirement for intubation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure"

   - scopolamine patch for secretions to reduce aspiration risk
   - restart albuterol, ipratropium nebs prn wheezing
   - aspiration precautions
   - diuresis as tolerated, minimize fluids as pt positive 17L for length
   of stay, will give 40 mg Lasix x1 this morning
   - stop daily CXR, will order if pt clinically changes
   # Cardiac Failure: ECHO this admission demonstrates new regional wall
   abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST
   elevation. Most likely suffered acute event during respiratory
   distress. UOP decreasing.
   - BP WNL, however monitor for hypotension, outpatient BPs held
   - daily ASA
   - diuresis as tolerated
   # Abdominal distension: pt remains distended but with nl KUB on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) vs. aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with right-sided effusion. The patient developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. She also has impaired skin integrity, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and an altered nutrition status.

The patient's medical history includes a recent admission and discharge from another hospital unit for treatment of HAP, a large effusion, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She experienced an acute episode of respiratory distress, which required intubation and is believed to be related to aspiration. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as demonstrated by a new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR) on the echocardiogram. Troponin and CK levels are negative, and there is no ST elevation on the EKG.

The patient's abdominal distension remains present, but with normal kidney function on 05/13. She continues to experience anemia, which is stable and consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies have been ordered. The patient also has a maculopapular rash, likely due to a drug reaction with an overlying fungal infection in intertriginous zones. Antifungal cream and hygiene/wound care have been"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  Plan to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Evolving to blisters.  Plan Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and
   specialized bed (to limit skin contact).
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 91-year-old woman with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) vs. aspiration pneumonia and developed respiratory failure with hypercarbia, leading to intubation. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, hypotension (not in shock), fever of unknown origin, and acute cardiac failure.

The patient's current plan includes continuing on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 8 cmH2O and 40% FiO2, placement of a tracheostomy, scopolamine patch for secretions to reduce aspiration risk, nebulized albuterol and ipratropium as needed for wheezing, aspiration precautions, and chest X-ray if clinically indicated.

Regarding cardiac failure, the patient's ECHO shows new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR). Troponin and CK levels are negative, and there is no ST elevation on EKG. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but it will be monitored for hypotension, and daily aspirin will be given. Diuresis will be initiated as tolerated due to the positive fluid balance.

The patient also has abdominal distension, stable anemia, and a maculopapular rash. Iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease. The rash"

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA. She was admitted for treatment of HAP and aspiration pneumonia, requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and hypotension. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, diuretics, and antifungal cream. The family's goal is to address extubation on Sunday when their son arrives from overseas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypercarbia have led to the need for intubation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or complications associated with mechanical ventilation.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has diffuse erythema over the trunk and extremities with areas of desquamation and blistering. This indicates potential skin breakdown or pressure ulcers, which can be exacerbated by immobility and poor nutrition.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's ability to receive proper nutrition is compromised due to impaired swallowing and the use of a PEG tube. Nutritional deficiencies may lead to further complications such as poor wound healing and weakened immune system.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels can indicate inadequate oxygen supply to tissues. Prolonged hypoxemia can result in tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 91-year-old woman with a history of CVA (stroke), dementia, and RA (rheumatoid arthritis) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypercarbia. She has been treated for HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with ongoing diuresis using lasix as tolerated. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4 C (99.4 F)
- Heart rate: 112 bpm (normal range: 102-133 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 106/49 mmHg (with fluctuations)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (normal range: 17-23 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 40%
- Sinus tachycardia on EKG

The patient has a history of CVA, dementia, RA, and osteoporosis. She was recently discharged from another hospital unit for treatment of HAP and readmitted due to respiratory distress. The respiratory distress episode required intubation and is likely related to aspiration. 

The patient's current medications include midazolam (versed), fentanyl, and lasix. She has allergies to vancomycin and Zosyn (piperacillin sodium/tazobactam), both of"

   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  As per family, plan to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Diffuse erythema, evolving to blisters. Mucosa not involved.   Plan
   Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and specialized bed (to limit
   skin contact).
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.

","The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking male with a history of dementia and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and severe rash attributed to a drug reaction. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. 

Key findings include:
- Respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. Limited progress to date, and plans to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
- Severe rash due to a suspected drug reaction, likely penicillin. The plan is to apply silver sulfadiazine ointment to the affected areas and use a specialized bed to limit skin contact.
- Sepsis attributed to aspiration pneumonia, which has been treated with a completed course of empirical piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin. Monitoring off antibiotics.
- Hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) is recommended, aiming for a value above 60 mmHg.
- Remote history of CVA with baseline left hemiparesis.
- Abdominal distention without clear cause, with acceptable bladder pressure. Monitoring is advised.
- Dementia is a baseline condition, and there are no acute therapies planned for rheumatoid arthritis.
- Nutritional support, including tube feeding (TF), is resumed.
- ICU care includes glycemic control, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and prophylaxis for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted for treatment of HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, leading to intubation. The patient has impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, hypotension, and anemia. She also has a history of cardiac failure with regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation, abdominal distension, maculopapular rash, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. The patient's goals of care are DNR, and a family meeting will be held to reassess whether the patient should be extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a maculopapular rash with overlying fungal infection. This indicates impaired skin integrity, which can lead to further infections or complications. Proper wound care and hygiene should be maintained.
3. Cardiac Failure: The patient has a history of cardiac failure with new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation. Continuous monitoring of cardiac function and fluid balance is essential to prevent exacerbation of cardiac failure.
4. Abdominal Distension: The patient remains distended but"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress note and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypercarbia due to HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia. She required intubation and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 40%. She has a large effusion and diastolic CHF. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and slightly elevated CRP. She also has impaired skin integrity, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced respiratory failure requiring intubation. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and fever suggest a possible infection. Close monitoring for any signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if needed.
3. Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity with rashes and blisters. Proper wound care and hygiene measures should be taken to prevent further complications such as infection.
4. Cardiac Failure: The patient has evidence of cardiac failure with diastolic CHF. Monitoring of her cardiac status and managing her fluid balance are important to prevent worsening of cardiac function.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. The patient has been treated for HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia and has a large effusion and diastolic CHF. She developed acute respiratory distress and required intubation, which is believed to be related to aspiration. The patient's condition has been stable, with no acute events. She is awaiting a tracheostomy evaluation and is on mechanical ventilation with PSV 8/5 and FiO2 40%. The family is considering a tracheostomy and surgery at another hospital if they decide to proceed. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there are complications with the mechanical ventilation or if she develops further respiratory infections.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a maculopapular rash with overlying fungal infection in intertriginous zones. This condition may progress or lead to additional skin breakdown if not properly managed.

3. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which can be exacerbated by fluid loss through insensible routes due to the skin condition. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.

4. Fever, Unknown Origin: The patient has a fever of unknown origin, indicating a potential underlying infection or inflammatory process.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  As per family, plan to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Diffuse erythema, evolving to blisters. Mucosa not involved.   Plan
   Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and specialized bed (to limit
   skin contact).  Improving.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese speaking male with dementia and a history of prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is now experiencing aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has severe rash attributed to a drug reaction, sepsis due to aspiration pneumonia, hypotension, and chronic left-sided paralysis from a previous CVA. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is planned for tracheostomy tube placement. His condition remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.
2. Sepsis: With ongoing infection and inflammation, the patient is at risk of developing septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and potentially death.
3. Hypotension: Persistent hypotension can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential ischemic damage to vital organs.
4. Drug Reaction: The severe rash caused by a drug reaction may progress to more serious complications like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.
5. Aspiration Pneumonia: Continued aspiration of gastric contents can worsen lung injury and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially dislodge"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  As per family, plan to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Diffuse erythema, evolving to blisters. Mucosa not involved.   Plan
   Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and specialized bed (to limit
   skin contact).  Improving.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking individual with dementia and prior history of CVA, presenting with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to ongoing respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and recurrent aspiration.
- Family plans to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
- The patient has a severe rash attributed to a drug reaction (likely penicillin), which is improving with the application of Silvidine ointment and specialized bed.
- The patient was treated for sepsis secondary to aspiration pneumonia with a completed course of antibiotics (Pip/Tazo and Vanco).
- Hypotension is being monitored and maintained with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 60 mmHg.
- The patient has a history of CVA, resulting in left-sided paralysis.
- Abdominal distention is present but without significant findings on examination.
- The patient has dementia and is poorly communicative.
- Rheumatoid arthritis is present but not currently receiving acute therapy.
- Nutritional support in the form of tube feeds (TF) has been resumed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure indicates a high risk of continued difficulty in breathing and potential complications such as pneumonia or further deterioration in lung function.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient has completed a course of antibiotics, there is still a risk of sepsis-related complications due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP) with a right-sided pleural effusion. The patient developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. She also has impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension (not in shock), fever of unknown origin, dementia, CVA, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and anemia.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 8/5, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) 40%, scopolamine patch for secretions to reduce aspiration risk, albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed for wheezing, aspiration precautions, and chest X-ray if clinically indicated.

For cardiac failure, the plan is to monitor blood pressure and follow up with an echocardiogram (ECHO) to evaluate for new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR). Troponin and CK levels are negative, and no ST elevation is observed on the EKG. The patient's urine output (UOP) is adequate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) vs. aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. The patient has been admitted and discharged from another hospital unit for treatment of HAP. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated lung injury, and barotrauma.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a maculopapular rash with a fungal infection in intertriginous zones. There is a risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is tube-fed, but there may be issues with feeding tolerance and risk of aspiration.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening hypoxemia and potential need for increased FiO2.
5. Cardiac Failure: The patient has evidence of new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram. There is a risk of further cardiac deterioration and heart failure.
6. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, most likely due to chronic disease. There is a risk of"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA), as well as a large pleural effusion and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress, which is likely related to aspiration. She also has impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and hypotension not in shock.

The patient's cardiac status includes evidence of new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram, but troponin and CK levels are negative. There are no ST elevations on EKG, suggesting an acute cardiac event during respiratory distress. The patient's abdominal distension is present but with normal kidney ureter bladder (KUB) on 05/13, and bowel sounds are present with ongoing stooling. 

The patient has stable anemia, with iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease. She also has a resolving maculopapular rash likely due to a drug reaction with fungal infection in intertriginous zones. Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis are chronic conditions being managed on an outpatient basis.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  As per family, plan to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
   Check pre-op CXR, PT, PTT,plts, T&S.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Diffuse erythema, evolving to blisters. Mucosa not involved.   Plan
   Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and specialized bed (to limit
   skin contact).  Much improved.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 TF resumed.  Hold tonight for trach in AM.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking individual with a history of dementia and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is now experiencing aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and sepsis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Sepsis and Infection: The patient's current sepsis may progress to septic shock if not properly managed. Additionally, the patient is at risk for developing new infections due to the use of invasive lines and tubes.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, needs close monitoring to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and prevent further drops in blood pressure.

4. Drug Reactions: The patient has developed a severe rash attributed to a drug reaction, likely caused by penicillin. Monitoring for any signs of worsening skin reactions is essential.

5. Nutritional Support: The patient requires nutritional support, and there is a plan to resume tube feeds. Ensuring proper nutrition is vital for the patient's recovery.

6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CVA puts him at risk for cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  As per family, plan to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
   Check pre-op CXR, PT, PTT,plts, T&S.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Diffuse erythema, evolving to blisters. Mucosa not involved.   Plan
   Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and specialized bed (to limit
   skin contact).  Much improved.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking male with a history of dementia, prior cerebrovascular accident (residual left-sided paralysis), and current aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and aspiration. The patient has severe rash attributed to a drug reaction (likely penicillin) and is planned for tracheotomy tube placement. Other medical complications include hypotension, remote cerebrovascular accident (CVA), abdominal distention, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's condition remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. Continued monitoring and mechanical ventilation will be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for sepsis attributed to aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring off antibiotics will be required.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension likely due to sepsis and hypovolemia. Continuous monitoring and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg will be essential.
4. Remote Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient has a history of a remote CVA resulting in left-sided paralysis. Monitoring for any neurological changes will be necessary.
5. Abdominal Distention: The patient has abdominal distention with unrevealing KUB (kidneys, ureters, and bladder). Monitoring"

","The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. The patient has been admitted and discharged from the hospital unit for treatment of HAP. She is currently experiencing respiratory distress, likely related to aspiration, and requires volume assist ventilation. A bedside tracheostomy is planned for May 22nd, and chest X-ray, coagulation studies, and blood tests have been ordered.

The patient also has cardiac failure, with an echocardiogram showing new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation. Troponin and CK levels are negative, and there is no ST elevation on the EKG. This suggests that the patient may have suffered an acute event during respiratory distress. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but will be monitored for hypotension. Daily aspirin therapy has been initiated, and the patient's urine output and fluid balance will be closely monitored.

The patient has abdominal distension, but with normal kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) on May 13th. Bowel sounds are present, and the patient is still stooling. Tube feeds will continue, and iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Hemoglobin and total serum iron levels will be monitored, and testing will be active until May"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of HAP and aspiration pneumonia but developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. The patient has impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as indicated by new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation seen on an echocardiogram. The troponin and CK levels are negative, suggesting that the cardiac event occurred during the respiratory distress. The patient is at risk for further cardiac failure, and close monitoring of blood pressure and daily administration of aspirin are recommended.

The patient also has abdominal distension but is able to stool normally. Tube feeds will be continued, and daily monitoring of bowel sounds and KUB will be performed.

The patient has anemia, which is stable and most likely due to anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies are consistent with this diagnosis, and monitoring of H/H and T&S will continue.

The patient previously experienced a maculopapular rash that is resolving and was likely due to a drug reaction. Antifungal cream will be continued for hygiene and wound care.

The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. Azathioprine will be held, and outpatient calcium and vitamin D"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, leading to intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, cardiac failure, abdominal distension, anemia, maculopapular rash, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypercarbia required intubation. If ventilation is inadequate or there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia, it could lead to worsening respiratory failure.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a desquamating rash, which indicates impaired skin integrity. Infection or further breakdown of the skin can occur if proper wound care is not maintained.

3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's feeding tube has been held due to the planned tracheostomy. If proper nutrition is not provided, it can lead to malnutrition and further complications.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 100%. However, if there is a decrease in oxygen delivery or increased oxygen demand, hypoxemia can occur, leading to tissue hypoxia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA, being treated for HAP versus aspiration pneumonia. She was recently admitted and discharged from the hospital for treatment of HAP. The patient developed respiratory distress and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. She has a known history of HAP, large effusion, and diastolic CHF. The acute episode of respiratory distress was likely related to aspiration. The patient is currently on PSV 8/5, post-levo, and Zosyn was discontinued due to rash (received 7 out of 8 doses). C-reactive protein (CRP) is negative. The patient is due for a tracheostomy on [**5-22**], with CXR, coags, and T&S ordered. She will continue on CMV/Vt=450/rate12/Peep 5/40% and change to PS as tolerated. The patient is also on scopolamine patch for secretions to reduce aspiration risk, nebs prn wheezing, and aspiration precautions.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation.
- They have impaired skin integrity, possibly due to bedridden status or pressure ulcers.
- There are alterations in nutrition, which may be contributing to poor glycemic control.
- Hypoxemia is present, indicating low oxygen levels in the blood.
- The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accidents (stroke, cerebral infarction) and dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct).
- Hypotension is observed, although not in shock.
- The patient has a fever of unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia).
- The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): This is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period. It occurs when bacteria infect the lungs due to the use of the ventilator.

2. Pressure ulcers: Due to the patient's impaired skin integrity and bedridden status, there is a risk of developing pressure ulcers. These ulcers can lead to infection and other complications if not managed properly.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prol"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  As per family, plan to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
   Check pre-op CXR, PT, PTT,plts, T&S.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Diffuse erythema, evolving to blisters. Mucosa not involved.   Plan
   Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and specialized bed (to limit
   skin contact).  Much improved.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yof Chinese speaking with dementia, prior CVA (residual left sided
   paralysis) now with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis and aspiration
   (recurrent).  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  As per family, plan to proceed with tracheotomy tube placement.
   Check pre-op CXR, PT, PTT,plts, T&S.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Diffuse erythema, evolving to blisters. Mucosa not involved.   Plan
   Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and specialized bed (to limit
   skin contact).  Much improved.
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 TF resumed.  Hold tonight for trach in AM.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking individual with dementia and a history of prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is currently experiencing aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.

The patient has a severe rash attributed to a drug reaction, likely penicillin. The rash has evolved from erythema to blisters but does not involve mucosa. The plan is to apply Silvidine ointment to the affected areas and use a specialized bed to minimize skin contact.

The patient also has sepsis due to aspiration pneumonia, for which the patient received a completed course of empirical piperacillin/tazobactam (Pip/Tazo) and vancomycin (Vanco). Now, the plan is to monitor off antibiotics.

The patient is experiencing hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.

Additionally, the patient has a remote history of CVA, resulting in baseline left hemiparesis. There are no acute therapies planned for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's abdominal distention is attributed to the unrevealing kidney/urinary bladder (KUB) exam, with acceptable bladder pressure. The plan is to monitor the exam.

The patient has dementia and is poorly communicative. There are no acute nutritional support interventions planned at this time"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and subsequently developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, which is not benign. It is important to monitor her blood pressure regularly and manage it appropriately.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and not associated with ARDS. She requires assisted ventilation and has undergone a tracheostomy. It is crucial to continue monitoring her respiratory status and adjust the ventilator settings as necessary.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a desquamating rash, which is improving since the last examination. It is important to continue wound care and hygiene in the affected areas to prevent further skin breakdown.

4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has abdominal distension but is still stooling normally. She remains distended and bowel sounds are present. It is important to continue tube feeds and monitor her nutritional status.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 100%, indicating adequate oxygenation. However, it is essential to continue monitoring her oxygen levels and provide supplemental oxygen if needed.

6. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has a temperature"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia with right-sided effusion and subsequently developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a known history of HAP pneumonia, large effusion, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She required intubation due to an acute episode of respiratory distress, which is likely related to aspiration. She is currently on volume assist ventilation.

2. Cardiac Failure: An echocardiogram during this admission showed new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation. Troponin and CK levels are negative, indicating no acute myocardial infarction. The patient likely suffered an acute cardiac event during respiratory distress. Monitoring for blood pressure, daily aspirin administration, and fluid balance is recommended.

3. Abdominal Distension: The patient remains distended but with normal kidney, ureter, and bladder findings on imaging. Bowel sounds are present, and she is still stooling. Continuing tube feeds and elevating the head of the bed is advised.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old Chinese-speaking male with a history of dementia and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and sepsis. The patient is mechanically ventilated and has undergone a tracheostomy. He also has a severe rash attributed to a drug reaction, possibly related to penicillin. Other medical issues include hypotension, hypertension, and chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to sepsis and aspiration. Continuous monitoring and mechanical ventilation are required.
2. Sepsis: The patient has completed a course of empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, but monitoring for any signs of recurrent sepsis is necessary.
3. Hypotension: Hypotension is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is essential.
4. CVA: The patient has a history of a remote cerebrovascular accident, resulting in left hemiparesis. This may contribute to difficulties in feeding and overall functional status.
5. Abdominal Distention: The patient has abdominal distention, which could be due to various causes, including ileus or constipation. Monitoring and appropriate interventions are needed.
6. Dementia: The patient has baseline poorly communicative dementia, which can complicate assessment and management.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly Chinese-speaking male with a history of dementia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left-sided paralysis, and aspiration pneumonia. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to sepsis and aspiration, for which he is being mechanically ventilated. The patient also has a severe rash attributed to a drug reaction, likely caused by penicillin. He has completed a course of antibiotics for sepsis and now requires monitoring off antibiotics. The patient's blood pressure is low, possibly due to sepsis and hypovolemia. His dementia is well-documented, and he has a history of rheumatoid arthritis but requires no acute therapy at this time. The patient has abdominal distention, which is being monitored, and he is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to sepsis and aspiration. Mechanical ventilation will continue, and there may be limited progress to date. A tracheostomy tube placement is planned.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP), with respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient also has cardiac failure, abdominal distension, anemia, maculopapular rash, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of HAP and AP, and she required intubation due to respiratory distress. There is a risk of further respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Cardiac failure: The patient has evidence of new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiography. This suggests a possible acute cardiac event during respiratory distress. Monitoring of blood pressure and daily use of aspirin are recommended.

3. Abdominal distension: The patient remains distended but with normal kidney function. There is a need to continue tube feeds and elevate the head of the bed.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Iron supplementation and monitoring of hemoglobin/hematocrit levels are advised.

5. Maculopapular rash: The rash is resolving, likely due to a drug reaction with fungal"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP), both of which can lead to respiratory distress and failure. The patient was intubated and required volume assist ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient has signs of infection such as fever, elevated white blood cell count, and crepitus near the tracheostomy site. The cultures are pending to identify the causative organism.

3. Cardiac failure: The patient has evidence of new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram. Troponin and CK levels are negative, indicating that the cardiac event may not be an acute myocardial infarction.

4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac causes. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors may be necessary.

5. Abdominal distension: The patient has abdominal distension, but there is no evidence of obstruction on imaging. Bowel sounds are present, and stooling continues.

6. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, likely due to anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies are consistent with this diagnosis.

7. Maculopapular rash: The patient had a macul"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to aspiration (recurrent) and
   effusions.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Limited progress to
   date.  Tracheotomy tube placed successfully.
   RASH
 Severe.  Attributed to drug reaction (likely penicillin).
   Diffuse erythema, evolving to blisters. Mucosa not involved.   Plan
   Silvidine ointment to involved areas, and specialized bed (to limit
   skin contact).  Much improved.
   Vomiting -
   SEPSIS --  attributed to aspiration pneuomonia --> empirical Pip/Tazo,
   Vanco --> now completed course.  Monitor off antibiotics
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue to
   monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CVA -- remote.  Baseline left hemiparesis.
   ABD DISTENTION -- KUB unrevealing, bladder pressure acceptable.
   Monitor exam.
   DEMENTIA -- baseline poorly communicative.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS -- no acute therapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to recurrent aspiration and effusions. A tracheostomy tube was successfully placed. The patient is also experiencing hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, as well as abdominal distention. The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable. The patient's renal function is normal, but there are some abnormalities in liver function tests. The patient has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated WBC count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Aspiration: The patient's recurrent aspiration increases the risk of further lung infections and respiratory complications.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal distention may lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and aspiration. The patient's condition has been complicated by a severe rash caused by a drug reaction, likely penicillin. The rash has evolved into blisters but does not involve the mucosa. The patient has completed a course of empirical antibiotics for sepsis and is now off antibiotics. Hypotension is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, and the patient's blood pressure needs to be monitored, maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient has a history of remote cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with left hemiparesis, abdominal distention, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. There are no acute therapies for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient has been receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have been implemented. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to sepsis and aspiration. Continuous monitoring and mechanical ventilation are necessary. Limited progress has been made to date.
2. Rash: The severe rash, caused by a drug reaction, needs to be managed with topical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of stroke, dementia, hypertension, and other comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute pain. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, pain control, and nutritional support. His vital signs are stable, but he has a fever and impaired skin integrity. The patient's lab results show abnormal values in different parameters such as WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, Glucose, and others. The patient's code status is DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which may require ongoing ventilatory support. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma should be monitored and managed promptly.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections. Regular turning and proper skin care are essential to prevent further complications.
3. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, indicating a possible infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent sepsis.
4. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, there is a risk of developing hypotension due to his comorbidities or medication side effects. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure adequate perfusion.
5. Hyperglycemia:"

","Summary:
The patient is an 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure attributed to aspiration and effusions. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left hemiparesis. The patient has been mechanically ventilated since admission, with a tracheostomy tube placed successfully. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection, but has developed a rash due to vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient experienced hypotension this morning, which was treated with intravenous fluids. He also presented with fever, vomiting after starting tube feeds, and abdominal distension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 116/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 81 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient has been kept nil per os (NPO) due to vomiting and ongoing assessment and treatment for his various conditions. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he will continue"

   Disposition:
","The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (117 bpm) and low blood pressure (108/77 mmHg). The respiratory rate is also high at 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 99%, indicating good oxygenation. The patient's weight has increased from 55 kg at admission to 65.5 kg currently.

The patient has oliguria/anuria with low urine output, ineffective coping due to family conflict regarding care decisions, pain control issues, hypertension, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, history of CVA (stroke), and dementia.

The patient is receiving various medications including midazolam (versed), heparin sodium, fentanyl, vancomycin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient is also on a ventilator with settings of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, Vt set at 400 mL, RR set at 14, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and RSBI of 162.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a range of 11.2-12.6 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 8.1 g/dL, normal platelet count (Plt) within the range of 433-"

   # Hypotension
 Blood pressure stabalized yesterday with adequate
   sedation.  Likely multifactorial, but possibilites include
   oversedation, sepsis, hypovolemia (although less likely due to fluid
   positive over hospital course) or cardiac causes.  Will evaluate for
   infection and monitor.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and dementia. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of respiratory failure, hypotension, and confusion. The patient underwent a tracheostomy tube placement and has been on mechanical ventilation due to recurrent aspiration and effusions.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 beats per minute, normal blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's weight has increased from 55 kg at admission to 65.5 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,076 mL since 12 AM, with total output of 800 mL including 700 mL of urine output. The patient's daily labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and increased platelet count. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing in the right lower lung field, abdominal distention with absent bowel sounds, and extreme 1+ edema. The patient is intubated, sedated, and unresponsive.

The patient's current assessment and plan include ongoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, continuation of antibiotics for 72 hours, and nasogastric tube decompression for vomiting due to ileus. The patient is also being given IV fluids as needed for hypotension,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure attributed to aspiration, effusions, and weakness. The patient has undergone a tracheotomy tube placement and is still on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 99%.

The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis but is not receiving acute therapy for it at this time. The patient's allergies include vancomycin and Zosyn (Piperacillin/Tazobactam), and he has received antibiotics such as meropenem.

The patient's recent lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values including creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient has been on various medications including midazolam, heparin, fentanyl, and antibiotics. His current plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, antibiotic therapy for 72 hours, and further evaluation and management of his conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and potential bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, infection parameters,"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple health issues. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, attributed to aspiration and effusions. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy tube has been placed successfully. Antibiotics have been continued for 72 hours.

The patient also has a rash that has improved, vomiting, hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, and CVA with dementia, resulting in left hemiparesis. The patient has abdominal distention, but the cause is unclear, as the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) imaging did not reveal any significant findings. The patient's bladder pressure is acceptable, so monitoring and keeping the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) is recommended.

Additionally, the patient has rheumatoid arthritis, but no acute therapy is required at this time.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition through Fibersource HN (Full) at 35 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being monitored, and the patient has multiple IV lines, including a PICC line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), indicating that the medical team will not perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) if"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and subsequently readmitted with respiratory distress, intubated, and underwent tracheostomy on 5/22. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, large effusion, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She required volume assist ventilation and is currently on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode. The patient's fever has subsided, white blood cell count remains elevated but stable, and she has been afebrile for the past 24 hours. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, midazolam, heparin sodium, and metoclopramide. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. It is important to monitor her oxygen saturation levels, respiratory rate, and ventilation parameters closely.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low urine output and previous episodes of hypotension suggest a potential for ongoing hypotension. Monitoring her blood pressure and adjusting fluid and medication administration accordingly is crucial.
3. Infection: With an elevated white blood cell count and possible sources of infection including HAP, aspiration pneumonia, tracheostomy site infection, and urinary tract infection,"

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of CVA (stroke), dementia, hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving IV antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) for the suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 100/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.1 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 2.5 mmol/L. The patient's urine output is low at 10-15cc/hr, and he is oliguric/anuric. The patient's pain is controlled with fentanyl IV bolus, and he is also receiving midazolam for sedation. The patient's family has made a DNR (do not resuscitate) decision, and the healthcare team is providing comfort care. Potential medical complications include respiratory failure, infection (due to aspiration pneumonia), impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, and impaired renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted for treatment of HAP and aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and was intubated, requiring volume assist ventilation. She underwent tracheostomy on 5/22 and has been on CMV since then. The patient's recent medical events include fever to 100.7 on 5/24, which prompted restarting vancomycin, but she has now been afebrile for 24 hours. Her white count remains elevated but stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output has been low, indicating possible kidney dysfunction or inadequate fluid balance.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is concern for possible sepsis, oversedation, hypovolemia, or cardiac causes contributing to her low blood pressure.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

4. Fever: Although the patient is currently afebrile, her recent spike in temperature suggests an ongoing infection. Possible sources include HAP, aspiration pneumonia, tracheostomy site infection, or urinary tract infection.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels may be affected due to her respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA. She was admitted for treatment of HAP vs. aspiration PNA with right-sided effusion and subsequently developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient underwent a tracheostomy on 5/22. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is experiencing respiratory distress due to aspiration. There are concerns about impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin. The patient has a history of CVA, dementia, RA, and is being treated for HAP vs. aspiration PNA. She is currently on multiple medications, including sedatives, antibiotics, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and inability to wean off mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or chronic ventilation-related complications.

2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and positive cultures suggest an ongoing infection. The possible sources of infection include HAP, aspiration PNA, emesis, tracheostomy site infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), or fever of unknown origin (FUO).

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure and decreased urine output may indicate hypotension. Possible causes include sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac causes.

   multifactorial, but possibilites include oversedation, sepsis,
   hypovolemia (although less likely due to fluid positive over hospital
   course) or cardiac causes.  Will evaluate for infection and monitor.
   Per HCP, pressors/central access ok.
   - consider pressors if pt becomes hypotensive again

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA, admitted to the ICU for treatment of HAP vs. aspiration PNA. She developed respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient underwent tracheostomy on 5/22 and is now on CMV ventilation. She has copious secretions and new trauma from suctioning. Her fever has resolved, and her white count remains elevated but stable. The patient is afebrile for 24 hours. Possible sources of infection include HAP due to chronic ventilation, aspiration PNA, emesis, tracheostomy site infection, urinary infection, or FUO. She is currently receiving Vanc and Meropenem, and if cultures are negative in 72 hours, they will be discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to aspiration pneumonia or tracheostomy site infection.
2. Infection: There are multiple possible sources of infection, including HAP, aspiration PNA, emesis, tracheostomy site infection, urinary infection, or FUO. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she may experience hypotension again due to oversedation, sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac causes. Pressors and central access may be considered if the patient becomes hypotensive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure attributed to aspiration, effusions, and weakness. He has undergone several interventions including tracheotomy tube placement, mechanical ventilation, and continuous antibiotics for 72 hours. The patient also has hypotension attributed to intravascular hypovolemia, and his medical history includes CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which is a common complication in ICU patients.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and intravenous lines increase the risk of developing DVT, a potentially serious condition that can lead to pulmonary embolism.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation can disrupt the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier, leading to stress ulcers. These ulcers can cause bleeding and may require treatment with proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or wound infections.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to intravascular hypovolemia, but it is important to monitor for other causes of low blood pressure such as medication effects or sepsis.
6. CVA/Dementia: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure attributed to aspiration, effusions, and weakness. He has undergone tracheotomy tube placement and continues on mechanical ventilation. The patient's negative culture data indicates stopping antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. He also has a urinary tract infection (UTI), for which he received three days of unspecified antibiotic therapy and will complete four days of Bactrim. The patient is experiencing ileus, and efforts are being made to introduce tube feedings while holding opiates and discontinuing scopolamine. Hypotension is attributed to intravascular hypovolemia, and intravenous fluids are given as needed. The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and dementia, resulting in left hemiparesis, and is taking aspirin as advised. Rheumatoid arthritis is noted but no acute therapy is required. In ICU care, nutrition will be restarted, glycemic control will be maintained, and appropriate lines and prophylaxis measures will be continued. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he will remain in the ICU for further work on placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary to prevent and promptly treat this condition.
2. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immob"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of aspiration, respiratory failure, tracheostomy, hypotension, CVA, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, and ileus. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's blood culture was positive for E. coli, but all antibiotics have been stopped due to negative culture data. The patient is also experiencing hypotension attributed to intravascular hypovolemia and is being given IV fluids as needed. The patient has a baseline left hemiparesis and is on aspirin for CVA/dementia. There are no acute therapies for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient has had an ileus and TFs (total parenteral nutrition) are being reintroduced while holding opiates and discontinuing scopolamine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and the risk of aspiration, there is a potential for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged exposure to hospital environment increase the risk of acquiring nos"

 Pressures stable over the lasts 24 hrs.  Urine output
   continues to be low.  Likely multifactorial, but possibilites include
   oversedation, sepsis, hypovolemia (although less likely due to fluid
   positive over hospital course) or cardiac causes.  Will evaluate for
   infection and monitor. Per HCP, pressors/central access ok.
   - no pressors if pt becomes hypotensive again
   - monitor UOP, bolus 500 ccs today

","Summary:
The patient is an 91-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke), dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia, and then readmitted with respiratory distress, intubated, and underwent tracheostomy on 5/22. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is being treated for multiple medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output has been low, which may indicate kidney dysfunction or inadequate fluid balance.
2. Ineffective Coping: The patient is sedated and nonresponsive, indicating potential issues with mental status or neurological function.
3. Pain Control (Acute Pain, Chronic Pain): The patient may be experiencing pain due to various factors such as immobility, tracheostomy, or underlying medical conditions.
4. Hypertension, Benign: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and need for intubation suggest a risk of respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia or other lung infections.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has maculopapular rash that resolved, likely due to a drug reaction, and there is a concern for fungal infection in intertriginous zones.

   - monitor UOP, diurese gently (goal -500cc over 24 hours)
   - wean sedation
   # Cardiac Failure: ECHO this admission demonstrates new regional wall
   abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST
   elevation. Most likely suffered acute event during respiratory
   distress.
   - daily ASA
   - monitor UOP and fluid balance.
   # Abdominal distension: s/p GJ-tube replacement this morning.  History
   of emesis, will re-start tubefeeds slowly and monitor abdominal exam
   closely.  Pt. stooling after miralax. Pt with visible ascites on
   bladder scan.
   - re-start feeds today at low volume
   - continue metoclopramide, bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis.
- She was initially admitted for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP).
- The patient developed respiratory failure and required intubation. A tracheostomy was performed on 05/22.
- She has a large pleural effusion and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient experienced an acute episode of respiratory distress, possibly related to aspiration, and required volume-assisted ventilation.
- Blood cultures were negative, and the patient was febrile due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli.
- The patient underwent a change in sedation to PO ativan and discontinued fentanyl.
- Aspiration precautions, elevation of the head of bed, and suctioning for secretions were also implemented.
- Family meetings were held regarding placement options.
- The patient has hypertension that is mostly related to sedation levels. Pressors or central venous access are not currently needed.
- An echocardiogram this admission showed new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR).
- Troponin and CK levels were negative, indicating no acute coronary event.
- The patient has abdominal distension, which may be due to emesis. A gastro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA who was being treated for HAP versus aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia, requiring intubation. The patient was recently admitted and discharged from a hospital unit for treatment of HAP and was readmitted with respiratory distress, intubated, and underwent a tracheostomy on 5/22. The patient has a new small bowel obstruction (SBO) and an ovarian mass confirmed by CT scan. She is NPO, with some stool output this morning but continues to be distended on exam. The family has been notified of the ovarian mass. The patient is a poor surgical candidate for surgery consultation. An ultrasound is planned to evaluate for ascites. The patient's J-tube is on gravity and G-tube is on suction. Electrolytes need to be replaced as needed. Tube feeds are being held for now. The patient requires volume assist ventilation and continues with bowel regimen, holding peristaltics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is decreased, which can be a sign of renal dysfunction or inadequate fluid balance.
2. Ineffective Coping: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may indicate difficulty in meeting physiological needs, leading to ineffective coping.
3. Pain Control (Acute Pain, Chronic Pain): The patient's acute pain management needs to be addressed,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypercarbia. She was treated for HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia and developed respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient had a tracheostomy performed on 5/22 and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She also has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and was started on Bactrim. The patient's blood pressure has been stable without the need for pressors, and her cardiac function is being monitored due to an abnormal echo showing regional wall abnormality and worsening mitral regurgitation. She also has abdominal distension, likely related to GJ-tube replacement, and is being re-started on tube feeds slowly. The patient has anemia but is stable, and her rash from Zosyn has resolved. She has a history of RA and osteoporosis, and her goals of care are DNR. She is currently in the ICU receiving care for various conditions including respiratory failure, UTI, cardiac failure, and abdominal distension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause of the failure is not addressed properly.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has an active UTI"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA. She was admitted for treatment of HAP versus aspiration pneumonia and developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient underwent a tracheostomy on 5/22 and has been stable except for recent GJ tube drainage and emesis following replacement of her GJ tube and feeding. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is significantly reduced, which may indicate kidney dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

2. Ineffective coping: The patient's sedation was weaned yesterday, but she remains non-responsive, indicating possible difficulty in coping with the current medical situation.

3. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient is experiencing acute pain due to various interventions and procedures, as well as chronic pain associated with her underlying conditions.

4. Hypertension, benign: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, but it is mentioned to be mostly related to the level of sedation. No specific intervention is required at this time.

5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress is likely related to aspiration pneumonia, which has led to acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed a maculopapular rash, which is likely a drug reaction with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including a history of stroke, dementia, and partial bowel obstruction. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and subsequent intubation. The patient has been experiencing oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping (family conflict), pain control, hypertension, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and other comorbidities such as CVA and dementia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. Her lab results show slightly elevated WBC count, low platelet count, and normal kidney function. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. She is also receiving tube feeds through a J-tube. The patient's family is in conflict with the decision of care, and social work consult has been done. The patient's code status is DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on AC (assisted ventilation) and has been struggling to wean off. There is a concern for possible aspiration pneumonia, and the patient is being prepared for rehab.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, but it is improving with ongoing care.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's tube feeds were temporarily stopped due to vomiting, but she has been restarted on continuous low suction through a J-tube. She also had diarrhea, which has resolved."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of CVA, dementia, and hypertension, admitted to the ICU with small bowel obstruction, acute respiratory failure, and other comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/58 mmHg to 143/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation with a tidal volume of 357 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 3,119 mL over the past 24 hours. Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's kidney function appears to be impaired with an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26.9 mg/dL and creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals no abdominal distension or tenderness. The neurologic examination shows preserved sensation and strength throughout, with normal coordination but deferred gait assessment.

The patient's medical problems include small bowel obstruction, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, history of CVA, and dementia. The patient is currently receiving intravenous antibiotics and sedation for pain control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, further deterioration in kidney function, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and possible infection given the presence of fever and recent use of antibiotics.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information and additional details may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU for treatment of HAP and aspiration pneumonia. She required intubation and tracheostomy due to respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including small bowel obstruction, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has been diagnosed with a partial small bowel obstruction, which is causing abdominal distension and stool output. Diagnostic paracentesis has shown exudative fluid suspicious for SBP or carcinomatosis.

2. Oliguria/anuria: The patient is experiencing low urine output, with only 10-15cc/hr being unresponsive to fluid bolus.

3. Ineffective coping: The patient's family is in conflict with the decision of care, and a social work consult has been done.

4. Pain control: The patient has been receiving several fentanyl IV boluses for pain management, and appears comfortable with only versed at this time.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, ranging from 170-180s when off sedation.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient remains on assisted ventilation due to failure to wean off from the ventilator. She"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted for treatment of HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) and later readmitted due to respiratory distress. She underwent intubation and tracheostomy. The patient's current medical conditions include small bowel obstruction, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and rising creatinine levels. She also has a diagnosis of malignant effusion and adenocarcinoma. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support set at 3-29 and receiving 40% FiO2. She is also on diuretics, antibiotics, and other medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to failure to wean off. There is a concern for possible aspiration pneumonia.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has a partial small bowel obstruction with massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. Stool output continues despite hypoactive bowel sounds.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has low urine output of 10-15cc/hr and is unresponsive to fluid bolus.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is mid-80's with MAP 55-57.
5. Rising Creatinine"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) and aspiration pneumonia, and remains on assisted ventilation. The patient's failure to wean from the ventilator indicates ongoing respiratory distress.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a partial SBO, which is causing abdominal distension and bowel edema. Diagnostic paracentesis has demonstrated exudative fluid suspicious for SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), carcinomatosis, etc.

3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has low urine output (10-15cc/hr) and is unresponsive to fluid bolus. This may indicate kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the mid-80s with a MAP of 55-57, indicating hypotension.

5. Fever/UTI: The patient had a temperature spike of 100.7 on [5-24] and was started on vancomycin and meropenem due to suspected infection. Blood and urine cultures were sent.

6. Cardiac Failure: The patient's echo shows new regional wall abnormality and worsened MR (mitral regurgitation). Troponin and CK levels are negative, suggesting an acute cardiac event during respiratory distress.

   respiratory distress, intubated, now s/p tracheostomy on [**2171-5-22**].
   # Respiratory distress: Patient with hx of HAP PNA, large effusion and
   diastolic CHF.  Most recent episode requiring intubation most likely
   related to aspiration. s/p levo ([**Date range (1) 7193**]), Vanc/Zosyn discontinued
   due to rash (rec

   [**5-22**].  Remains afebrile.  Stable respiratory status on PS [**3-29**] with FiO2
   of 40%.  CXR remains does not show significant improvement.  Pt major
   problems now are low tidal volumes due to muscular weakness and
   increased chest wall compliance from ascitic fluid/ volume overload.
   Patient sucessfully diuresing with lasix and acetazolamide
   - SBT this am with trach mask if patient can be successfully weaned off
   ventilator
   - continue PO ativan as needed for sedation, no fentanyl/versed
   - suction for secretions
   - continue mdi
s prn wheezing
   - monitor for any decompensation in the setting of possible aspiration
   3 days ago, no indication for antibiotics now
   - continue to diurese with lasix gtt as tolerated (monitor via
   hemodynamics- BP and pulse)
   - monitor respiratory status with serial VBGs to ensure adequate
   ventilation in setting of low tidal volumes
   - cont acetazolamide today to counteract metabolic alkalosis from lasix
   # Rising creatinine: 1.1 up from baseline of 0.8 in setting of
   aggressive diuresis.  While patient
s blood pressure has remained
   normal, patient has significant athrosclerosis and may require higher
   BP for adequate renal perfusion
   - likely represents prerenal ARF
   - continue lasix gtt at 2mg/hr
   - trend serial creatinine: if continues to rise must consider diagnosis
   of ATN and send full w/u with UA and lytes
   #  SBO: partial SBO in setting of massive bowel edema and increased
   ascitic fluid.  Diagnostic paracentesis demonstrates malignant
   effusion.  Clinical improvement with improved bowel sounds and
   decreasing abdominal distension
   - restart tube feeds at 10 mL/hr, check for residuals
   -f/u on paracentesis results
   - continue dexamethasone
   -replace electrolytes as needed, keep potassium > 4.0 esp in setting of
   metabolic alkalosis
   -continue bowel regimen, hold peristaltics
   # Fever/UTI
 s/p full course of antibiotics with Bactrim.  Pt is
   stable
   # Cardiac Failure: ECHO this admission demonstrates new regional wall
   abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST
   elevation. Most likely suffered acute event during respiratory
   distress.
   - daily ASA

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA who was being treated for HAP vs. aspiration PNA with right-sided effusion. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. The patient has been admitted and discharged from the hospital multiple times for various conditions.

Current Assessment and Plan:

1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a partial SBO due to massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. A diagnostic paracentesis showed malignant effusion. Clinical improvement is seen with improved bowel sounds and decreasing abdominal distension.

2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has low urine output (10-15cc/hr) and is unresponsive to fluid bolus.

3. Ineffective coping: There is conflict among family members regarding the decision of care, and a social work consult has been done.

4. Pain control: The patient has been receiving fentanyl IV bolus (50 mcg) q2hrs for pain and appears comfortable with only versed at this time.

5. Hypertension, benign: The patient's blood pressure is in the 170-180 range when off sedation.

6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient remains on AC and is unable to be weaned off the ventilator. She has been tracheostomized and started on vancomycin and meropenem for possible aspiration pneumonia"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of dementia, stroke, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and respiratory distress. The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia. She underwent tracheostomy on [**2171-5-22**] and remains on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 123/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 717 mL and a total output of 1950 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1233 mL. The patient's urine output has been low, ranging from 10-15 cc/hr, and unresponsive to fluid bolus.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.0-11.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 25.9-26.8 g/dL, platelet count of 993-19 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 0.8-1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 80-116 mg/dL, and sodium/potassium levels within normal ranges.

The patient's medical problems include small bowel obstruction, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, hypotension, and fever of unknown origin.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, small bowel obstruction with malignant effusion, rising creatinine, and cardiac failure with new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation.

The patient's goals of care include do not resuscitate (DNR) status, with no escalation of care with central line or pressors. A family meeting will be held to discuss options of palliative care in the setting of newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   [**5-22**].  Remains afebrile.  Stable respiratory status on trach mask.  CXR
   remains does not show significant improvement.  Pt major problems now
   are low tidal volumes due to muscular weakness and increased chest wall
   compliance from ascitic fluid/ volume overload.  Patient sucessfully
   diuresing with lasix and acetazolamide.
   - lasix gtt titrated down as UOP has been adequate and pressures are
   low, will continue to monitor and adjust gtt as needed
   - continue trach mask

   - monitor respiratory status with serial VBGs to ensure adequate
   ventilation in setting of low tidal volumes
   - will dc acetazolamide today given alkalosis, consider adding back if
   pt continues to have pbs while on lasix
   - follow lytes closely while on lasix
   # Rising creatinine: 1.1 up from baseline of 0.8 in setting of
   aggressive diuresis.  While patient
s blood pressure has remained
   normal, patient has significant athrosclerosis and may require higher
   BP for adequate renal perfusion
   - likely represents prerenal ARF
   - continue lasix gtt at 1g/hr
   - trend serial creatinine: if continues to rise must consider diagnosis
   of ATN and send full w/u with UA and lytes
   #  SBO: partial SBO in setting of massive bowel edema and increased
   ascitic fluid.  Diagnostic paracentesis demonstrates malignant
   effusion.  Clinical improvement with improved bowel sounds and
   decreasing abdominal distension, pt continues to stool.
   - advance tube feeds
   - f/u on paracentesis results
   - continue dexamethasone
   - replace electrolytes as needed, keep potassium > 4.0 esp in setting
   of metabolic alkalosis
   - continue bowel regimen, hold peristaltics
   # Fever/UTI
 s/p full course of antibiotics with Bactrim.  Pt is
   stable
   -will check blood, urine, sputum cxs
   # Cardiac Failure: ECHO this admission demonstrates new regional wall
   abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST
   elevation. Most likely suffered acute event during respiratory
   distress.
   - daily ASA
   - monitor UOP and fluid balance.

- She has been experiencing low tidal volumes due to muscular weakness and increased chest wall compliance from ascitic fluid and volume overload.
- The patient has been successfully diuresing with Lasix and acetazolamide.
- Her respiratory status remains stable on a tracheostomy mask, and she is being monitored with serial VBGs (Venous Blood Gases) to ensure adequate ventilation.
- The patient has a rising creatinine level, which is likely prerenal acute renal failure (ARF) due to aggressive diuresis.
- She has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and osteoporosis.
- The patient has a partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. A diagnostic paracentesis showed malignant effusion.
- Her bowel sounds are improving, and she is currently tolerating tube feeds.
- The patient has been treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Bactrim and is stable.
- She has a new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident's note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize
   and add the following points:
   [**Age over 90 **]F large CVA, resp failure s/p T+G ongoing ileus with emesis and GJ
   tube leak. Off sedation, CT with partial SBO, small L ovarian mass -
   cytology +adenoca. Met with family yesterday to discuss new dx of
   intraabdominal malignancy. Thrombocytosis - new.
   Agree with plan to manage partial SBO with dex for
   malignancy-associated SBO/ileus
 seems to be improving with bowel
   sounds present today. Will attempt to increase TFs today. For resp
   failure, monitor off sedation and c/w TM trials while continuing lasix
   drip. Can follow ABG/VBG. Will d/c diamox for metabolic alkalosis
   received 3 days.
   Will continue to discuss goals of care with family, pt DNR, no
   escalation of care. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   unchanged.  Patient sucessfully diuresing with lasix and acetazolamide.
   Pt weaned off vent on [**6-1**] after concerns of low tidal volume/muscle
   weakness resolved.
   - continue lasix gtt titrated to UOP of 50 cc/h, check elctorlyted [**Hospital1 **],
   repleat as needed
   - continue trach mask, wean oxygen as tolerated with Sats>92%
   - continue PO ativan as needed for sedation, no fentanyl/versed
   - suction for secretions
   - continue mdi
s prn wheezing
   - monitor respiratory status with serial VBGs to ensure adequate
   ventilation in setting of low tidal volumes
   - consider acetazolamide if pt continues to have pbs while on lasix
   # Rising creatinine: Resolved, creatinine returned to baseline at 0.7
   from 1.1, originally due to aggressive diuresis.  Patient has
   significant athrosclerosis and may require higher BP for adequate renal
   perfusion, therefore will avoid intravascular depletion.
   - continue lasix gtt at UOP goal of 50cc/h
   - trend serial creatinine: if rises again, consider diagnosis of ATN
   and send full w/u with UA and lytes
   #  SBO: partial SBO in setting of massive bowel edema and increased
   ascitic fluid.  Diagnostic paracentesis demonstrates malignant
   effusion.  Clinical improvement with improved bowel sounds and
   decreasing abdominal distension, pt continues to stool.
   - advance tube feeds
   - continue dexamethasone
   - replace electrolytes as needed, keep potassium > 4.0 esp in setting
   of metabolic alkalosis
   - continue bowel regimen, hold peristaltics
   # Fever/UTI
 s/p full course of antibiotics with Bactrim.  Pt is
   stable, however with thrombocytosis, possible reactive.
   -f/u blood, urine, sputum cx from [**6-1**]
   # Cardiac Failure: ECHO this admission demonstrates new regional wall
   abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST
   elevation. Most likely suffered acute event during respiratory
   distress.
   - daily ASA
   - monitor UOP and fluid balance.
   # Anemia
 Stable. Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - monitor hct
   - will hold T&S now as pt has been stable
   #Maculopapular rash: resolved, likely drug rxn with fungal infection in
   intertriginous zones.  Zosyn d/c
   - continue antifungal cream PRN

   [**5-22**].  Remains afebrile.  Stable respiratory status on trach mask.  CXR
   remains does not show significant improvement.  Pt major problems now
   are low tidal volumes due to muscular weakness and increased chest wall
   compliance from ascitic fluid/ volume overload.  Patient sucessfully
   diuresing with lasix and acetazolamide.
   - lasix gtt titrated down as UOP has been adequate and pressures are

   ventilation in setting of low tidal volumes
   - will dc acetazolamide today given alkalosis, consider adding back if
   pt continues to have pbs while on lasix
   - follow lytes closely while on lasix
   # Rising creatinine: 1.1 up from baseline of 0.8 in setting of
   aggressive diuresis.  While patient
s blood pressure has remained
   normal, patient has significant athrosclerosis and may require higher
   BP for adequate renal perfusion
   - likely represents prerenal ARF

   of ATN and send full w/u with UA and lytes
   #  SBO: partial SBO in setting of massive bowel edema and increased
   ascitic fluid.  Diagnostic paracentesis demonstrates malignant
   effusion.  Clinical improvement with improved bowel sounds and
   decreasing abdominal distension, pt continues to stool.
   - advance tube feeds
   - f/u on paracentesis results
   - continue dexamethasone
   - replace electrolytes as needed, keep potassium > 4.0 esp in setting
   of metabolic alkalosis
   - continue bowel regimen, hold peristaltics
   # Fever/UTI
 s/p full course of antibiotics with Bactrim.  Pt is

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 91-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient developed respiratory failure and required intubation, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation. She also had a right-sided pleural effusion and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current condition includes small bowel obstruction (SBO), oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, acute and chronic pain, hypertension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's medical history includes a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and dementia.

The patient's recent treatment includes the administration of lasix, acetazolamide, ativan, and suctioning for secretions. The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate a possible prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI), and her SBO is causing partial bowel obstruction due to massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. Diagnostic paracentesis shows malignant effusion. The patient's cardiac failure is likely related to an acute event during respiratory distress.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of HAP versus aspiration pneumonia and developed respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient had a tracheostomy on 5/22 and was successfully weaned off the ventilator on 6/1 after concerns of low tidal volume/muscle weakness resolved.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a partial SBO in the setting of massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. Diagnostic paracentesis demonstrated a malignant effusion. Clinical improvement has been seen with improved bowel sounds and decreasing abdominal distension, and the patient is continuing to stool.
   - Advance tube feeds
   - Contact palliative care re: duration of dexamethasone treatment
   - Replace electrolytes as needed, keep potassium > 4.0 especially in the setting of metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue bowel regimen, hold peristaltics

2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has been experiencing decreased urine output.
   - Continue lasix gtt titrated to UOP of 50 cc/h, check electrolytes at [Hospital1], replete as needed, goal: -1L next 24 hours

3. Hypertension, benign: The patient's blood pressure is elevated.

","The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis who was being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia with a right-sided effusion. She developed respiratory failure and hypercarbia requiring intubation. She was previously admitted and discharged from the hospital unit on 5/7 for treatment of HAP, readmitted with respiratory distress, intubated, and now has a tracheostomy since 5/22, off vent since 7/11.

The patient's current condition includes small bowel obstruction (SBO), oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and other medical conditions such as CVA, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8Â°C (96.5Â°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 117/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheostomy mask, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10. The patient is awake but non-responsive.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels initially but returned to baseline at 0.7 mg/dL, and normal liver function tests. The urinalysis shows no signs of infection. The sputum gram stain reveals 4+ gram-negative rods, 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs/clusters, and 1+ budding yeast.

The patient's recent interventions include advanced tube feeds, blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine culture. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of SBO, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and other medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening renal function, worsening malnutrition, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly individual with a history of dementia, chronic hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in residual left-sided paralysis. The patient was admitted with aspiration pneumonia and sepsis, and a tracheostomy was performed. The patient's condition has been complicated by small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception and adhesions, oliguria/anuria, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin (FUO), and an ovarian mass detected on CT scan. The patient also has chronic liver disease, as indicated by the presence of ascites and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's SBO may lead to complications such as persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and distension. There is also a risk of bowel ischemia or necrosis if the obstruction persists.

2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's low urine output may indicate renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury. This can be caused by hypovolemia, urinary tract obstruction, or intrinsic kidney damage. If left untreated, it can progress to acute renal failure.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels suggest respiratory failure. This can be due to several factors including pneumonia, SBO, or underlying chronic respiratory disease. If not adequately managed, it can lead to tissue hypoxia and multiorgan dysfunction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke), dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress, likely secondary to aspiration, and subsequently underwent a tracheostomy on 5/22. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory: The patient remains stable on a tracheostomy with a tracheostomy mask, weaned off the ventilator on 6/1 after concerns of low tidal volume/muscle weakness resolved. She is being diuresed with lasix and has shown improvement on chest X-ray.
2. Gastrointestinal: The patient has small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. A diagnostic paracentesis revealed malignant effusion, possibly ovarian cancer. The patient's bowel sounds are improving, and there is a decrease in abdominal distension. She is currently stooling well.
3. Infection: The patient completed a full course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is currently stable. She has tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and has a white blood cell count of 12.
4. Renal: The patient's rising creatinine levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of HAP vs. aspiration PNA and developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She underwent a tracheostomy on 05/22 and was weaned off the ventilator on 06/01. The patient has been stable with no fever and her respiratory status is stable on a tracheostomy mask. Her chest X-ray is unchanged. She is successfully diuresing with Lasix and acetazolamide was stopped. The patient's recent history includes readmission with respiratory distress, intubation, and tracheostomy placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory distress indicates a high risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has partial SBO with bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. Regular monitoring of bowel sounds and abdominal distension is recommended. Stooling past 24 hours indicates clinical improvement.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output needs to be closely monitored as oliguria/anuria may occur due to decreased renal perfusion or medication effects.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure should be regularly monitored, as hypotension can lead to inadequate organ perfusion.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of small bowel obstruction, including intussusception and adhesions. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36Â°C, heart rate between 73-120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/64 to 170/180 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,134 mL of total fluids, including 613 mL of oral intake, 171 mL of intravenous fluids, and 280 mL of drainage output. The total output is 1,610 mL, consisting of 1,330 mL of urine output, 560 mL of NG tube output, and 280 mL of stool output. The overall fluid balance is negative by 476 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 8.0 to 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 25.6% and 26.9 g/dL, platelet count between 919 and 971 K/uL, creatinine levels between 1.0 and 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 80 and 118 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include small bowel obstruction, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, history of CVA, and dementia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of the patient's respiratory function, worsening of the small bowel obstruction leading to bowel ischemia or necrosis, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential infections due to the use of indwelling lines and tubes.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, bowel movements, skin integrity, and fluid balance to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   respiratory distress, intubated, now s/p tracheostomy on [**2171-5-22**], off
   vent 7/11.
   # Respiratory distress: Patient with hx of HAP PNA, large effusion and
   diastolic CHF.  Most recent episode requiring intubation most likely
   related to aspiration. s/p levo ([**Date range (1) 7193**]), Vanc/Zosyn discontinued
   due to rash (rec
d 7 of 8 doses).  Blood cxs negative.  Tracheostomy
   [**5-22**].  Remains afebrile.  Stable respiratory status on trach mask.  CXR
   unchanged.  Patient sucessfully diuresing with lasix , acetazolamide
   stopped. Pt weaned off vent on [**6-1**] after concerns of low tidal
   volume/muscle weakness resolved.
   - continue lasix gtt titrated to UOP of 50 cc/h, check elctorlyted [**Hospital1 **],
   replete as needed, GOAL: -1L next 24 hours
   - continue trach mask, wean oxygen as tolerated with Sats>92%
   - continue PO ativan as needed for sedation, no fentanyl/versed
   - suction for secretions
   - continue mdi
s prn wheezing
   - monitor respiratory status, will use VBG
s prn to evaluate at this
   time.
   - consider restarting acetazolamide if appropriate
   # Rising creatinine: Resolved, creatinine returned to baseline at 0.7
   from 1.1, originally due to aggressive diuresis.  Patient has
   significant athrosclerosis and may require higher BP for adequate renal
   perfusion, therefore will avoid intravascular depletion.
   - continue lasix gtt at UOP goal of 50cc/h
   - trend serial creatinine: if rises again, consider diagnosis of ATN
   and send full w/u with UA and lytes
   #  SBO: partial SBO in setting of massive bowel edema and increased
   ascitic fluid.  Diagnostic paracentesis demonstrates malignant
   effusion.  Clinical improvement with improved bowel sounds and
   decreasing abdominal distension, pt continues to stool. Stooling past
   24 hours.
   - advance tube feeds
   - contact palliative care re: duration of dexamethasone treatment (4mg
   q8 currently)
   - replace electrolytes as needed, keep potassium > 4.0 esp in setting
   of metabolic alkalosis
   - continue bowel regimen, hold peristaltics
   # Possible Infection
 s/p full course of antibiotics with Bactrim for
   UTI.  Pt is stable, however now pt with reactive thrombocytosis,
   remains afebrile. Stooling.  C diff neg [**6-2**]. WBC up to 12 on [**6-2**]. no

   # Cardiac Failure: ECHO this admission demonstrates new regional wall
   abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST
   elevation. Most likely suffered acute event during respiratory
   distress.
   - daily ASA
   - monitor UOP and fluid balance.
   # Anemia
 Stable. Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - monitor hct
   - will hold T&S now as pt has been stable
   #Maculopapular rash: resolved, likely drug rxn with fungal infection in
   intertriginous zones.  Zosyn d/c
   - continue antifungal cream PRN

   # Respiratory distress: Patient with hx of HAP PNA, large effusion and
   diastolic CHF.  Most recent episode requiring intubation most likely
   related to aspiration. s/p levo ([**Date range (1) 7193**]), Vanc/Zosyn discontinued
   due to rash (rec

   [**5-22**].  Remains afebrile.  Stable respiratory status on trach mask.  CXR
   unchanged.  Patient sucessfully diuresing with lasix , acetazolamide
   stopped. Pt weaned off vent on [**6-1**] after concerns of low tidal
   volume/muscle weakness resolved. CXR improved today after lasix.
   - continue lasix gtt titrated to UOP of 50 cc/h, check elctorlyted [**Hospital1 **],
   replete as needed, GOAL: -1L next 24 hours
   - continue trach mask, wean oxygen as tolerated with Sats>92%
   - continue PO ativan as needed for sedation, no fentanyl/versed
   - suction for secretions
   - continue mdi
s prn wheezing
   - monitor respiratory status, will use VBG
s prn to evaluate at this
   time.
   - consider restarting acetazolamide if appropriate
   # Rising creatinine: Resolved, creatinine returned to baseline at 0.7
   from 1.1, originally due to aggressive diuresis.  Patient has
   significant athrosclerosis and may require higher BP for adequate renal
   perfusion, therefore will avoid intravascular depletion.
   - continue lasix gtt at UOP goal of 50cc/h
   - trend serial creatinine: if rises again, consider diagnosis of ATN
   and send full w/u with UA and lytes
   #  SBO: partial SBO in setting of massive bowel edema and increased
   ascitic fluid.  Diagnostic paracentesis demonstrates malignant
   effusion.  Clinical improvement with improved bowel sounds and
   decreasing abdominal distension, pt continues to stool. Stooling past
   24 hours.
   - advance tube feeds
   - contact palliative care re: duration of dexamethasone treatment (4mg
   q8 currently)
   - replace electrolytes as needed, keep potassium > 4.0 esp in setting
   of metabolic alkalosis
   - continue bowel regimen, hold peristaltics
   # Possible Infection
 s/p full course of antibiotics with Bactrim for
   UTI.  Pt is stable, however now pt with reactive thrombocytosis,
   remains afebrile. Stooling.  C diff neg [**6-2**]. WBC up to 12 on [**6-2**]

   # Cardiac Failure: ECHO this admission demonstrates new regional wall
   abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative. EKG no ST
   elevation. Most likely suffered acute event during respiratory
   distress.
   - daily ASA
   - monitor UOP and fluid balance.
   # Anemia
 Stable. Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - monitor hct
   - will hold T&S now as pt has been stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, and RA who was admitted for treatment of HAP and aspiration pneumonia. She developed respiratory failure and required intubation, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of hypertension, benign, and has been treated for various conditions including SBO, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, altered nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and cardiac failure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, rising creatinine levels, partial SBO with malignant effusion, possible infection, and cardiac failure with a new regional wall abnormality and worsened MR. The patient has anemia of chronic disease, maculopapular rash (resolved), rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and goals of care including DNR and consideration for palliative care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonia, and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Failure: The presence of a new regional wall abnormality and worsened MR on the ECHO suggests possible cardiac failure.
3. Infection: Despite being treated with antibiotics, the patient's elevated WBC count and presence of coag+ staph and gram neg rods in sputum indicate a potential ongoing infection.
4. Small Bowel Obstruction: The partial SBO and malignant"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of stroke, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and has since been intubated, tracheostomized, and weaned off the ventilator.

The patient's medical issues include small bowel obstruction, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin.

The patient's vital signs are generally stable with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/64 to 135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Kidney function is mildly impaired with a creatinine level of 1.1. Liver enzymes and electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing lasix at a titrated dose to achieve a urine output of 50 cc/hour, weaning off the tracheostomy mask while maintaining oxygen saturation above 92%, and providing sedation as needed. The patient's goals of care include do not resuscitate (DNR) status and consideration for palliative care due"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical progress note indicates multiple potential medical complications. These include:

1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has been diagnosed with a partial SBO, which is causing symptoms such as abdominal distension and decreased bowel sounds. This can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory distress and has required intubation multiple times. They are currently on a tracheostomy and are being weaned off the ventilator. It is essential to monitor their respiratory status closely.

3. Hypotension and Fluid Balance: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, and efforts are being made to optimize fluid balance through diuresis. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid administration is necessary.

4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output has been low, which may indicate renal impairment. Frequent assessment of urine output and electrolyte levels is required.

5. Fever and Possible Infection: Despite being afebrile at the moment, the patient has shown signs of infection in the past. It is crucial to monitor their temperature regularly and follow up with appropriate investigations if necessary.

6. Rising Creatinine: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated initially but have now returned to baseline. This could be related to aggressive diuresis, but further monitoring is necessary to ensure renal function remains stable.

","Based on the provided information, the patient has several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has been diagnosed with a partial SBO, which is causing abdominal distension and difficulty in passing stool. This could be due to bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory distress and required intubation. They were weaned off the ventilator on [**6-1**] but still remain on a tracheostomy mask with supplemental oxygen.

3. Hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, although it is mentioned as benign.

4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has a low urine output, which may be related to their renal function or other underlying conditions.

5. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite being afebrile, the patient has had episodes of fever in the past that could not be attributed to a specific source.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has developed a maculopapular rash that was likely due to a drug reaction. There is also mention of desquamation on the thighs, trunk, and neck.

7. Hypercarbia: The patient initially had hypercarbia requiring intubation.

8. Potential Infection: The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) for which they received antibiotics. They also have an elevated white blood cell count and positive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia), large pleural effusion, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She has been admitted multiple times, including a recent readmission for respiratory distress and intubation. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and has been weaned off the ventilator. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask and is stable with improved respiratory status. The patient is also experiencing small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed malignant effusion, likely ovarian cancer. The patient has shown clinical improvement with improved bowel sounds and decreasing abdominal distension, and she is continuing to stool.

The patient has a history of CVA (stroke), dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and recently diagnosed adenocarcinoma. She has been treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia, and she has undergone full courses of antibiotics. The patient's WBC count continues to rise, which may be due to dexamethasone treatment. Her stool culture was negative for C. difficile. The patient's creatinine level has returned to baseline after aggressive diuresis, and her cardiac failure is being managed with daily ASA and monitoring of urine output and fluid balance.

The patient's goals of care include do not resuscitate (DNR) status, with no escalation of care using central lines or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old female with a history of HAP, pneumonia, CVA, dementia, RA, and recent admission and discharge from another hospital unit. The patient presented with respiratory distress, intubation, tracheostomy, and weaning off the ventilator. She also has a history of hypertensive urgency, small bowel obstruction (SBO), oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control, hypertension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, hypotension, and altered mental status.

Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a partial SBO with massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. A diagnostic paracentesis revealed malignant effusion, likely ovarian cancer. The patient is showing clinical improvement with improved bowel sounds and decreasing abdominal distension.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress, which was likely caused by aspiration pneumonia. She has been successfully weaned off the ventilator and is currently on tracheostomy with oxygen saturation above 95%.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from mid-80s to 170-180s. She has been treated with lasix for fluid management.
4. Ineffective coping: The patient's family is experiencing conflict regarding the decision of care, and social work consult has been done.

","Summary:
The patient is a female with a history of CVA, dementia, RA, and HAP/PNA. She was admitted for treatment of HAP and developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She had a tracheostomy on 05/22. The patient also has small bowel obstruction (SBO), malignant pleural effusion, and is currently NPO. She has been receiving various medications, including lasix, heparin, fentanyl, and protonix. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a low urine output and is experiencing some respiratory distress. She has a maculopapular rash, which resolved, and is being treated for possible fungal infection. The patient's family is in conflict with the decision of care, and social work consult has been done. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of HAP/PNA and is currently on a tracheostomy, indicating previous episodes of respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has a low urine output, which can be concerning for renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
4. Ineffective Coping: The family conflict with the decision of care may result in ineffective coping"

","Based on the provided information, the patient has multiple medical complications and conditions. Some of the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator. There is also mention of an ongoing respiratory distress and the need for tracheostomy.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has a partial small bowel obstruction, which is causing abdominal distension and decreased bowel sounds. There is also a concern for malignant effusion, possibly due to ovarian cancer.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, requiring the use of diuretics and vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient has low oxygen levels in the blood, requiring supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy.

5. Ineffective Coping: The patient's family is experiencing conflict regarding the decisions made for the patient's care, leading to the need for a social work consult.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has skin sloughing and a maculopapular rash, which resolved but was initially suspected to be a drug reaction.

7. Rising Creatinine: The patient had an elevated creatinine level initially, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. It has since returned to baseline.

8. Cardiac Failure: The patient's echocardiogram shows new regional wall abnormality and worsened mitral regurgitation,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of stroke, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, and recent hospitalizations for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress due to aspiration, and subsequently developed small bowel obstruction, oliguria/anuria, ineffective coping, pain control issues, hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and other comorbidities.

The patient underwent tracheostomy on 5/22, was successfully weaned off the ventilator on 6/1, and is currently on comfort measures only (CMO). She has been discharged from unnecessary medications and is only on morphine for dyspnea/pain, ativan for anxiety, and albuterol nebs as needed for comfort.

The patient's recent medical issues include a partial small bowel obstruction with massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid, malignant effusion likely due to ovarian cancer, reactive thrombocytosis, negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test, coag-positive Staphylococcus in sputum, yeast colonization in urine, no current antibiotics, stable creatinine levels, worsening mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram, and anemia of chronic disease.

The patient's skin integrity is compromised, and she has developed a maculopapular rash that resolved and was"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia), aspiration PNA (pneumonia), and respiratory distress requiring intubation. There is also mention of acute respiratory failure not associated with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient's current vital signs show a decreased SpO2 level of 85%, indicating possible hypoxemia. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial.

2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a partial SBO in the setting of massive bowel edema and increased ascitic fluid. A diagnostic paracentesis reveals malignant effusion, likely ovarian cancer. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), and there are concerns about coffee ground vs feculent emesis from gastric suction. Monitoring for signs of bowel ischemia or perforation is essential.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has desquamation of the thighs, trunk, and neck, which may indicate impaired skin integrity. This could lead to increased risk of infection and pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessment and appropriate care are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Oliguria/anuria: The patient has been experiencing oliguria (reduced urine output) or anuria (no urine output). This could be due to renal dysfunction or poor cardiac output. Close monitoring of fluid balance"
