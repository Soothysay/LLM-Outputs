   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11989**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
   depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] with
   hypotension and trop leak, found to have apical ballooning on TTE
   suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   Good response to lasix IV
   - continue to diurese with lasix IV
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Will hold off starting lovenox for now as she has
   had a Hct drop since admission of almost 10.  If her Hct remains
   stable, can consider starting lovenox/Coumadin in a day or two.
   - if pressure tolerates, start captopril 6.25 tid this afternoon.
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an outpatient to reassess her cardiac
   function.
   - discontinue a-line.
   #Anemia: may be hemodilutional, but in setting of heparin a GI source
   needs to be considered.  Patient has no lower back pain that would be
   evidence of RP bleed
   -guaiac stools.
   -[**Hospital1 **] hct
   -continue IV PPi
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.
   - Pain control with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn and Tylenol prn.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   # Mitral regurgitation:  The patient has known mitral regurgitation and
   is followed as an outpatient for this with yearly echos.  Due to the
   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.  With her TTE
   and cath results, there is another more likely cause for her
   hypotension and she currently has no abdominal pain.
   - Will DC antibiotics and monitor clinically.
   - If she spikes a fever, or becomes clinically unstable, can restart
   them.
   - Trend her WBC (somewhat elevated still)
   - F/u BCx.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Resolved.
   # Depression:
   - Continue home buproprion and ativan prn.

   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   The patient
s cardiac cath revealed a lowish cardiac index and apical
   hypo/akinesis concerning for Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy.  She was also
   found to have a possible posterior leaflet flail with moderate to
   severe MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] clinical history is also congruent with Takotsubo
s as
   she experienced her chest pain when in a very stressful situation
   involving her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] presentation is also consistent with
   Takotsubo
s as her troponins were elevated at initial presentation.
   She was weaned off levophed prior to arrival to the CCU.
   -  Will treat her acute systolic heart failure with diuresis.  She
   initially received 40 mg IV lasix on arrival to the CCU.  Her SBPs
   remained stable and she had good urine output to this dose.  Will
   continue to use 40 mg IV lasix prn with a goal negative 1-1.5 L/day.
   -  If she becomes hypotensive, will use milrinone for pressure support
   while diuresing and consider changing the lasix to a lasix drip.
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Will hold off starting lovenox for now as she has
   had a Hct drop since admission of almost 10.  If her Hct remains
   stable, can consider starting lovenox/Coumadin in a day or two.
   - Will hold off restarting her home acei given her recent hypotension.
   It can restarted if her pressures remain stable with diuresis.
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an outpatient to reassess her cardiac
   function.

   Ms [**Known lastname 11989**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
   depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] with
   hypotension and trop leak, found to have apical ballooning on TTE
   suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   Good response to lasix IV
   - continue to diurese with lasix IV
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Will hold off starting lovenox for now as she has
   had a Hct drop since admission of almost 10.  If her Hct remains
   stable, can consider starting lovenox/Coumadin in a day or two.
   - if pressure tolerates, start captopril 6.25 tid this afternoon.
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an outpatient to reassess her cardiac
   function.
   - discontinue a-line.
   #Anemia: may be hemodilutional, but in setting of heparin a GI source
   needs to be considered.  Patient has no lower back pain that would be
   evidence of RP bleed
   -guaiac stools.
   -[**Hospital1 **] hct
   -continue IV PPi
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.
   - Pain control with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn and Tylenol prn.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   # Mitral regurgitation:  The patient has known mitral regurgitation and
   is followed as an outpatient for this with yearly echos.  Due to the
   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.  With her TTE
   and cath results, there is another more likely cause for her
   hypotension and she currently has no abdominal pain.
   - Will DC antibiotics and monitor clinically.
   - If she spikes a fever, or becomes clinically unstable, can restart
   them.
   - Trend her WBC (somewhat elevated still)
   - F/u BCx.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Resolved.
   # Depression:
   - Continue home buproprion and ativan prn.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] with hypotension and troponin leak, which indicated acute systolic heart failure and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 112/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 4L nasal cannula. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including IV Lasix for diuresis, heparin for thrombus prevention, and pain control with oxycodone and Tylenol. The patient is also taking ASA, simvastatin, and IV pantoprazole.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.0 K/uL and a hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 26.5%. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: The patient's hypotension is related to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient should continue to be monitored closely"

   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.
   - F/u BCx.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Resolved.
   # Depression:

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) on [1-11] with hypotension and troponin leak, indicating possible acute systolic heart failure and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been responding well to diuretics, and her cardiac function is being monitored closely. The patient's anemia may be hemodilutional, but further investigation is needed to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding due to heparin therapy. She is also experiencing abdominal pain and has not had a bowel movement since admission. Pain control and management of mitral regurgitation are ongoing concerns. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, and her gallbladder wall thickening is being monitored for potential infection. She is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo cardiomyopathy:
   - Continued hypotension may lead to organ perfusion issues and shock.
   - Apical ballooning in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can result in reduced left ventricular function and subsequent heart failure.
   - Poor response to diuretics could indicate worsening cardiac function or fluid overload.

2. Anemia:
   - Persistent anemia may lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to"
