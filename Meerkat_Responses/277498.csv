   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a cesarean section and hysterectomy due to placenta accreta/percreta. She experienced significant blood loss during the procedure and required a large volume of blood transfusion. 

The patient's current condition indicates that she is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 141 beats per minute and hypotension with a blood pressure of 95/55 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits at 15 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is at 98% on the ventilator. 

Laboratory results reveal thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 116,000/mm3, an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27.6 mg/dL, and a slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management. These include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure during surgery. She will be maintained on assisted controlled ventilation overnight, with potential return to the operating room on Monday for pack removal.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 28.6 seconds and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta accreta/percreta. She experienced significant blood loss during the procedure and is currently in the ICU. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including insulin, fentanyl, and midazolam. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to the broad-spectrum antibiotics and invasive lines and devices, there is a risk of infection. Regular assessment and monitoring of vital signs, cultures, and laboratory results are important to identify any signs of infection early on.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring as she is on invasive ventilation. Adjustments in ventilator settings may be necessary based on her response.

3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate need close monitoring due to the ongoing fluid resuscitation and potential hypovolemia. Frequent assessment of her hemodynamic parameters is crucial.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and low fibrinogen levels, indicating a coagulopathy. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate correction with blood products are necessary.

5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests possible acute kidney injury. Regular monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential.

6. Delirium or Neuro"

   Assessment and Plan
   26 yr old woman with placeneta oercreta s/p c section hysterectomy
   complaicated by massive blood loss
   1. Massive Blood Loss 2ndry to C hys and percreta:
          PRBC: coming out of OR HCT 21 - goal is 21 or above, checking
   stat repeat
          Plts: only 68 - give a 6 pack now, trend goal above 100 while
   bleeding
          INR: s/p 1.6,
          Fibrinogen 112- only got 1 unit cryo, repeat  and another unit
   for fibringoen less than 100
          iCa very low, check q2 and replete now
          Follow HCT q2, q4 hr cbc/coags
   If HCT dropping or hemodynamically unstable, need stat calls to OB gyn
   and also IR for possible angio to see if there is an artey to embolize
   (though uterine a's are out and would likely be bladder or  vagina so
   would not be amenable to embolization
   Pt has packed abdomen and fascia is closed so would be at risk for
   abdominal compartment syndrome, check baseline bladder pressure, but
   PIPS ok so doubt at least right now
   Cipro, vanco, Flagyl for empric ABX while ABD is packed  - ID
   ocnsuklted by OB Gyn
   2. Respiratory Failure: oxygenation stable despite massive IVF, check
   CXR for
                                       Asthma: currently stable on vent -
   CMV, PIP 29, Pl23 so low resistance will trend
                                                   :  start MDIs
   3. Diabetes: insulin drip for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive blood loss during the surgery, receiving 15 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 6 units of platelets, 10 fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 cryoprecipitate, and 8.7 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF). Despite this, the patient is still oozing from the cervical stump, and thrombin was used to control bleeding. Lap pads were left in the abdomen, and the fascia was closed.

The patient has been sent to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management. She is at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome due to the closed fascia and packed abdomen. Baseline bladder pressure is being checked, and PIPs (peak inspiratory pressures) are being monitored. Empiric antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and Flagyl has been initiated for potential abdominal infection.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (VT) set at 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2"

   Following Hct q2hrs (transfuse for Hct <25); plts/coags/fibrinogen
   q4hrs (tf for plts <50, fibrinogen <100)
   If HCT dropping precipitously or hemodynamically unstable, need stat
   calls to OB gyn and also IR for possible embolization (though uterine
   a's are out and would likely be bladder or  vagina so would not be
   amenable to embolization).
   Pt has packed abdomen and fascia is closed so would be at risk for
   abdominal compartment syndrome, following PIPs- avoiding bladder
   pressures as [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old woman who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive blood loss, resulting in a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 17.0%. She received 15 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of platelets, 10 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 8.7 liters of intravenous fluids intraoperatively. Despite these efforts, she continues to ooze from the cervical laceration. She was sent to the ICU for close monitoring of her hemodynamic status and respiratory function.

The patient's arterial line was inserted at 06:31 PM, a multi-lumen line at 06:38 PM, and she received invasive ventilation support at 07:00 PM. Blood cultures were taken at 07:30 PM and 10:22 PM, urine culture at 10:18 PM, and sputum culture at 12:07 AM. She received an additional 3 units of packed red blood cells, 1 unit of platelets, and 1 cryoprecipitate overnight.

Her vital signs include a heart rate of 145 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/57 mmHg to 133/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has persistent sinus tachycardia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive blood loss intraoperatively and postoperatively, requiring blood transfusions and ongoing resuscitation efforts. The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation with stable oxygenation but remains hemodynamically unstable. She is at risk for developing abdominal compartment syndrome due to the abdominal packing and has ongoing bleeding from the placental site. Cultures have been obtained for blood, urine, and sputum. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and she is being closely monitored with serial Hct checks and other lab parameters. She is receiving insulin for her IDDM, pain management with fentanyl, and sedation with midazolam. The patient is NPO and will be taken back to the OR on [**6-18**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia
2. Coagulopathy due to massive transfusion and ongoing bleeding
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome
4. Infection (as evidenced by the cultures obtained)
5. Respiratory failure
6. Hyperglycemia due to IDDM and stress response
7. Tachycardia and potential cardiac complications
8. Potential need for an embolization procedure to control bleeding

","The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive blood loss during the operation, requiring transfusion of 15 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of platelets, 10 units of fresh frozen plasma, 1 unit of cryoprecipitate, and 8.7 liters of intravenous fluids. Despite these measures, the patient continues to ooze blood from the surgical site, leading to ongoing blood loss.

The patient is currently in the ICU, where she is being monitored for various complications. She has an arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and urinary catheter in place. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 145 beats per minute and blood pressure of 101/57 mmHg. She is mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 500 mL, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on the ventilator.

Laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 10800/uL, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Coagulation studies reveal a prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 12.5 and a low fibrinogen level of 384 mg/dL. Cultures have been obtained from blood, urine, and sputum, with pending results.

The patient's abdomen is softly distended, and there is minimal serosanguinous drainage noted at the surgical site. No significant edema or clubbing is observed in the extremities, and the skin is warm and without rash or jaundice. Neurological examination reveals that the patient follows simple commands and responds appropriately.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of several potential complications. These include:

1. Acute blood loss: The patient's ongoing blood loss necessitates frequent monitoring of hemoglobin levels and coagulation parameters. Transfusion of blood products will be guided by these results.

2. Infection: Given the invasive procedures and prolonged hospital stay, the patient is at risk for developing infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated empirically, covering common pathogens such as gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.

3. Respiratory failure: Mechanical ventilation is being continued to support the patient's respiratory function. The plan is to take the patient back to the operating room on [**6-18**] for further evaluation and management.

4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), which needs to be managed with insulin infusions.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated, possibly due to volume depletion, pain, or anxiety."

","The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta accreta/percreta with intra-operative hemorrhage. She received a blood transfusion for a low hematocrit level and has been closely monitored in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Her transpulmonary pressures are stable, and she has been producing urine at a rate of 30-50cc/hr. The medical team plans to continue the blood transfusion and schedule her for an operation on Monday unless she becomes unstable.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and has received antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. She is currently receiving insulin, midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl infusions. Other medications include famotidine (Pepcid), dextrose 50%, and albuterol.

Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. The patient's weight has increased from 91 kg at admission to 98.7 kg currently.

Flowsheet data shows a stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 7,135 mL with an output of 1,310 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,825 mL. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta accreta/percreta with intra-operative hemorrhage. The patient has been experiencing ongoing bleeding and requires close monitoring of her hemodynamic status.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 500 mL, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her blood pressure is currently stable at 102/46 mmHg, heart rate is 123 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%. 

The patient has received a total of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hematocrit (Hct) level of 25.6%. She is also receiving an insulin infusion for glycemic control and various medications such as midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and famotidine (Pepcid).

The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hb) level, and normal platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, but her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are slightly elevated. 

The patient's medical history includes asthma and type 1 diabetes mellitus (IDDM), for which she is receiving insulin therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive blood loss during the operation, resulting in ongoing ooze that required lap pads to be left in the abdomen. The patient is currently stable in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Blood Loss: The patient's hemodynamic stability needs to be closely monitored, and she should be transfused with blood products as necessary to maintain a hematocrit level above 25% and platelet count above 50,000/mm3. If there is further significant blood loss or hemodynamic instability, the obstetrician and interventional radiologist should be contacted immediately for potential embolization.

2. Intra-abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's abdomen was packed and the fascia was closed, which puts her at risk for developing abdominal compartment syndrome. Her PIPs (peak inspiratory pressures) should be closely monitored, and bladder pressure should be checked regularly. Measures should be taken to avoid further bladder manipulation due to ongoing bleeding from the densely adherent placenta to the bladder.

3. Infection: The patient is on empiric antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole) while her abdomen is packed. These antibiotics should be continued until the source of infection is controlled and the abdomen is closed.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires continued ventilator"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section/hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive blood loss during the operation, leading to ongoing ooze and the placement of lap pads in the abdomen. Currently, she is hemodynamically stable but remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Blood Loss: The patient is at risk of further blood loss and complications related to her low hematocrit (Hct) levels. Close monitoring of Hct, platelets, coagulation factors, and fibrinogen is necessary. If there is a significant drop in Hct or if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, immediate intervention will be required.

2. Intra-abdominal Compartment Syndrome: Due to the abdominal packing and closure of the fascia, the patient is at risk for developing intra-abdominal compartment syndrome. Regular monitoring of intra-abdominal pressures (IPs) is essential. If elevated IPs are observed, decompression may be necessary.

3. Infection: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole) while the abdomen is packed. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic coverage to prevent infection.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with full support. Oxygenation is stable, but the patient will continue to receive ventilatory support due to recent volume loading and the planned re-expl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive blood loss during the operation and continues to have ongoing bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU for critical care. Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 106/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is intubated and sedated. Her laboratory results show low hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated D-dimer levels, and normal kidney function. Imaging shows no signs of infiltrates or effusions in the lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Blood Loss: The patient's low hemoglobin and platelet count indicate ongoing blood loss. She requires regular monitoring of hemoglobin, platelets, and coagulation parameters. If her hemoglobin drops below 25 or platelets below 50, transfusion will be necessary.

2. Intra-Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (IACS): The patient had lap pads left in the abdomen due to ongoing bleeding, which increases the risk of developing IACS. Close monitoring of intra-abdominal pressures is essential. If there are any signs of compartment syndrome, such as increasing pain or decreased urine output, immediate intervention may be required.

3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive procedures and prolonged hospital stay"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a c-section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive blood loss during the operation and continues to have ongoing bleeding. The patient's current condition is critical, and she is being managed in the ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Acute blood loss: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are low, indicating ongoing blood loss. She requires close monitoring and ongoing blood product replacement to maintain hemodynamic stability.

2. Infection: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics due to the abdominal packing and risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is necessary.

3. Respiratory failure: Despite being on mechanical ventilation, the patient's oxygenation is stable. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters is essential, and adjustments to ventilator settings may be required.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and may require insulin infusions for glycemic control.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to volume depletion and pain. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

6. Sedation: The patient is sedated for comfort and to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of sedation levels and adjustment of medication dosages may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a cesarean section due to placenta percreta and subsequently experienced massive blood loss. She received a significant amount of blood products and intravenous fluids during surgery. Despite this, she continues to ooze from the cervical wound. She has been sent to the ICU for close monitoring and high dependency care. The patient has allergies to penicillins and requires pain management. Her vital signs are stable, but she shows signs of respiratory distress with a low respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume. She has an elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. Her laboratory results indicate low hemoglobin levels and platelet count, as well as abnormalities in electrolyte levels and liver function tests. There is evidence of coagulopathy with elevated D-dimer levels and prolonged PT/INR. The patient's abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants, indicating possible intra-abdominal bleeding. Neurological assessment is limited due to sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's significant blood loss during surgery and ongoing oozing from the cervical wound may lead to hypovolemic shock, characterized by low blood pressure, tachycardia, and signs of poor perfusion.
2. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/INR and elevated D-dimer levels suggest a coagulation disorder. This increases the risk of bleeding complications and may require additional interventions such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a cesarean section and subsequent hysterectomy due to placenta percreta at 35 weeks of gestation. During the operation, the patient experienced massive blood loss, requiring 15 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of platelets, 10 units of fresh frozen plasma, 1 unit of cryoprecipitate, and 8.7 liters of intravenous fluids. Despite receiving these transfusions, the patient continued to ooze from the cervical wound, and thrombin was applied along with additional lap pads placed in the abdomen. The patient's abdomen was closed in layers, and she was sent to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and experienced anaphylaxis in the past. She received vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole as prophylactic antibiotics. The patient is currently on midazolam (versed) infusion, famotidine (pepcid), fentanyl, and insulin gtt.

On physical examination, the patient appears not well nourished and is not in acute distress. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 94/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her central venous pressure is 20 mmHg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a cesarean section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta at 35 weeks of gestation. She experienced massive blood loss during the operation and received a significant amount of blood products and intravenous fluids. Despite this, she continued to ooze blood from the cervical area and required thrombin application and additional lap pads in the abdomen. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Blood Loss: The patient had massive intraoperative blood loss, which resulted in a decreased hematocrit (Hct) level and low platelet count. She is at risk for further bleeding and requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
2. Intra-abdominal Compartment Syndrome: Due to the extensive bleeding and the placement of lap pads in the abdomen, there is a risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient's peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) will be closely monitored, and bladder pressure measurements have been avoided due to ongoing bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient has received empiric antibiotics while her abdomen was packed. There is still a risk of infection, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be continued.
4. Respiratory Failure: Despite the massive resuscitation, the patient's oxygenation remains stable. She will continue to receive full ventilatory support until she comes back from surgery.
5. Insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM): The patient has a history of IDDM and requires insulin infusion for glycemic control.
6. Tachycardia: The patient has a sinus tachycardia, which is likely related to volume depletion and pain. The tachycardia is trending down.
7. Sedation: The patient is currently sedated with fentanyl and versed.
8. Feeding: The patient is currently nil per os (NPO), meaning she is not receiving any oral intake. Her ionized calcium level is within a good range.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient will receive nutrition through other means since she is NPO.
- Glycemic Control: The patient will be managed with insulin infusion to control her blood glucose levels.
- Lines: The patient has an arterial line, central line, and peripheral line in place.
- Prophylaxis: She is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient is in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her postoperative complications. She requires careful attention to her fluid balance, blood counts, and organ function to ensure optimal recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a cesarean section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive intraoperative blood loss and required laparotomy pads in the abdomen. The patient is currently in the ICU, sedated, and intubated. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving IV fluids and blood products as needed. She is also on empiric antibiotics while her abdomen is packed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient had massive intraoperative blood loss and her abdomen was packed during surgery. This increases the risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome, which can cause organ dysfunction and tissue damage.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on full ventilator support despite having good respiratory system compliance and oxygenation. This may be due to the significant volume load and plan for an upcoming operation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has received massive transfusions of blood products, which can lead to coagulopathy and bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters, such as platelet count, fibrinogen levels, and clotting times, is necessary.
4. Infection: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics while her abdomen is packed, but she is still at risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. During the operation, she experienced massive intraoperative blood loss, leading to ongoing ooze and the need for lap pads to be left in the abdomen. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and on mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include transfusion with blood products, tachycardia responding to IV fluids for pain control, and no new information obtained from the patient as she is sedated and intubated.

Allergies are documented, and the last doses of antibiotics were administered on 06/16/2018 at 09:43 PM (Ciprofloxacin), 06/17/2018 at 07:30 AM (Vancomycin), and 06/18/2018 at 09:06 AM (Metronidazole).

Infusions include midazolam (Versed) at 6 mg/hour and other ICU medications. Other medications are per review in the specified month.

There are no changes to the medical and family history, review of systems, or physical examination except where noted.

Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 120-141 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/63 to 237/156 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 100%, and temperature within normal limits.

","The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent surgery for placenta percreta and experienced massive intraoperative blood loss. She is currently in the ICU and is hemodynamically stable, but at risk for developing abdominal compartment syndrome due to the packing of her abdomen during surgery. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 88/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator.

The patient has received blood transfusions and is being monitored closely for any signs of complications. She is also receiving medications for pain control, infection prevention, and insulin to manage her diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Blood Loss: The patient may continue to bleed or develop coagulopathy due to the massive blood loss during surgery.
2. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's abdomen was packed during surgery, which puts her at risk for developing abdominal compartment syndrome. This condition occurs when there is increased pressure within the abdomen, leading to compromised blood flow and organ dysfunction.
3. Infection: As the patient underwent surgery and has multiple lines and tubes, she is at risk for developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), or catheter-related urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent an operation for placenta percreta and experienced massive intraoperative blood loss. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being closely monitored. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are as follows:
1. Acute Blood Loss: The patient has a history of massive blood loss during surgery, which has resulted in ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of hematocrit (Hct) levels, platelet count, and coagulation factors is necessary. Frequent transfusions may be required to maintain adequate blood volume and prevent further complications.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. This suggests a concern for infection, possibly due to the invasive nature of the surgery or the presence of foreign objects in the abdomen.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a controlled mode ventilation (CMV) assist. Oxygenation is stable, but there is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) given the tachycardia and low-grade fever. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest is planned to rule out PE.
4. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM): The patient requires insulin gtt for glycemic control. This suggests the possibility of pre-existing or surgery-induced IDDM.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to volume depletion, pain, or potential PE. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
6. Pain Control: The patient requires effective pain management, including fentanyl boluses and weaning down the continuous infusion. There is a concern for inadequate pain control and associated complications.
7. Feeding and Nutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), and enteral feeding may be considered once the patient is hemodynamically stable.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various complications related to acute blood loss, infection, respiratory failure, diabetes, tachycardia, pain control, and nutritional support. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are crucial for the patient's well-being."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a cesarean section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive intraoperative bleeding, leading to a massive transfusion and the placement of lap pads in the abdomen. The patient was sent to the ICU for further management. She remains hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 133 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 99/75 mmHg to 171/167 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory values indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL and a hematocrit of 34.1%. Her platelet count is normal, but coagulation parameters are abnormal with prolonged PT and PTT, and a low fibrinogen level. Blood cultures are pending, and imaging studies are being arranged.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's condition remains critical due to the massive intraoperative bleeding and subsequent massive transfusion. She is at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome, but pressures remain within normal limits. The patient's respiratory function is stable, and she will continue to be monitored with arterial blood gases. Diuretics will be used to manage fluid balance.

The patient is also being evaluated for pulmonary embolism due to tachycardia. Empirical"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a hysterectomy due to placenta percreta and experienced massive intraoperative blood loss. She was diuresed about 700cc during the day and extubated without difficulty at 4pm. The patient reported some nausea during the afternoon, which was managed with PRN medication. It is mentioned that prolactin and cortisol levels should be added to the AM labs for an unknown reason. The patient is aware of her hysterectomy and will need a lactation consult for assistance with lactation due to her prolonged ICU stay. She became agitated overnight and was switched from fentanyl boluses to prn morphine. A disconjugate gaze and confusion were observed, prompting consideration of a CT scan. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and she has received various antibiotics since admission. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/82mmHg to 141/89mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has increased from 91 kg at admission to 113.7 kg currently. Her review of systems is unchanged except for dysconjugate gaze and transient confusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent a cesarean section and hysterectomy due to placenta percreta. She experienced massive intraoperative blood loss and required a repeat exploration yesterday. The patient was extubated successfully yesterday and is currently receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. Her oxygen delivery device is a nasal cannula, and she has a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 32. She has been given fentanyl and morphine for pain control.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 130/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation between 95-97% on 2 liters. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 14 mmHg. She has received a total of 3,442 mL of fluids and lost 4,175 mL of blood products, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 733 mL. 

Her laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, leukocyte count of 200 K/uL, platelet count of 174 K/uL, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 85 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate mild elevation in white blood cell count and lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal multifocal pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment includes dysconjugate gaze, which resolves with focusing and may indicate a potential infarct bleed. She remains stable post-operatively, but further evaluation is needed. The patient has multifocal pneumonia on CT, but it is asymptomatic with low-grade temperatures and mild white blood cell elevation. She was successfully extubated yesterday and should follow-up with a chest X-ray. Broad antibiotics should be continued for post-operative care and reassessment of the length of antibiotic course for pneumonia.

The patient also exhibits signs of volume overload, so gentle diuresis will be conducted today for a negative fluid balance. Tachycardia is present in sinus rhythm, and a CT scan has ruled out pulmonary embolism. Pain control is being managed with fentanyl and morphine, considering the possibility of patient-controlled analgesia if necessary. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 1 (IDDM) should be managed with insulin per protocol, and she remains NPO due to ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support and previous massive blood loss may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and volume overload indicate possible cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Infection: The presence of multifocal pneumonia and positive peritoneal swab culture for Group B Streptococcus suggest a risk of infection, including hospital-acquired pneumonia and sepsis.

4. Neurological Complications: The patient's dysconjugate gaze, although resolving with focusing, may indicate a potential neurological complication such as a stroke or brain bleed.

5. Bleeding/Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's massive intraoperative blood loss and ongoing negative fluid balance raise concerns about ongoing bleeding and hemodynamic instability.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with placenta percreta who is currently in the ICU. She underwent a cesarean section and experienced massive intra-operative blood loss. The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. Her respiratory rate is slightly elevated. She is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is maintaining a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's weight has increased since admission, and she has received a significant amount of fluid and blood products. She is still unable to tolerate oral intake and is receiving nutrition through other means. Her pain is being managed, but she experiences nausea secondary to narcotics. The patient's insulin gtt has been held, and fingersticks are being performed q6H. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has completed a seven-day course of antibiotics for multifocal pneumonia, and her chest X-ray is stable. However, she still has an indwelling multi-lumen line and is at risk for developing a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
2. Volume Overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products, resulting in a positive fluid balance. This could lead to volume overload and subsequent complications such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been running in the range of 100-140 mg/dL."

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta percreta who has undergone a cesarean section. She experienced massive intraoperative blood loss, leading to acute blood loss anemia. She also has multifocal pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics that cover various bacteria including ESBL's, MRSA, pseudomonas, and anaerobes. The patient's blood glucose levels are within the range of 100-140 mg/dL, and insulin has been temporarily held. She is experiencing nausea and dysphoria due to narcotics, so pain management is being adjusted. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 142/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving fluids and blood products as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's massive intraoperative blood loss has resulted in acute blood loss anemia. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Close monitoring of her hemodynamic status and timely transfusion of blood products will be necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Monitoring for clinical improvement and adjusting the antibiotic regimen based on culture results will be important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with a diagnosis of placenta percreta who experienced massive intraoperative blood loss. She has been in the ICU since then and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and is experiencing nausea and dysphoria due to the use of narcotics for pain control. Her vital signs are stable, but she has been running a mild fever. Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt). Imaging studies reveal asymmetry in the lateral frontal ventricular horns, but no acute hemorrhage or masses. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of multifocal pneumonia, which is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen as necessary is crucial.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's IDDM requires close monitoring of blood sugar levels, especially since her insulin gtt has been held. Frequent fingerstick glucose measurements and appropriate adjustment of insulin therapy are essential.
3. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea secondary to narcotics may require alternative pain management strategies, such as switching to non-opioid analgesics like NSAIDs or considering other options for nausea control.
4. Blood Clots: Due to prolonged immobilization and critical illness, the patient is at risk of developing deep vein"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with a diagnosis of placenta percreta who underwent a cesarean section and experienced massive intraoperative blood loss, requiring repeat exploration and external aortic balloon occlusion. She has been in the ICU since then and is currently extubated. The patient presents with dysconjugate gaze, which resolved spontaneously, and shows signs of multifocal pneumonia on CT. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being reassessed for the course of pneumonia. The patient also has low-grade temperatures, which will be monitored and treated accordingly. She is experiencing nausea and pain, for which she is receiving appropriate medications. The patient is also dealing with a possible volume overload, tachycardia, postoperative ileus, asthma, and IDDM. The assessment and plan include monitoring vital signs, managing pain and nausea, addressing potential complications such as pneumonia, ileus, and volume overload, and providing appropriate care for her medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, and it is important to monitor and treat it appropriately to prevent further complications.
2. Volume overload: The patient shows signs of volume overload, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure if not managed properly.
3. Postoperative ileus: The patient is experiencing a postoperative ileus, which can cause bowel obstruction and delay in bowel movements. It is important"

The patient has had some postoperative complications, including dysconjugate gaze which resolved spontaneously, and multifocal pneumonia on CT scan. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for 7 days and will continue until her pneumonia is adequately treated and she no longer requires supplemental oxygen. Her low-grade fever may be due to the antibiotics. She also has leukocytosis, which is likely resolving. Foley catheter is planned to be removed once she is able to use a bedpan due to pain. The patient is currently receiving pain management with Toradol and oxycodone, and nausea is likely related to narcotics. Her liver function tests will be rechecked today. She has a history of asthma and will resume her home regimen of inhaled bronchodilators. She has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and will continue with basal-bolus insulin regimen once taking oral medications. The patient is being monitored for volume overload, tachycardia, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. She is currently NPO due to ileus but will advance to clear liquids as tolerated. The plan is to transfer her to the floor when stable."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta accreta following a cesarean section and re-exploration. She is currently being treated for group B strep infection and has completed a course of treatment for multifocal pneumonia. However, she remains critically ill with multiple complications including small bowel obstruction (SBO), abdominal fluid collection, and worsening pneumonia despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

The patient's respiratory distress was resolved with Lasix. However, she continues to have fever, crackles on lung examination, and worsening CT findings concerning for an abdominal abscess. Her blood cultures are pending, but group B strep has been identified in the peritoneal fluid.

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 9.9 to 16.9 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count ranging from 174 to 311 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Her coagulation profile shows an elevated PT/INR of 18.0/1.6, and her blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis.

Imaging studies reveal bilateral effusions on chest X-ray and a CT scan of the abdomen showing multifocal pneumonia, SBO, and an abdominal fluid collection. The patient's fluid analysis indicates an elevated white blood cell count in the fluid.

The patient's current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta accreta who underwent a hysterectomy and re-exploration. She is currently experiencing respiratory distress, multifocal pneumonia, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and an abdominal fluid collection. The patient has allergies to penicillins and has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for her infections. Her vital signs are stable, but she is tachypneic. Imaging shows bilateral effusions and some improved aeration in the lungs, as well as evidence of a possible abdominal abscess or seroma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is not resolving despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for seven days. This indicates a potential complication that may require an adjustment in antibiotic therapy or additional interventions.
2. Non-Resolving Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's VAP is also not resolving, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality if not addressed appropriately.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The new SBO noticed on CT Abdomen could be due to an underlying inflammatory process in the abdomen, possibly related to the recent surgery or narcotics. Further evaluation and management are required to prevent further complications.
4. Abdominal Fluid Collection/Abscess: The presence of an abdominal fluid collection raises concerns about the possibility of an abscess. This needs to be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta percreta who presented with multiple complications. These complications include intrapartum hemorrhage, transient intubation, pulmonary embolism, multifocal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection, and intra-pelvic hematoma.

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. However, she continues to have fevers and worsening pneumonia despite this treatment. The sputum cultures show the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and gram-negative rods. The patient is penicillin-allergic.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's multifocal pneumonia is not responding to the current antibiotic regimen. Therefore, meropenem will be added for extended coverage after desensitization, along with ongoing vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Bronchoscopy may be considered if the sputum cultures do not reveal the causative organism.

The patient also has a confirmed GBS infection, for which meropenem has been added for adequate coverage. The intra-abdominal fluid collection that was drained revealed a hematoma rather than an abscess.

The patient has a pulmonary embolism, for which she is being continued on heparin. The intra-pelvic hematoma has been successfully drained.

Other issues include small bowel"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta percreta, who has experienced multiple complications during her stay in the ICU. These complications include intrapartum hemorrhage, transient intubation, pulmonary embolism, multifocal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection, intra-pelvic hematoma, and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole, but her condition has worsened with fevers and increasing leukocytosis. She is allergic to penicillins and has an elevated INR indicating a coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal PNA: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's pneumonia has worsened, indicating the need for more effective coverage.
2. GBS infection: The patient has a confirmed GBS infection in the peritoneal cavity, which has not improved with current antibiotic therapy.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has an acute pulmonary embolism to the apical segmental branch of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.
4. Intra-pelvic hematoma: The patient had a successful CT-guided drainage of the intra-pelvic hematoma, but cultures are pending.
5. SBO: The patient presents with bilious vomiting and a history"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta accreta after a hysterectomy and c-section. She was admitted to the ICU for treatment of group B strep infection and multifocal pneumonia. She has since developed fevers, worsening multifocal pneumonia, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and an abdominal fluid collection. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, heparin for a new pulmonary embolism (PE), and has had meropenem desensitization initiated. Her vital signs are stable, but she is hypoxic due to multifactorial causes including fluid, pulmonary edema, and multifocal pneumonia. She also has evidence of a PE on most recent CT scan. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive multifocal pneumonia/nonresolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP): The patient's fever and worsening multifocal pneumonia indicate a potential progression of her lung infection despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. This may require further evaluation and modification of her antibiotic regimen.
2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and passing flatus suggest improvement in her SBO. However, close monitoring and management are required to prevent further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
3. Abdominal fluid collection: The presence of an abdominal fluid collection could indicate an abscess or seroma. Further evaluation, such as aspiration and analysis of the"

","The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta accreta who underwent a hysterectomy and c-section. She has been experiencing fevers, worsening multifocal pneumonia, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and an abdominal fluid collection. 

The patient has several potential medical complications based on the information provided. These include:

1. Progressive Multifocal Pneumonia/HAP (Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia): The patient has been treated for group B strep infection and completed 7 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, she continues to have fevers and worsening multifocal pneumonia despite this treatment. Further investigations, such as induced sputum culture and pan cultures, are pending. The patient may require bronchoscopy for obtaining samples and possible sedation/intubation for the procedure.

2. Group B Streptococcus Infection: The patient has a history of group B strep infection from peritoneal fluid. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat this infection.

3. Possible Abdominal Abscess/Seroma/Blood: The patient has an abdominal fluid collection that does not appear to be an abscess. Further follow-up cultures are needed to rule out any other infections.

4. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia due to multifactorial causes, including fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and multifocal pneumonia. Additional interventions may be required to improve oxygenation.

5. Pulmonary Embolism"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta percreta, hysterectomy, and intra-abdominal packing. She has been experiencing fevers and worsening pneumonia despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has a group B strep infection, pulmonary embolism, intra-pelvic hematoma, small bowel obstruction, and coagulopathy. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been NPO (nothing by mouth) for one week. Her pain and nausea are adequately controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's pneumonia is worsening despite seven days of broad-spectrum antibiotics. This suggests the possibility of VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Intra-abdominal infection: The patient has a confirmed group B strep infection, and there are signs of ongoing infection despite receiving vancomycin. There is a possibility of an intra-abdominal abscess or collection that may require drainage.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has an acute pulmonary embolism to the apical segmental branch of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery. She will need to continue heparin therapy to prevent further clot formation.
4. Intra-pelvic hematoma: The patient had a successful CT-guided drainage of the intra-pelvic hematoma. Cultures are pending, and there is a risk of recurrence or infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a history of placenta percreta, hysterectomy, and intra-abdominal packing. She had an intrapartum hemorrhage, transient intubation, pulmonary embolism, multifocal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), group B strep infection, intra-pelvic hematoma, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and coagulopathy.

24-hour events include blood cultures and urine culture being sent, as well as the recommendation for NPO status with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to the patient's ongoing infections. She is also being evaluated for placement of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, and she had a previous reaction of anaphylaxis to metronidazole. She has received various antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 157/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her weight is currently 104.6 kg, and she is receiving TPN and heparin intravenously.

The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 thousand/mm3, elevated hematocrit of 32.2%, platelet count of 228 thousand/mm3, and creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate possible infection with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactic acid levels, as well as signs of dehydration.

Imaging reveals worsening multifocal pneumonia and an intra-pelvic hematoma that has been drained but not yet cultured. The patient also has a pulmonary embolism, small bowel obstruction, and evidence of a group B strep infection.

Assessment and plan:
1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is worsening despite seven days of broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. She requires continued treatment with the current antibiotic regimen and further investigation by an infectious disease specialist.
2. Group B strep infection: The patient has confirmed group B strep infection that has not responded to vancomycin. She is being treated with meropenem for adequate coverage, and cultures are pending.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has an acute pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobe pulmonary artery. She should be switched to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) due to access issues.
4. Intra-pelvic hematoma: The patient's intra-pelvic hematoma has been successfully drained, and cultures are pending.
5. Small bowel obstruction: The patient is experiencing bilious vomiting and has a history of hysterectomy and placental implantation on the bowel"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of placenta accreta after a hysterectomy and c-section, as well as being treated for group B strep infection and completed 7 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics for multifocal pneumonia. She was transferred back to the MICU with fevers, worsening multifocal pneumonia, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and abdominal fluid collection.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 152/86 mmHg to 115/69 mmHg, heart rate between 85-150 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation between 97-100% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the right lung base and diminished breath sounds on the left side. The abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present but tender diffusely. Extremities show edema in both legs, and there is muscle wasting noted. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, responds appropriately, and shows purposeful movements.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and elevated platelet count. Blood cultures are pending. Imaging studies show no new findings, but there is evidence of an abdominal fluid collection. Microbiology results indicate the presence of group B strep and gram-positive rods in the hematoma fluid, while sputum samples show the presence of"
