   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and a recent cholecystectomy who presents with severe abdominal pain and likely acute pancreatitis. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of amylase and lipase, suggesting pancreatitis. The CT scan from the OSH showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis.

The plan for the patient includes aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, serial abdominal exams, and follow-up MRCP to assess for the presence of a stone or pancreatic necrosis. If necrosis is confirmed, the patient will be started on imipenem.

The patient is also intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status, which is most likely secondary to sedative medications. The goal is to wean vent settings as tolerated and re-evaluate for possible extubation in the morning.

The patient has a history of long-standing EtOH abuse, and social work consult has been requested. The patient will receive MVI, thiamine, and folate IV daily.

Access and lines need to be managed, including replacing the L infraclavicular line and A-line placed at OSH. Prophylaxis measures include heparin SQ for DVT prevention, an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis with the head of bed elevated.

- The patient's lipase levels were elevated at the OSH, now trending down, and CT scan showed pancreatitis with concern for pancreatic necrosis.
- She remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
- The most likely etiology of pancreatitis is EtOH pancreatitis, but gall stone pancreatitis cannot be ruled out.
- ERCP service, GI, and surgery are aware of the situation.
- The patient is NPO, receiving aggressive IVF with NS at 200cc/h, and will have serial abdominal exams.
- MRCP obtained overnight, and if it suggests the presence of a stone, ERCP will be called.
- If MRCP confirms pancreatic necrosis, imipenem will be started.
- Follow-up OSH imaging and surgery recommendations will be obtained.
- The patient has altered mental status likely secondary to sedative medications.
- She is intubated for airway protection.
- Pressure support will be continued, and vent settings will be weaned as tolerated.
- Sedation will be minimized to improve mental status, and re-evaluation for possible extubation will occur in the AM.
- If mental status does not improve with sedation on hold, a CT Head will be considered to evaluate for cerebral fluid shifts.
- The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy, presenting with severe abdominal pain and likely acute pancreatitis. She has been intubated for airway protection and is currently sedated. Her condition is being monitored closely, and various tests and treatments are being implemented to manage her multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels and imaging studies showing pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis. This condition requires close monitoring, and further interventions such as ERCP or surgery may be necessary depending on the findings from MRCP.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to sedative medications. Weaning off sedation and minimizing its use will be attempted to improve her mental status. If there is no improvement, a CT Head may be considered to evaluate for cerebral fluid shifts or intracranial process.
3. EtOH Abuse: The patient has a history of long-standing EtOH abuse. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal, providing MVI, thiamine, folate IV daily, considering CIWA scale, and arranging social work consult are important to address this issue.
4. HTN: The patient's high blood pressure could be related to EtOH withdrawal or other underlying causes. Continuing Metoprolol, using hydralazine prn, and restarting an ACE inhibitor will be part of the management.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and likely acute pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.0 C (100.4 F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm
- Blood pressure: 137/74 mmHg (95/48-183/89 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm
- Central venous pressure: 10 mmHg

The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She is also receiving IV fluids, sedative medications, and antibiotics prophylaxis. Laboratory results show elevated levels of lipase, amylase, and liver enzymes, indicating pancreatitis.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is sedated and non-responsive to painful stimuli, likely due to sedative medications.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated to SBPs in the 180s, which could be consistent with ethanol withdrawal.
3. Ethanol abuse: The patient has a history of long-standing ethanol abuse, and it is unclear when her last drink was.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms, elevated lipase and amyl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, and multiple interventions have been initiated. These include arterial and multi-lumen lines, invasive ventilation, and medication infusions such as fentanyl, versed, metoprolol, famotidine, heparin sodium, and hydralazine. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and heart rate. Fluid balance is being closely monitored, and respiratory support is provided through CPAP/PSV mode with oxygen delivery via an endotracheal tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to invasive ventilation.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Pancreatitis Complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to complications such as pseudocysts, abscesses, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
4. Drug Interactions/Toxicity: The use of multiple medications may increase the risk of drug interactions or toxicity.
5. Cardiovascular Issues: Hypotension and hypertension have been noted, indicating the need for close monitoring and potential adjustments in cardiovascular support.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be continuously assessed for any signs of worsening respiratory failure."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone various procedures and treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly elevated temperature and blood pressure within normal limits. They are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to sedation. Lab results indicate elevated levels of amylase, lipase, and other markers consistent with pancreatitis. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest acute pancreatitis. This condition can lead to complications such as infection, necrosis, or abscess formation.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness could be attributed to sedation or encephalopathy. If not attributed to sedation, further investigation for causes like infection, hypoxia, or metabolic derangements would be necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are elevated, indicating hypertension. If not appropriately managed, it may lead to complications like cardiac issues or stroke.
4. Line-related complications: With the presence of arterial and multi-lumen lines, there is a risk of infection or thrombosis.
5. Full Code: The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in case of cardiac or respiratory arrest. This decision"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The patient has acute pancreatitis, altered mental status, hypertension, and an arterial line. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, which increases the risk of acquiring infections, especially due to the presence of an arterial line and multi-lumen line.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
3. Cardiovascular problems: The patient has hypertension, which may require adjustment of medications and close monitoring of blood pressure.
4. Complications related to pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis can lead to local and systemic complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, and sepsis.
5. Delirium or encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to sedation or underlying brain pathology. Close monitoring of neurological status is necessary.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, and prophylaxis should be given to reduce this risk.

These are potential complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy who presented with severe abdominal pain and likely acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, requiring intubation for airway protection. Her pancreatitis is severe, with elevated lipase levels and evidence of pancreatic necrosis on imaging. She has been managed with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pain control. The etiology of her pancreatitis is most likely related to alcohol use, although gallstone pancreatitis cannot be completely ruled out. Other complications include hypertension, possible ethanol withdrawal, and altered mental status likely due to sedative medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition can worsen if the inflammation spreads to surrounding tissues or if there is development of infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcoholism, there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, which may indicate ongoing stress response or potential organ dysfunction. If left uncontrolled, it could lead to end-organ damage.
4. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can be a life-threatening infection.
5. Deep vein thromb"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presents from an OSH with severe abdominal
   pain and likely acute pancreatitis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated to 4788 at the OSH, now trending
   down. OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis.
   She remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Most likely, given her
   history of EtOH and cholecystectomy, EtOH pancreatitis is most likely
   etiology. Gall stone pancreatitis cannot be ruled out. ERCP service, GI
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] are aware.  MRCP obtained o/n.
   -NPO
   -aggressive IVF with NS at 200cc/h
   -serial abdominal exams
   -f/u MRCP read
   -if MRCP suggests presence of stone, will call ERCP
   -if MRCP confirms pancreatic necrosis, will start imipenem
   -f/u OSH imaging
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to sedative medications
   she was receiving at OSH including dilaudid, ativan, and precedex. Pt
   intubated for airway protection.
   - cont pressure support, wean vent settings as tolerated
   - attempt to minimize sedation to improve MS
   - will re-eval for possible extubation in the AM (after completing
   imaging studies)
   - if MS does not improve with sedation on hold, will consider CT Head
   to evaluate for cerebral fluid shifts in the setting of recent ativan
   drip at OSH vs acute intracranial process
   .
   # EtOH abuse: History of long-standing EtOH abuse. Unclear when last
   drink was however has been in hospital since [**10-12**]. No current signs of
   withdrawal, but patient is significantly sedated.
   - MVI, thiamine, folate IV daily
   - Consider CIWA scale
   - social work consult
   .
   # HTN: HTN to SBPs 190s o/n. Could be consistent with EtOH withdrawal.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID
   - Hydralazine prn
   - Restart Ace-I
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete lytes prn, NPO
   .
   # Access: L infraclavicular line and A-line placed at OSH will need to
   be replaced today
   .
   # PPx: heparin SQ, h2 blocker, VAP prophylaxis, HOB elevated

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy. She presented to the hospital with severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The patient's current condition includes pancreatitis with concern for pancreatic necrosis, altered mental status likely due to sedative medications, possible ethanol abuse, hypertension, and fluid-electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, pseudocyst formation, and systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS).
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may progress to worsening confusion, disorientation, or even coma if sedation is not minimized or if there is an underlying intracranial process.
3. Ethanol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of long-standing ethanol abuse, there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen and potentially lead to complications like intracranial hemorrhage or heart failure if not managed appropriately.
5. Fluid-Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an imbalance in fluid and electrolytes, which can lead to complications such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and electrolyte abnormalities.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and intervene promptly to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presents from an OSH with severe abdominal
   pain and likely acute pancreatitis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated to 4788 at the OSH, now trending
   down. OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis.
   She remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Most likely, given her
   history of EtOH and cholecystectomy, EtOH pancreatitis is most likely
   etiology. Gall stone pancreatitis cannot be ruled out. ERCP service, GI
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] are aware.  MRCP [**10-16**] showed
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

   # Altered mental status/Ventilator: Most likely secondary to sedative
   medications she was receiving at OSH including dilaudid, ativan, and
   precedex. Pt intubated for airway protection.  Some concern for Dts
   given autonomic dysfx, fever and delta MS.
   - cont pressure support, wean vent settings as tolerated
   - attempt to minimize sedation to improve MS
   - lighten sedation and attempt weaning trial
   - f/u CT head official read

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy. She presents with severe abdominal pain and is suspected to have acute pancreatitis. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with hemorrhagic pancreatitis and is showing signs of systemic inflammation with fever. There are concerns about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), alcohol withdrawal, and possible sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture grew Gram-positive cocci, indicating a possible respiratory infection. She is currently on antibiotics, but further bronchoscopic samples may be needed to identify the causative organism.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: Although the patient does not currently exhibit signs of withdrawal, her history of long-standing alcohol abuse should be monitored closely. Thiamine supplementation is important to prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible systemic infection. Prompt identification and treatment of the source of infection are crucial.
4. Pancreatitis complications: Hemorrhagic pancreatitis can lead to local and systemic complications. Monitoring for signs of worsening pancreatitis, such as abdominal pain, hypotension, and organ dysfunction, is necessary.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and it needs"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis. They have been experiencing altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypertension, and pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on multiple medications, including heparin for prophylaxis, famotidine, fentanyl, and hydralazine. They have undergone several procedures and tests, including blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine culture. The patient's vital signs and lab results are within normal limits, except for elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and lactic acid levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to mental status changes leading to intubation. Continued monitoring and management of ventilation parameters are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is trending higher, which may indicate uncontrolled hypertension. Appropriate antihypertensive medications should be considered to prevent cardiovascular complications.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and potential infection markers suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Adequate antibiotic coverage and further diagnostic tests, such as bronchoscopy, may be required for early identification and treatment.
4. Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis itself can lead to various complications, including pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammation. Close monitoring of abdominal pain, enzyme levels, and imaging studies may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. The patient's mental status has shown slight improvement overnight, but they are still unresponsive. The patient has a fever of 101.6°F and is experiencing hypertension. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood culture taken overnight shows multiple organisms, and the patient has been started on antibiotics. The urine culture has also been taken.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypertension, and a slightly elevated respiratory rate. The patient's C-reactive protein level is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs bilaterally and warm extremities. The patient is unresponsive, likely due to sedation or encephalopathy.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, hypertension, pneumonia, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and altered mental status. The patient will undergo a bronchoscopy to evaluate for pneumonia and will be placed on Vancomycin. The sedation will be held to re-evaluate the patient's mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and delirium."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is pancreatitis. The patient has experienced several events in the ICU, including a bronchoscopic procedure, unplanned extubation, EEG, and placement of a multi-lumen line and arterial line. The patient also had a fever with a temperature of 101.3°F.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including propofol, metoprolol, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, and hydralazine. The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), and they had a rash in response to antibiotics. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and imipenem/cilastatin.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within the normal range (84 bpm), blood pressure slightly elevated (115/55 mmHg), respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's central venous pressure is 9 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid status. The patient's urine output has been increasing, which is a positive sign.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 14.6 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 23.5%, and normal platelet count (Plt) at 305. The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable, ranging from 128 to 132 mg/dL. Other lab results, such as creatinine (Cr), total CO2 (TCO2), and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 418 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, indicating a slightly alkalotic state.

The patient's physical examination findings are not detailed in the progress note. The patient's neurological status is described as altered mental status but not delirium.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute pancreatitis, and altered mental status. The pneumonia is ventilator-acquired (VAP), and the pancreatitis appears to be related to the patient's condition.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's altered mental status may increase the risk of delirium or worsening confusion. The presence of fever and pneumonia suggests a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not managed appropriately. The patient's pancreatitis can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation if not treated adequately. Additionally, the patient's pneumonia increases the risk of respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated events or respiratory failure.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in mental status, respiratory distress, or signs of infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presents from an OSH with severe abdominal
   pain and likely acute pancreatitis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated to 4788 at the OSH, now trending
   down. OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis.
   She remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Most likely, given her
   history of EtOH and cholecystectomy, EtOH pancreatitis is most likely
   etiology. Gall stone pancreatitis cannot be ruled out. ERCP service, GI
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] are aware.  MRCP [**10-16**] showed
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

   potentially consistent with mulilobarl pna.
   - Add Vancomycin 1 g [**Hospital1 **].
   - fu cx data
   - bronch samples
   .
   # Altered mental status/Ventilator: Most likely secondary to sedative
   medications she was receiving at OSH including dilaudid, ativan, and
   precedex. Pt intubated for airway protection.  Some concern for Dts
   given autonomic dysfx, fever and delta MS.
   - cont pressure support, wean vent settings as tolerated
   - attempt to minimize sedation to improve MS
   - lighten sedation and attempt weaning trial
   - f/u CT head official read
   - EEG to evaluate for seizure activity and nonconvulsive status
   epelepticus
   - Bronchoscopy for sputum samples
   .
   # EtOH abuse: History of long-standing EtOH abuse. Unclear when last
   drink was however has been in hospital since [**10-12**]. No current signs of
   withdrawal, but patient is significantly sedated.
   - MVI, thiamine, folate IV daily
   - social work consult
   .
   # HTN: HTN to SBPs 200s o/n. Could be consistent with EtOH withdrawal
   vs pain/agitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy.
- She presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and is suspected to have acute pancreatitis.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypertension, altered mental status, and ethanol abuse.
- She has undergone several interventions and procedures, including bronchoscopy, central line placement, arterial line placement, and administration of multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient likely has acute pancreatitis, which is characterized by inflammation of the pancreas. This can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammation.
2. VAP: The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs acquired while using a mechanical ventilator. Complications can include worsening respiratory function, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may lead to complications like stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage if not properly managed.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's sedation and altered mental status can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
5. Ethanol abuse: The patient's history of alcoholism increases the risk of liver damage, gastrointestinal bleeding, malnutrition, and withdrawal symptoms upon cessation of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and had an unplanned extubation. They were also started on multi-lumen and arterial lines.

The patient's temperature is 101.3°F (fever), blood pressure is 115/55 mmHg, heart rate is 84 bpm, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is not mentioned.

The patient has been intubated and sedated, with pinpoint and sluggishly responsive pupils. They have a nasogastric tube (NGT) with bilious drainage and a Dobhoff catheter. Physical examination findings include jaundice, tense and distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds, and cool hands and feet.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), slightly low platelet count (Plt), and normal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level (K+).

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute pancreatitis. The plan includes continued ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, line management,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presents from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated to 4788 at the OSH, now trending
   down. OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis.
   She remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Given her history of
   EtOH and cholecystectomy, EtOH pancreatitis is most likely etiology.
   MRCP [**10-16**] showed hemorrhagic pancreatitis without ductal dilitation.
   -Holding on TPN temporarily given concern for sepsis. Will readdress
   nutrition with GI and place feeding tube postpyloric if gut feeding is
   appropriate
   -aggressive IVF based on goal UOP 30-40 cc/hr
   -serial abdominal exams
   -Continue Imipenem to prevent infected necrosis ([**10-16**]- )
   - f/u surgery ([**Last Name (un) 2625**]) and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. CX data negative Patient
   having fevers and CXR potentially consistent with mulilobarl pna.
   - Continue Vancomycin 1 g [**Hospital1 **] ([**10-17**]- ) and Imipenem ([**10-16**] - ).
   - fu cx data
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Altered mental status/Ventilator: Most likely secondary to sedative
   medications she was receiving at OSH including dilaudid, ativan, and
   precedex. Pt intubated for airway protection.  Some concern for Dts
   given autonomic dysfx, fever and delta MS.
   - cont pressure support, wean vent settings as tolerated
   - attempt to minimize sedation to improve MS (hold propafol)
   - lighten sedation and attempt weaning trial
   - Consider LP if MS does not improve (per report pt did have Has b/f
   presentation to OSH)
   - f/u CT head official read
   - f/u EEG re: seizure activity
   - Bronchoscopy for sputum samples
   .
   # EtOH abuse: History of long-standing EtOH abuse. Unclear when last
   drink was however has been in hospital since [**10-12**]. No current signs of
   withdrawal, but patient is significantly sedated.
   - vitamins daily
   - social work consult when MS improves
   .
   # HTN: HTN to SBPs 200s o/n. Could be consistent with EtOH withdrawal
   vs pain/agitation.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID and Enaliprat.1.25 q6
   - Hydralazine q6
   - A line for pressure monitoring
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete lytes prn, ISS, NPO
   .
   # Access: A line ([**10-17**]), central line LIJ ([**10-17**]), peripheral iv x 2

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy who presented with acute pancreatitis. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile. The most likely etiology of her pancreatitis is ethanol-induced, considering her history of EtOH abuse and the findings on MRCP.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels were elevated at the OSH but are now trending down. The CT scan showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis. Aggressive IV fluids are being administered based on the goal urine output of 30-40 cc/hr. Serial abdominal exams will be conducted, and the patient will continue on Imipenem to prevent infected necrosis. Surgery and GI recommendations will be followed up.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has significant GPCs in sputum GS, indicating possible VAP. She has been experiencing fevers, and her CXR is potentially consistent with multi-lobar pneumonia. The patient will continue on Vancomycin and Imipenem. CX data will be followed up, and VAP precautions will be maintained.

3. Altered mental status/Ventilator: The patient's altered mental status is most likely secondary to sedative medications. She is intubated for airway protection. There is some concern for delirium tremens given"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presents from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated to 4788 at the OSH, now trending
   down. OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis.
   She remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Given her history of
   EtOH and cholecystectomy, EtOH pancreatitis is most likely etiology.
   MRCP [**10-16**] showed hemorrhagic pancreatitis without ductal dilitation.
   -TPN until MS improves and then plan to start post-pyloric feeding
   -aggressive IVF based on goal UOP 30-40 cc/hr
   -serial abdominal exams
   -Continue Imipenem to prevent infected necrosis ([**10-16**]- )
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. CX data negative Patient
   having fevers and CXR potentially consistent with mulilobarl pna.
   - Continue Vancomycin 1 g [**Hospital1 **] ([**10-17**]- ) and Imipenem ([**10-16**] - ).
   - fu cx data
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Altered mental status/Ventilator: Most likely secondary to sedative
   medications she was receiving at OSH including dilaudid, ativan, and
   precedex. Pt intubated for airway protection.  Some concern for Dts
   given autonomic dysfx, fever and delta MS.
   - cont pressure support, wean vent settings as tolerated
   - attempt to minimize sedation to improve MS
   - lighten sedation and attempt weaning trial
   - f/u CT head official read
   - f/u EEG re: seizure activity
   - Bronchoscopy for sputum samples
   .
   # EtOH abuse: History of long-standing EtOH abuse. Unclear when last
   drink was however has been in hospital since [**10-12**]. No current signs of
   withdrawal, but patient is significantly sedated.
   - MVI, thiamine, folate IV daily
   - social work consult
   .
   # HTN: HTN to SBPs 200s o/n. Could be consistent with EtOH withdrawal
   vs pain/agitation.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID and Enaliprat.
   - Hydralazine q6
   - A line for pressure monitoring

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy. She presented to the emergency department with acute pancreatitis and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, which is likely due to ethanol abuse. She also has a history of VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) and altered mental status, possibly secondary to sedative medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, infection of the necrotic tissue, and abscess formation.
2. VAP: The patient has a history of VAP, which increases the risk of developing respiratory infections, particularly pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory function and potentially sepsis.
3. Ethanol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation of alcohol. Symptoms may include agitation, tremors, seizures, and delirium tremens.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which can lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage if not managed properly.
5. Malnutrition: Due to the patient's inability to eat orally and being on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), there is a risk of malnutrition and associated complications like impaired wound healing, weakened immune system, and decreased muscle mass.

Please note that this summary and potential complications"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator acquired (VAP): The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an infection.

2. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has elevated levels of amylase and lipase, indicating pancreatic inflammation. This could be due to alcohol abuse or another cause. Pancreatitis can lead to complications such as infected hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive despite no sedation, indicating a significant change in mental status. This could be related to encephalopathy or other neurological issues. An EEG and MRI have been ordered to further evaluate the cause.

4. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which may contribute to the development of pancreatitis and other complications.

5. ICU care: The patient requires ongoing supportive care, including nutrition, glycemic control, line management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presents from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis:Enzymes resolved.  Continues to be jaundiced.
   Significant volume overload given resuscitation.
   OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis. She
   remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Given her history of EtOH
   and cholecystectomy, EtOH pancreatitis is most likely etiology. MRCP
   [**10-16**] showed hemorrhagic pancreatitis without ductal dilitation.
   -Holding on TPN temporarily given concern for sepsis. Will readdress
   nutrition with GI and place feeding tube postpyloric if gut feeding is
   appropriate
   -aggressive IVF based on goal UOP 30-40 cc/hr
   -serial abdominal exams
   -Continue Imipenem to prevent infected necrosis ([**10-16**]- )
   - f/u surgery ([**Last Name (un) 2625**]) and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. CX data negative Patient
   having fevers and CXR potentially consistent with mulilobarl pna.
   - Continue Vancomycin 1 g [**Hospital1 **] ([**10-17**]- ) and Imipenem ([**10-16**] - ).
   - fu cx data
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Altered mental status/Ventilator: Most likely secondary to sedative
   medications she was receiving at OSH including dilaudid, ativan, and
   precedex. Pt intubated for airway protection.  Some concern for Dts
   given autonomic dysfx, fever and delta MS.
   - cont pressure support, wean vent settings as tolerated
   - attempt to minimize sedation to improve MS (hold propafol)
   - lighten sedation and attempt weaning trial
   - Consider LP if MS does not improve (per report pt did have Has b/f
   presentation to OSH)
   - f/u CT head official read
   - f/u EEG re: seizure activity
   - Bronchoscopy for sputum samples
   # EtOH abuse: History of long-standing EtOH abuse. Unclear when last
   drink was however has been in hospital since [**10-12**]. No current signs of
   withdrawal, but patient is significantly sedated.
   - social work consult when MS improves
   .
   # HTN: HTN to SBPs 200s o/n. Could be consistent with EtOH withdrawal
   vs pain/agitation.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID and Enaliprat.1.25 q6
   - Hydralazine q6

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis and has since developed several medical complications.

1. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Ventilator Acquired (VAP): The patient's respiratory culture showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive, indicating a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia. She is being treated with Vancomycin and Imipenem.

2. Pancreatitis, Acute: The patient initially presented with acute pancreatitis, which has since resolved but she remains jaundiced. She had a CT scan that showed concern for pancreatic necrosis, likely due to alcohol-induced pancreatitis. Her enzymes have resolved, but she continues to be jaundiced.

3. Altered Mental Status/Ventilator: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to sedative medications she was receiving. She is intubated for airway protection, and there is concern for delirium tremens (DTs) given autonomic dysfunction, fever, and altered mental status.

4. Ethanol Abuse: The patient has a history of long-standing ethanol abuse. Although it is unclear when she last consumed alcohol, there are no current signs of withdrawal. However, she is significantly sedated.

5. Hypertension: The patient experienced SBPs in the 200s overnight, which could be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis and subsequent transfer to the medical floor. The patient has a history of previous admissions for pancreatitis. Upon admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 101.4°F and had a blood culture drawn. An MRI of the head was also performed, revealing no intracranial abnormalities but noting adipose accumulation over the right malar eminence and air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus.

The patient has been intubated and non-responsive. Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate ranging from 71-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/49-176/77 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 18-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 411 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium. Imaging studies reveal no evidence of hemorrhage or infarction in the brain but show adipose accumulation over the right"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and cholecystectomy who presented to the emergency department with acute pancreatitis. She has been admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

24-hour events include fever, a blood culture, and an MRI of the head. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains intubated and non-responsive. The review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the development of pneumonia, which is suspected to be ventilator-associated.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's enzymes have resolved, but she continues to be jaundiced. She has significant volume overload, and her urine output is increasing. She is hemodynamically stable and afebrile but requires Tylenol on standing. Her white blood cell count is rising, and she is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) temporarily due to concerns for sepsis. Postpyloric gut feeding is recommended, and she needs serial abdominal exams.
2. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient has sputum gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Her CX data are negative. She will continue on vancomycin and imipenem to prevent infected necrosis and treat VAP. VAP precautions will be continued.
3. Altered mental status/Ventilator: The patient's EEG shows no evidence of seizures and is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple ongoing medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is persistent mental status changes, fever, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/51 mmHg to 176/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 13 mmHg.

The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, as evidenced by elevated amylase levels. There is concern for infected necrotic pancreatitis due to the persistent fever. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Imipenem and Vancomycin) for potential infection.

The patient also has persistent mental status changes despite holding sedation, which may suggest hepatic encephalopathy or another underlying neurological condition. Further evaluation with a lumbar puncture (LP) and lactulose administration is planned.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, a tidal volume (Vt) of 376 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with ongoing health issues. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute pancreatitis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. They also have hypertension and are experiencing persistent fever. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a potential complication in this case due to the patient's prolonged intubation.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: This condition can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or infected pancreatic necrosis.
3. Altered Mental Status: Delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients, especially those with sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory Failure: If the patient does not improve, there is a risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure requiring more advanced interventions like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
5. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of end-organ damage and other cardiovascular complications.

It is important for the medical team to closely monitor the patient's condition, adjust treatment plans accordingly, and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy who presented with acute pancreatitis. She is now on day 5 in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues that require attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with extensive pancreatic necrosis. This condition can lead to complications such as infection, abscess formation, pseudocyst development, and persistent pain.
2. Jaundice: The patient continues to be jaundiced, which may indicate ongoing liver dysfunction or obstruction of the bile ducts due to inflammation or necrosis in the pancreas.
3. Volume Overload: The patient has significant volume overload, likely secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, hypertension, and congestive heart failure.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is rising, indicating a possible infection. Given her immunocompromised state due to alcoholism and the presence of necrotic tissue in the pancreas, there is a high risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Altered Mental Status/Ventilator: The patient has an altered mental status and is on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off sedation and attempting extubation should be done cautiously due to the risk of ventilator-associated complications.
6. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and acute pancreatitis. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamide antibiotics and is currently on multiple medications including famotidine, fentanyl, heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, and hydralazine. The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a stable central venous pressure and fluid balance. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 355 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis reveals respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.8 K/uL, elevated serum glucose levels, and increased lactate levels. The patient's renal function is normal with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. The patient's mental status is altered, and he does not exhibit any peripheral vascular or neurologic abnormalities. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute pancreatitis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with necrotizing pancreatitis and altered mental status requiring airway support. The patient has been experiencing daily fevers despite being on antibiotics, and there are concerns about potential medical complications.

1. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP): The patient has respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with an FiO2 of 40%, indicating the need for supplemental oxygen.

2. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, as indicated by elevated pancreatic enzymes. There is a plan for post-pyloric feeding using a Dobhoff tube to provide nutrition while minimizing stimulation of the pancreas.

3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status is altered, making it difficult to follow commands. However, there is improvement noted, and the decision has been made to hold off on performing a lumbar puncture (LP) and monitor the patient's condition.

4. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and no obvious sources have been identified. The patient remains on vancomycin and imipenem, which are antibiotics used to treat various bacterial infections.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a pressure of 10 cm"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of their condition. The patient has been hypertensive, and medication has been adjusted accordingly. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, revealing the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms. The respiratory culture showed the absence of oropharyngeal flora and the presence of Staphylococcus aureus coag positive at a concentration of ~1000/ml. The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and has experienced rashes as a result. The patient has received various medications including vancomycin and imipenem/cilastatin. 

The patient's vital signs show an increased temperature, stable blood pressure, and normal heart rate. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 367 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 52, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 17 cmH2O, and the oxygenation parameters are within acceptable limits. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and lactate levels."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute pancreatitis. She has been in the ICU for six days. The patient has been sedated but is now off of sedation and showing improved mental status. Her blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments. The patient has been experiencing fevers, and cultures have shown growth of MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus). She has been treated with imipenem and vancomycin, but vancomycin was discontinued yesterday. The patient's respiratory status has been stable, and she has been weaned off ventilator support. She continues to have jaundice and a rising white blood cell count. Her abdominal exam shows a tense and distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis seems to be complicated by infected necrosis, as indicated by the rising white blood cell count and the presence of MSSA in the bronchoalveolar lavage culture.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture showed significant growth of GPCs (Gram-positive cocci), and MSSA was growing on culture. This suggests a risk for VAP, which has been treated with imipenem.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has a significant volume overload, as evidenced by the high intake-output balance and edema in the extrem"

   and s/p cholecystectomy who presented from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis; now ICU day 6
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis:  CT essentially unchanged; identification of
   peripancreatic phlegmon. Continues to be jaundiced.  Significant volume
   overload given aggressive resuscitation; UOP is stable.  WBC continues
   to rise.   GI following.  LFTs rising over last 48 hours.
   - Consider RUQ u/s to evaluate for CBD dilitations and possible gall
   stones despite s/p ccy
   -serial abdominal exams
   -Continue Imipenem to treat infected necrosis (started [**10-16**], now d5 )
   - f/u surgery and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive). Vancomycin d/cd yesterday ([**Date range (1) 2691**])
   - Continue Imipenem ([**10-16**] - ).
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Altered mental status/Ventilator:  Off of sedation and mental status
   improved today.
   - cont pressure support, wean vent settings as tolerated
   - weaning trial today
   - f/c culture data for other infectious source
   # EtOH abuse: hospitalized since [**10-12**]. No current signs of withdrawal,
   but patient is significantly sedated.
   - social work consult when MS improves
   # Fevers: known sources (pancreas/lung) as above.
   - continue to monitor
   # HTN: Improved; may have been secondary to anxiety, withdrawal, fluid
   overload.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID, Hydralizine 20 q6 and
   Enaliprat.2.25 q6
   - holding home HCTZ given pancreatitis
   - A line for pressure monitoring
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy who presented with acute pancreatitis. She is now on day 6 in the ICU. The patient continues to be hypertensive, and her enalapril and hydralazine medications have been adjusted. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed no microorganisms but did reveal 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Respiratory culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, which is sensitive to imipenem. The patient has been off sedation and her mental status has improved. She is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 39°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 132/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,292 mL and output of 1,050 mL. Blood products have been transfused, and the patient's urine output is stable. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and liver enzymes. The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and altered mental status. Plan includes continuing imipenem to treat infected necrosis, monitoring for further complications, and considering a right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate for common bile duct dilation and possible gallstones"

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 367 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 52, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 17 cmH2O, and the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is 220.

The physical examination reveals diaphoresis, icteric sclera with edema, pupils constricted and sluggishly responsive, nasogastric tube (NGT) with bilious drainage, tense and distended abdomen with bowel sounds, and peripheral edema in the upper and lower extremities. The patient also has jaundiced skin.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The blood glucose level is within normal range. Liver enzymes such as alan"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with hemorrhagic pancreatitis, pneumonia (ventilator-acquired), acute pancreatitis, hypertension, and altered mental status. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fevers, impaired mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has shown some improvement over the weekend. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, abscess formation, organ failure, and pancreatic pseudocyst.

2. Pneumonia (Ventilator-acquired): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. Complications associated with this include worsening respiratory function, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may require ongoing management and can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications if not properly controlled.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication effects, or direct consequences of the underlying medical conditions. Monitoring for changes in mental status and ensuring appropriate care is essential.

Overall, close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and organ functions will be crucial in preventing and managing potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with hemorrhagic pancreatitis, on mechanical ventilation primarily for MS/airway, and ongoing fevers. She has been in the ICU for six days. The patient's condition includes pneumonia, acute pancreatitis, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is unchanged, and she will continue with bowel rest and antibiotics.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's condition has improved enough to consider weaning off mechanical ventilation. She underwent a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation this morning.
3. MSSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was previously on vancomycin, which was discontinued based on sensitivities. She is now being covered with imipenem to cover both lung and gut infections.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is temporarily improved but still high. Further management is needed to control hypertension.
5. Other plans per ICU staff include nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with hemorrhagic pancreatitis, who is currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing fevers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and altered mental status. The patient's condition has shown improvement over the weekend. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis remains unchanged, and she will continue with bowel rest and antibiotics.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved enough for consideration of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation.
3. MSSA VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). She has been switched from vancomycin to imipenem to cover both lung and gut infections.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still high and requires further management.
Other plans include nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis. The patient underwent extubation at 1100 but experienced hypertension, which was managed with hydralazine. The patient's I/O status showed a positive balance of 15 L in the am, with Lasix 20 mg given three times. The patient's ABG showed a pH of 7.43, indicating respiratory alkalosis post-extubation. Bipap was initiated but stopped due to controlled blood pressure and saturations. The patient reported left ankle pain and occasional tachycardia to 150s, with an ECG showing sinus tachycardia and possible left bundle branch block. Allergies include sulfonamide antibiotics, resulting in a rash. The patient received vancomycin and imipenem/cilastatin. Infusions include nitroglycerin, famotidine, heparin sodium, furosemide, hydralazine, morphine sulfate, and hydromorphone. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/65 to 204/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results are provided. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented to the hospital with acute pancreatitis. She is currently on day 6 in the ICU. The patient has been extubated and is receiving CPAP/PSV with FiO2 60%. Her vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing increasing abdominal pain. She also reports left ankle pain. The patient's allergies include sulfa (rash). She has been receiving various medications including hydralazine, nitroglycerin, furosemide, heparin sodium, famotidine, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient is still experiencing abdominal pain, which suggests that her pancreatitis may not have resolved completely. There is a risk of complications such as infection or necrosis of the pancreas.
2. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation and now on CPAP/PSV. There is a possibility of developing VAP due to the previous intubation.
3. Hypertension: Despite treatment with hydralazine, the patient's blood pressure remains high.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation, which may lead to fluid overload.
5. Jaundice: The patient continues to be jaundiced, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction.
6. Alcohol Withdrawal: Although the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presented from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis; now ICU day 6
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis:  CT essentially unchanged; identification of
   peripancreatic phlegmon. Continues to be jaundiced.  Significant volume
   overload given aggressive resuscitation; UOP is stable.  WBC continues
   to rise.   GI following.  LFts starting to come down.
   -serial abdominal exams
   -Per surgery, no need to cover with antibx for necrotic pancreas
   (started [**10-16**], now d5 )
   - f/u surgery and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**])
   - Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin for planned 8 day
   course of MSSA VAP
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] and saturating well. Overall volume
   up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
   -Bipap as needed for pulmonary edema
   -Lasix prn for goal I/O negative 1-2 L
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   # Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues to have
   a hoarse voice.
   - ENT consult to eval vocal cords
   # EtOH abuse: hospitalized since [**10-12**]. No current signs of withdrawal,
   but patient is significantly sedated.
   - social work consult when MS improves
   # Fevers: known sources (pancreas/lung) as above.
   - continue to monitor
   # HTN: Likely [**12-17**] to pain and volume overload.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID, Hydralizine 40 q6 and increase
   Enaliprat.2.25 q6 to 5 q 6
   - lasix prn (see above)
   - Consider adding clonidine if necessary
   - holding home HCTZ given pancreatitis
   - A line for pressure monitoring
   # Diarrhea
 Noted today. Test for Cdiff given antibx use and
   leukocytosis.
   # Hyperglycemia: In the setting of steroids.
   - Insulin gtt for better glucose control
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete lytes prn, ISS,
   -post pyloric tube placed and TFs at goal
   - free water boluses 250 cc q6 (free water deficit 2 L)

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy who presented to the hospital with acute pancreatitis. She is currently in the ICU on day 6. The patient's main medical issues include pancreatitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary edema, hoarseness of voice, ethanol abuse, fevers, hypertension, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, and fluid overload.

Assessment:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, as evidenced by elevated amylase and lipase levels. Imaging shows a peripancreatic phlegmon.
2. VAP: The patient has developed VAP, with significant growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and later identified as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Vancomycin was discontinued, and the patient is transitioning to nafcillin for planned 8-day course of MSSA VAP.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has signs consistent with pulmonary edema, including increased fluid balance and a chest X-ray consistent with this diagnosis.
4. Hoarseness of voice: The patient has a hoarse voice, likely due to traumatic intubation.
5. EtOH abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently hospitalized since October 12th.
6. Fevers: The patient has had fevers, which are likely due to known sources such as the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of pancreatitis and acute respiratory failure. They were extubated yesterday and are currently on BiPAP for presumed congestive heart failure (CHF) and laryngeal edema. The patient experienced increased abdominal pain as sedation was reduced. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows metabolic alkalosis. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has a stable hematocrit (Hct). They continue to receive intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and had a rash as a result. The patient received antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia, including Vancomycin and Imipenem/Cilastatin. 

In the 24-hour period, the patient's vital signs included a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), a heart rate of 121 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 165/82 mmHg to 109/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient was placed on invasive ventilation but was subsequently stopped. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,736 mL and output of 4,120 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,384 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support included the use of a nasal cannula and CPAP/PSV ventilator mode"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, for which they were taking enalapril, and an allergy to sulfa medications. The patient's current vital signs show tachycardia in the 140s, respiratory rate in the 30s, and blood pressure ranging from 180s to 200s. The patient has been receiving various medications including insulin, Lasix, lorazepam, and nafcillin. They have also been on a ventilator with CPAP/PSV mode, face tent oxygen delivery device, and other respiratory parameters within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of new left lower lobe opacification on the morning chest X-ray suggests the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Hyponatremia: The patient has been receiving free water boluses and Lasix, which may contribute to hyponatremia as noted in the lab results.
3. Hypertension: Despite increasing the dose of enalapril, the patient's blood pressure remains high, indicating uncontrolled hypertension.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition involves acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, necrosis, or organ failure.
5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance is of concern, with positive fluid intake and output discrepancies. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presented from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis; now ICU day 8
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis:  CT essentially unchanged; identification of
   peripancreatic phlegmon. Continues to be jaundiced.  Significant volume
   overload given aggressive resuscitation; UOP is stable.  WBC trending
   down.   GI following.  LFts continue to trend down.
   -Per surgery, no need to cover with antibx for necrotic pancreas ([**Last Name (un) 1540**]
   [**10-16**]
 [**10-22**])
   - f/u surgery and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**])
   - Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin for planned 8 day
   course of MSSA VAP to complete [**10-24**]. Given decompensation will restart
   Imipenem and d/c Naficillin.
   - VAP precautions
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx
   .
   # Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] and saturating well. Overall volume
   up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
   -Bipap as needed given tachycardia and pulmonary edema in setting of
   volume overload
   -Lasix prn for goal I/O negative 1-2 L
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   # Alkalosis: Likely [**12-17**] aggressive diuresis. Also consistent with
   hypernatremia.
   # Diarrhea: Developed on antibx. Cdiff negative x 1
   - Repeat cdiff x 2
   # Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues to have
   a hoarse voice. ENT reports vocal cords functional and will continue to
   take time to recover.
   -f/u any further ENT reccs
   - f/u with ent in 2 wks
   #  Change in Mental Status: Pt significantly more drowsy this am.
   Likely [**12-17**] to Ativan received last night.
    -Hold Benzos for now
    - repeat ABG
    - reassess MS
   # EtOH abuse: hospitalized since [**10-12**]. No current signs of withdrawal,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute pancreatitis and is currently in the ICU on day 8. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with ongoing jaundice and significant volume overload due to aggressive resuscitation. There is a peripancreatic phlegmon noted on CT scan.

2. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA (Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus) VAP. The initial antibiotic, Imipenem, has been changed to Nafcillin for an 8-day course of treatment. VAP precautions are in place.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has developed pulmonary edema, as evidenced by an extubated state and consistent findings on chest X-ray. Bipap support is given as needed, along with Lasix for volume overload.

4. Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to aggressive diuresis and hypernatremia.

5. Diarrhea: The patient developed diarrhea while on antibiotics. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out.

6. Hoarse Voice: The patient has a hoarse voice after traumatic intubation. The vocal cords are functional, and follow-up with ENT is"

 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin for planned 8 day
   course of MSSA VAP
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] and saturating well. Overall volume
   up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
   -Bipap as needed for pulmonary edema
   -Lasix prn for goal I/O negative 1-2 L
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   # Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues to have
   a hoarse voice.
   - ENT consult to eval vocal cords
   # EtOH abuse: hospitalized since [**10-12**]. No current signs of withdrawal,
   but patient is significantly sedated.
   - social work consult when MS improves
   # Fevers: known sources (pancreas/lung) as above.
   - continue to monitor
   # HTN: Likely [**12-17**] to pain and volume overload.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID, Hydralizine 40 q6 and increase
   Enaliprat.2.25 q6 to 5 q 6

   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**])
   - Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin for planned 8 day
   course of MSSA VAP to complete [**10-24**]
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] and saturating well. Overall volume
   up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
   -Bipap as needed
   -Lasix prn for goal I/O negative 1-2 L
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   # Diarrhea: Developed on antibx. Cdiff negative x 1
   - Repeat cdiff x 2
   # Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues to have
   a hoarse voice. ENT reports vocal cords functional and will continue to
   take time to recover.
   -f/u any further ENT reccs
   - f/u with ent in 2 wks
   #  Change in Mental Status: Pt significantly more drowsy this am.
   Likely [**12-17**] to Ativan received last night.
    -Hold Benzos for now
    - repeat ABG
    - reassess MS
   # EtOH abuse: hospitalized since [**10-12**]. No current signs of withdrawal,
   but patient is significantly sedated.
   - social work consult when MS improves
   # Fevers: known sources (pancreas/lung) as above.
   - continue to monitor
   # HTN: Likely [**12-17**] to pain and volume overload. Now off Nitro gtt.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID, Hydralizine 40 q6 and increase

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy, admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis. She is currently on day 8 of ICU stay. The patient has multiple medical complications including VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), pulmonary edema, diarrhea, hoarseness of voice, change in mental status, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. VAP: The patient has MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) as the causative organism for VAP. If not properly treated, it can lead to worsening respiratory status and sepsis.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may be due to fluid overload or cardiac issues. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory distress and potentially acute respiratory failure.
4. Diarrhea: The patient developed diarrhea while on antibiotics. If not evaluated and treated appropriately, it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hoarseness of Voice: The patient's hoarseness of voice is likely due to traumatic intubation. It is important to monitor and follow up with ENT recommendations for recovery.
6. Change in Mental Status: The patient's d"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of pancreatitis and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with an elevated heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. The patient is experiencing moderate respiratory distress and has diffuse rhonchi and coarse rales on lung auscultation. There is also evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by the elevated central venous pressure (CVP) and peripheral edema. The patient's laboratory results show hypernatremia, anemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Imaging reveals hyperinflation of the lungs with diffuse haziness, suggesting possible volume loss in the right upper lobe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and abnormal ABG values indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The presence of pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis and appropriate antibiotic therapy are required.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: Hypernatremia and fluid overload may contribute to acute kidney injury. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid balance are essential.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulable state increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued.
5. Pancreatitis Complications: Acute pancre"

   - Lost OG tube in the process of intubation; now holding tube feeds.
   - Was hypotensive; antihypertensives were held.  Weaned versed, but
   then hypertensive.  Started on propofol.
   - blood sugar 18 at 5am (pt recieved full dose lantus at night although
   no tube feeds)
   - Had high airway resistance overnight.  Respiratory suctioned out ""old

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is pancreatitis, but they have experienced several events during their stay in the ICU.

1. Tachycardia with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and subsequent acute hypotension, leading to the need for sedation for cardioversion and subsequent intubation. The patient is now back on the ventilator.

2. Nose bleed following re-intubation.

3. CT scan of the chest obtained; results pending, but there are apparent left upper lobe (LUL) interstitial markings and bilateral pleural effusions.

4. Lost oral-gastric (OG) tube during intubation; currently holding tube feeds.

5. Hypotensive episode, with antihypertensives being held. Initially, versed was weaned, but then hypertension occurred. Started on propofol.

6. Blood sugar of 18 at 5 am (patient received full dose lantus at night although no tube feeds).

7. High airway resistance overnight, requiring respiratory suctioning out ""old blood"" (~200 cc - check drain). High peak airway pressures; improved initially with suctioning, then needed decreased tidal volume (TV) to get peak pressure <30. Did not respond to albuterol.

   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**]). Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem was restarted given
   decompensating respitory status. Plan to complete 10 day course [**10-26**]
   - Continue Imipenem
   - VAP precautions
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx
   .
   # Respiratory/Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] but emergently
   re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with svt and hypotenstion. Overall
   volume up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema. CT chest with
   interstitial changes and pleural effusions.
   - Advance ET tube 2-3 cm
   - Propafol for sedation
   - Pt requires diuresis but goes into SVT with aggressive diuresis
   - Continue cautious diuresis with Lasix prn for goal 1

   negative
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs; Ipratropium MDI
   # SVTachycardia: Patient has prior h/o of Afib per pt while she was
   awake. Reportedly never anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear
   precipitated by  diuresis. Now in NSR. S/p cardioversion x2 yesterday,
   but pt spontaneously converted herself during code situation yesterday.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID
   # Alkalosis: Likely [**12-17**] aggressive diuresis. Also consistent with
   hypernatremia.
   # Diarrhea: Developed on antibx. Cdiff negative x 1
   - Repeat cdiff x 2
   # Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues to have
   a hoarse voice. ENT reports vocal cords functional and will continue to
   take time to recover.
   - f/u any further ENT reccs
   - f/u with ent in 2 wks
   # EtOH abuse: hospitalized since [**10-12**]. No current signs of withdrawal,
   but patient is significantly sedated.
   - social work consult when MS improves

She required emergent re-intubation due to hypotension and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, and her chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema. She has also been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Her laboratory results indicate jaundice, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated liver enzymes. She has been on aggressive diuresis, but this has led to hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis. She has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema increase the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilator management are necessary.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed VAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially systemic infection. Proper infection control measures and antibiotic therapy should be continued.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's fluid overload and use of aggressive diuresis may contribute to AKI. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid balance accordingly is important.
4. Sepsis: With the presence"

   24 Hour Events:
   - 4pm had tachycardia suspected to be a fib w/ RVR.  Became acutely
   hypotensive.  Was given sedation for cardioversion and subsequently
   required intubation.  Now back on the vent.
   - had nose bleed following re-intubation.
   - CT scan of the chest obtained; results pending, but there is apparent
   LUL intersitial markings and bilateral pleural effusions.
   - Lost OG tube in the process of intubation; now holding tube feeds.
   - Was hypotensive; antihypertensives were held.  Weaned versed, but
   then hypertensive.  Started on propofol.
   - blood sugar 18 at 5am (pt recieved full dose lantus at night although
   no tube feeds)
   - Had high airway resistance overnight.  Respiratory suctioned out ""old
   blood"" (~200cc- check drain). High peak airway pressures; improved
   initally with suctioning, then needed decreased TV to get peak Pressure
   <30.  Did not respond to albuterol.

 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem was restarted given
   decompensating respitory status. Plan to complete 10 day course [**10-26**]
   - Continue Imipenem
   - VAP precautions
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx
   .
   # Respiratory/Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] but emergently
   re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with svt and hypotenstion. Overall
   volume up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema. CT chest with
   interstitial changes and pleural effusions.
   - Advance ET tube 2-3 cm

   awake. Reportedly never anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear
   precipitated by  diuresis. Now in NSR. S/p cardioversion x2 yesterday,
   but pt spontaneously converted herself during code situation yesterday.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID; use lopressor 5 iv q6 while no OG
   tube
   # Anemia: Given patients need for Colloid [**Last Name (LF) 2740**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] transfuse
   1 U PRBC. Anemia is likely [**12-17**] to blood loss post traumatic intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy. She presented to the hospital with acute pancreatitis and has been in the ICU for 9 days. She was intubated emergently due to hypotension and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She developed a fever, and her WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection. She has been treated with antibiotics, but the infection has not improved. She also has pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on her chest X-ray and CT scan. Her blood pressure is unstable, and she requires continuous monitoring and support. She has a hoarse voice due to traumatic intubation, and her electrolytes are imbalanced. She has been diagnosed with pancreatitis and is receiving appropriate treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition may worsen, leading to complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis or infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. Infection: Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient's infection has not improved, indicating a potential drug-resistant organism or inadequate treatment. This could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Mechanical ventilation support may be necessary.
4. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and there is a risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure, pancreatitis, anemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone various interventions and treatments.

Key points from the note include:

1. The patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight.
2. Increased airway resistance was noted on the ventilator, and the patient was suctioned for what appeared to be old blood, resulting in improved pressures.
3. The patient remained in sinus rhythm through the night.
4. An episode of hypoglycemia occurred this morning, and glucose was given.
5. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down.
6. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and has been receiving antibiotics, including Nafcillin and Imipenem/Cilastatin.
7. The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including amiodarone, propofol, furosemide, hydromorphone, midazolam, metoprolol, and heparin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. The patient continues to receive amiodarone intravenously and maintains normal sinus rhythm. A bronchoscopy was performed, showing mild airway edema but no obstruction. The patient's ventilation settings were adjusted based on ABG results. A CT Chest revealed pulmonary edema, septal thickening, and a 2 cm right lower lobe nodule. Lasix was administered to address fluid balance. The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 21, but no transfusion was given. An OG tube was placed, and there are no planned surgical procedures. The patient is expected to be extubated in the morning after rounds, and acetazolamide may be used to correct alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular cultures of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage will be necessary to detect and treat any potential infection promptly.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. Monitoring urine output, maintaining fluid balance, and adjusting medications accordingly are crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
3. Pancreatitis complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to various complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy who presented with acute pancreatitis. She is now in the ICU on day 9. The patient had to be reintubated due to hypotension and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), pulmonary edema, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 123/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.7 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 35/50), slightly low albumin level (2.2 g/dL), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 494 IU/L. The patient also has hypernatremia (Na+: 146 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (K+: 3.0 mEq/L).

The patient's fluid balance is negative by 523 mL, and her urine output is stable. She has a history of alcohol abuse and has been hospitalized since October 12th.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including amiodarone, fentanyl, heparin, hyd"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy who presented with acute pancreatitis. She has been in the ICU for 9 days and experienced multiple medical complications. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, which is a serious condition that can lead to further complications such as infection, organ failure, and necrosis of the pancreas.

2. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, which is a common complication in critically ill patients. It is caused by bacteria that enter the lungs through the endotracheal tube.

3. Respiratory/Pulmonary edema: The patient has signs of pulmonary edema, as indicated by her CT chest showing interstitial changes and pleural effusions. This can be a result of fluid overload or heart failure.

4. SVTachycardia (Supraventricular Tachycardia): The patient has had episodes of SVT, which is an abnormal heart rhythm originating above the ventricles. It can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. This can be caused by blood loss, inadequate production of red blood cells, or destruction of red blood cells.

6. Alkalosis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. They are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance has been negative over the past 24 hours, resulting in an increased hematocrit level. They remain febrile and continue to be hypokalemic despite repletion. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and experienced a rash after taking antibiotics. They are currently receiving multiple infusions, including propofol, amiodarone, furosemide, hydralazine, metoprolol, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

24-hour events include a stool culture, bronchoscopy, and fever. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Their vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 118/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.56, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 313. 

Physical examination findings include a well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and no signs of edema or cyanosis. Cardiovascular examination reveals a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), S1 and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. The patient has been intubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilator mode with a nasal cannula for respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/54 mmHg to 163/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of rhonchi and end expiratory wheezes in the lung fields.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications, which has been documented. The last doses of antibiotics given were Nafcillin on October 23rd and Imipenem/Cilastatin on October 26th. The patient is currently receiving amiodarone infusion at a rate of 0.5 mg/min and other ICU medications including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), hydralazine, and metoprolol.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a positive fluid balance of 893 mL and a total output of 2,165 mL since midnight. The patient's blood products and urine output are within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a slightly elevated pH level of 7.53 and"

   - f/u surgery and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**]). Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem was restarted given
   decompensating respitory status. Plan to complete 14 day course [**10-30**]
   - Continue Imipenem
   - VAP precautions
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx
   .
   # Respiratory/Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] but emergently
   re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with svt and hypotenstion. Patient was
   extubated [**10-25**]. Overall volume up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema. CT chest with interstitial changes and pleural effusions. Now
   doing well on minimal vent. Settings. Bronchoscopy [**10-17**] wnl, and
   samples significant only for 2+ polys and staph aureus. Continues to
   diurese well to lasix prn.
   - Continue cautious diuresis with Lasix prn for goal 500 cc - 1  L net
   negative
   - Pt dislikes neb tx so will placed them on hold for now and restart if
   pt decompensates
   - Consider nononvasive ventilation if needed
   # SVTachycardia: Patient has prior h/o of Afib per pt while she was
   awake. Reportedly never anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear
   precipitated by  diuresis. Now in NSR. S/p cardioversion x2 [**10-23**], but
   pt spontaneously converted herself during code situation yesterday.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt until able to take po. Then start 400 mg po
   TID x7 days (recalculate 10 g total loading dose)
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID; use lopressor 5 iv q6 while no OG
   tube
   - Plan for CT PA to r/o PE
   # Heart murmur : New heart murmur noted on exam by Attending. [**12-21**]
   diastolic RLSB.
   - repeat tte
   # LLE Swelling: LLE swelling worse than Right side
   - LENIS to eval for dvt
   # Anemia: No indication for transfusion today.
   # Alkalosis: Likely [**12-17**] aggressive diuresis. Also consistent with
   hypernatremia. No plan to use acetazolmide for now.
   - replete Kcl
   # Diarrhea: Developed on antibx. Cdiff negative x3. Continue volume
   repletion for approriate UOP.
   # Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues to have
   a hoarse voice. ENT reports vocal cords functional and will continue to
   take time to recover.
   - f/u any further ENT reccs
   - f/u with ent in 2 wks
   # EtOH abuse: hospitalized since [**10-12**]. No current signs of withdrawal,
   but patient is significantly sedated.
   - social work consult when MS improves
   # HTN: Likely [**12-17**] to pain and volume overload. Now off Nitro gtt.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID, Hydralizine 40 q6 and increase
   Enaliprat. 5 q 6
   - lasix prn (see above)
   - d/c clonidine
   - holding home HCTZ given pancreatitis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy. She presented to the ICU with acute pancreatitis and has been admitted for 11 days. The patient was re-intubated due to hypotension and respiratory distress. She has been extubated twice but required emergent re-intubation on day 10. The patient's condition has been complicated by volume overload, pulmonary edema, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (SVT), and peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient continues to have significant volume overload, and there is a concern for ongoing fluid sequestration. Monitoring for signs of worsening pancreatitis and fluid accumulation is necessary.
2. VAP: The patient has shown improvement with appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, continued monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and ensuring adherence to VAP precautions is essential.
3. Respiratory/Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema appears to be responding well to diuretic therapy. Close monitoring for signs of fluid overload or worsening respiratory status is required.
4. SVT/AFib: The patient's episodes of SVT seem to be precipitated by diuresis. It is crucial to continue amiodarone infusion and plan for cardioversion if necessary. Metoprolol can be continued as well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy who presented with acute pancreatitis. She has been in the ICU for 119 days and has had multiple complications including respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary edema, supraventricular tachycardia, anemia, metabolic alkalosis, diarrhea, hoarse voice, ethanol abuse, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and fluid overload. The patient is currently intubated and on minimal ventilatory support. She is also receiving various medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to previous episodes of pulmonary edema and VAP. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if appropriate measures are not taken.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has chronic pancreatitis with evidence of peripancreatic phlegmon on CT scan. There is a risk of further complications such as necrosis or infection of the pancreas.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may be exacerbated by pain and fluid overload. Proper management is necessary to prevent complications like heart failure or stroke.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy. Inadequate control of blood sugar levels can lead to complications like diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.

5. Fluid overload: The patient has"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute pancreatitis and is now on day 11 in the ICU. She has been intubated twice due to respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient's current conditions include pancreatitis with peripancreatic phlegmon, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary edema, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), anemia, metabolic alkalosis, diarrhea (possibly Clostridium difficile), hoarse voice (likely due to traumatic intubation), ethanol abuse, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pancreatitis with peripancreatic phlegmon: There is a risk of infection and abscess formation due to the presence of necrotic tissue.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of infection with MSSA, which may require aggressive treatment to prevent further complications.
3. Pulmonary edema: This condition needs to be closely monitored, as it can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
4. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and episodes of SVT should be closely monitored, and appropriate antiarrhythmic medications should be continued.
5. Anemia: It is important to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and consider blood transf"

   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**]). Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem was restarted given
   decompensating respitory status. Plan to complete 10 day course [**10-26**]
   - Continue Imipenem
   - VAP precautions
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx

   # Respiratory/Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] but emergently
   re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with svt and hypotenstion. Patient was
   extubated [**10-25**]. Overall volume up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema. CT chest with interstitial changes and pleural effusions. Now
   doing well on minimal vent. Settings. Bronchoscopy [**10-17**] wnl, and
   samples significant only for 2+ polys and staph aureus. Continues to
   diurese well to lasix prn.

   precipitated by  diuresis. Now in NSR. S/p cardioversion x2 [**10-23**], but
   pt spontaneously converted herself during code situation yesterday.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt until able to take po. Then start 400 mg po
   TID x7 days (recalculate 10 g total loading dose)
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID; use lopressor 5 iv q6 while no OG
   tube

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and post-cholecystectomy who presented with acute pancreatitis. She is now on day 11 in the ICU. The patient underwent emergent re-intubation due to hypotension and respiratory failure. She was initially extubated but required re-intubation during an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and hypotension. The patient is currently extubated and doing well on minimal ventilator settings.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with a CT scan showing peripancreatic phlegmon. She is jaundiced and has significant volume overload, possibly due to aggressive resuscitation.
2. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. The sputum culture grew MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus), and she is currently being treated with imipenem. The plan is to complete a 10-day course of imipenem.
3. Respiratory/Pulmonary edema: The patient had pulmonary edema as evidenced by chest X-ray and CT chest with interstitial changes and pleural effusions. She is diuresing well with lasix prn.
4. SVTachycardia: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy, presenting with acute pancreatitis. She has been in the ICU for 11 days. The patient was reintubated on 10/23 due to hypotension and respiratory failure. She was extubated on 10/25. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions including VAP, pulmonary edema, SVT, anemia, alkalosis, diarrhea, hoarse voice, alcohol abuse, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and fluid-electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient continues to have significant volume overload and ongoing fluid-electrolyte imbalance. This can lead to further complications such as kidney dysfunction or cardiac issues.
2. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA (Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infection. If not treated appropriately, it can lead to worsening respiratory status and systemic infection.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen due to ongoing fluid overload. This can result in decreased oxygenation and respiratory distress.
4. SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia): The patient's episodes of SVT may recur, leading to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Anemia: The patient's an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis. The patient is currently extubated and on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. He is receiving continuous amiodarone infusion for arrhythmia prophylaxis. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and a medical history of hypertension. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of rhonchi and end expiratory wheezes, which have improved on the chest X-ray. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/54 to 163/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1,362 mL and output of 2,165 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 893 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 335 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.53, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 103 mmHg, and HCO3- of 36 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals the absence of peripheral vascular and neurologic assessments. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 120 mg/dL, and increased lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's problems include acute pain, hypertension, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute pancreatitis, and altered mental status. The patient requires continued ICU care, including pain control, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of acute pancreatitis, development of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, and cardiac complications due to hypertension. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status will be necessary to promptly identify and manage any complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presented from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis; now ICU day 12. Re-intubated emergently [**10-23**] in the
   setting of hypotension to sbp 60s a fib with RVR to 200s s/p
   cardioversion, and extubated [**10-25**].
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis:  CT essentially unchanged; identification of
   peripancreatic phlegmon. Continues to be jaundiced.  Significant volume
   overload given aggressive resuscitation; UOP is stable.  WBC trending
   down.   GI following.  LFts continue to trend down.
   -Per surgery, no need to cover with antibx for necrotic pancreas
   - Plan to advance diet to clear liquids pending s and s consult
   - f/u surgery and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive) [**10-15**] (sputum) and [**10-17**] (bal). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**]).
   Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem
   was restarted given decompensating respitory status. CT chest [**10-26**]
   concerning for worsening multifocal pna, so changed antibx coverage
   [**10-26**] from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn. Micro data negative since [**10-17**].
   Plan to complete 14 day course [**10-30**]
   - Vanco/Zosyn
   - VAP precautions
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx
   .
   # Respiratory/Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] but emergently
   re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with svt and hypotenstion. Patient was
   extubated [**10-25**]. Overall volume up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema. CT chest with interstitial changes and pleural effusions. Now
   doing well on minimal vent. Settings. Bronchoscopy [**10-17**] wnl, and
   samples significant only for 2+ polys and staph aureus. Continues to
   diurese well to lasix prn.
   - Continue cautious diuresis with Lasix prn for goal 500 cc - 1  L net
   negative
   - Pt dislikes neb tx so will placed them on hold for now and restart if
   pt decompensates
   - Consider nononvasive ventilation if needed
   # SVTachycardia: Patient has prior h/o of Afib per pt while she was
   awake. Reportedly never anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear
   precipitated by  diuresis. Now in NSR. S/p cardioversion x2 [**10-23**], but
   pt spontaneously converted herself during code situation yesterday. CTA
   negative for PE
   - Received approximatedly 2.5 g Iv Amiodarone. Plan to continue 400 mg
   po TID x4 days until [**10-31**] to complete 10 g load before starting
   maintenance dose
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID
   # HTN:
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID, Hydralizine 40 q6 and Enaliprat. 5
   q 6
   - lasix prn (see above)
   - holding home HCTZ given pancreatitis
   - A line for pressure monitoring
   # LLE Swelling: LLE swelling worse than Right side. LENI negative.
   # Alkalosis: Likely [**12-17**] aggressive diuresis. Also consistent with
   hypernatremia. No plan to use acetazolmide for now.
   - replete Kcl
   # Diarrhea: Developed on antibx. Cdiff negative x3. Continue volume
   repletion for approriate UOP.
   - Loperamide prn
   # Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues to have
   a hoarse voice. ENT reports vocal cords functional and will continue to
   take time to recover.
   - f/u any further ENT reccs
   - f/u with ent in 2 wks
   # EtOH abuse: hospitalized since [**10-12**]. No current signs of withdrawal,
   but patient is significantly sedated.
   - social work consult when MS improves
   # Hyperglycemia:  Continue iss and calculate needs x 24 hrs
   # RLL nodule
 needs f/u as outpt

   pancreatitis; now ICU day 12. Re-intubated emergently [**10-23**] in the
   setting of hypotension to sbp 60s a fib with RVR to 200s s/p
   cardioversion, and extubated [**10-25**].
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis:  CT essentially unchanged; identification of
   peripancreatic phlegmon. Continues to be jaundiced.  Significant volume
   overload given aggressive resuscitation; UOP is stable.  WBC trending
   down.   GI following.  LFts continue to trend down.
   -Per surgery, no need to cover with antibx for necrotic pancreas
   - Plan to advance diet to full liquids today
   - Will d/w GI re: pancreatic enzyme replacement
   - Contininue Insulin gtt (see below)
   - f/u surgery and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive) [**10-15**] (sputum) and [**10-17**] (bal). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**]).
   Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem
   was restarted given decompensating respitory status. CT chest [**10-26**]
   concerning for worsening multifocal pna, so changed antibx coverage
   [**10-26**] from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn. Micro data negative since [**10-17**].
   Plan to complete 14 day course [**10-30**]
   - Vanco/Zosyn
   - VAP precautions
   - add Guaifenesin for expectoration
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx

   # Respiratory/Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] but emergently
   re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with svt and hypotenstion. Patient was
   extubated [**10-25**]. Overall volume up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema. CT chest with interstitial changes and pleural effusions. Now
   doing well on minimal vent. Settings. Bronchoscopy [**10-17**] wnl, and
   samples significant only for 2+ polys and staph aureus. Continues to
   diurese well to lasix prn.
   - Continue cautious diuresis with Lasix prn for goal 500 cc - 1  L net
   negative
   - Pt dislikes neb tx so will placed them on hold for now and restart if
   pt decompensates
   - Consider nononvasive ventilation if needed
   # SVTachycardia: Patient has prior h/o of Afib per pt while she was
   awake. Reportedly never anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear
   precipitated by  diuresis. Now in NSR. S/p cardioversion x2 [**10-23**], but
   pt spontaneously converted herself during code situation yesterday. CTA
   negative for PE
   - Received approximatedly 2.5 g Iv Amiodarone. Plan to continue 400 mg

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2564**] above,
   and I agree with the findings and plan of care.  The patient
   pancreatitis is resolving and her diet being advanced.  She is on face
   mask and still having some trouble expectorating sputum following her
   multifocal pneumonia and ARDS.  We will continue Vanc and Zosyn for 14
   days, try to not dry her out too quickly (given  her secretions and
   alkalosis), and we will use albuterol nebs and guaifensin to help her
   mobilize her sputum.  Hopefully she will remain extubated and
   cardiovascularly stable as she is on Amio and doing well.
   Time spent in the care of this complex and critically ill patient: 40

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy, who presented to the ICU with acute pancreatitis. She has been in the ICU for 12 days and has had multiple complications, including respiratory issues, infection, and fluid overload. The patient is currently extubated but still has difficulty expectorating sputum due to multifocal pneumonia and ARDS. Her pancreatitis is resolving, and her diet is being advanced. She is on a face mask to help with respiration and is receiving medications to aid in mobilizing her sputum. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to the ongoing difficulty in expectorating sputum following her multifocal pneumonia and ARDS. There is a risk of further respiratory distress or the development of new pulmonary infections.
2. Infection: The patient has shown signs of infection, specifically with MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus). It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has significant volume overload, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema and worsening of respiratory status. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis is essential.
4. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatitis is resolving, there is still a risk of complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia, acute pancreatitis, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and has undergone several imaging tests, including a CTA which showed no pulmonary embolism but indicated worsening in multifocal consolidations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust antibiotic therapy if necessary.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest acute pancreatitis. Monitoring of abdominal pain and pancreatic enzyme levels should be done regularly to assess the severity and progress of the condition.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may increase the risk of delirium. Regular neurologic assessments and interventions to optimize sleep, pain control, and sensory stimulation are necessary.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the CTA did not show any pulmonary embolism, there is still a risk of DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Regular lower"

 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem
   was restarted given decompensating respitory status. CT chest [**10-26**]
   concerning for worsening multifocal pna, so changed antibx coverage
   [**10-26**] from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn. Micro data negative since [**10-17**].
   Plan to complete 14 day course [**10-30**]
   - Vanco/Zosyn
   - VAP precautions
   - add Guaifenesin for expectoration
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx
   .
   # Respiratory/Pulmonary edema:  Extubated [**10-21**] but emergently
   re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with svt and hypotenstion. Patient was
   extubated [**10-25**]. Overall volume up, and CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema. CT chest with interstitial changes and pleural effusions.
   Bronchoscopy [**10-17**] wnl, and samples significant only for 2+ polys and
   staph aureus. Continues to  diurese well to lasix prn.
   - Continue cautious diuresis with Lasix prn for goal 500 cc - 1  L net
   negative
   - Pt dislikes neb tx so will placed them on hold for now and restart if
   pt decompensates
   - Consider nononvasive ventilation if needed
   # SVTachycardia: Patient has prior h/o of Afib per pt while she was
   awake. Reportedly never anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear
   precipitated by  diuresis. Now in NSR. S/p cardioversion x2 [**10-23**], but
   pt spontaneously converted herself during code situation last week. CTA
   negative for PE
   - Plan to continue Amiodarone 400 mg po TID x4 days until [**10-31**] to
   complete 10 g load before starting maintenance dose
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID
   # HTN:
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg po BID, Hydralizine 40 q6 and Enaliprat. 5
   q 6
   - lasix prn (see above)
   - holding home HCTZ given pancreatitis
   - A line for pressure monitoring
   # LLE Swelling: LLE swelling worse than Right side. LENI negative.
   # Alkalosis: Likely [**12-17**] aggressive diuresis. Also consistent with
   earlier hypernatremia (which as improved today). No plan to use
   acetazolmide for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy, admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis.
- She presented with hypotension and required emergent re-intubation due to respiratory failure.
- The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and is currently receiving treatment with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
- She also has pulmonary edema, as evidenced by chest X-ray and CT scan, which is being managed with diuretics.
- The patient experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was cardioverted twice. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm.
- She has a history of atrial fibrillation but has never been anticoagulated.
- The patient's hypertension is being managed with metoprolol, hydralazine, and enalapril.
- She has significant peripheral edema in her lower extremities.
- The patient developed diarrhea while on antibiotics, but tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) have been negative.
- She is experiencing anxiety and is being treated with Ativan as needed.
- The patient has a hoarse voice likely due to traumatic intubation, and her vocal cords are functional.
- Her blood glucose levels are elevated, and she is receiving insulin therapy.
- She has a right lower lobe nodule that needs further evaluation.
- The patient is a chronic alcoholic and has been hospitalized since October 12th without current signs of withdrawal.
- She has been advanced to regular diet and is being repleted with electrolytes as needed.
- The patient's family is expected to visit today, and her significant other and brother have been notified.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already being treated for VAP with antibiotics, but there is a risk of progression or development of multidrug-resistant organisms.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if fluid overload is not managed appropriately.
3. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension could lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Peripheral edema: If left untreated, it could progress and lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Diarrhea: Although C. diff has been ruled out, the patient may develop antibiotic-associated diarrhea or other gastrointestinal infections.
6. Hyperglycemia: Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and other complications.
7. Hoarse voice: The patient may continue to experience a hoarse voice, potentially affecting her ability to communicate effectively.
8. Alcohol withdrawal: Although not currently exhibiting signs of withdrawal, the patient's chronic alcoholism puts her at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome upon discontinuation of alcohol intake.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2859**] above
   and agree with the findings and plan of care.
   Patient is now 3+ days post 2^nd extubation and appears to be holding
   her own.  She is coughing and largely swallowing sputum.  CXR still
   shows some volume loss in upper lung fields and exam shows scattered
   rhonchi and wheezes.  To aid in mucociliary clearance we will encourage
   her to cough, use an Acapella mucus clearance device, and we
ll hold
   diuresis for a day or two.  Clinically she doesn
t seem intravascularly
   wet, and may be dry.  Her BP is low ish today and we
ll respond by
   curtailing some of her antihypertensives and advancing diet.  She had
   GPR in blood cult today, and hence additional bld cx will be obtained,
   while she remains on Vanco/Zosyn.  If she continues to do well, we hope
   to call her out in next 24 -48 hrs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and recent cholecystectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis and experienced several complications during her stay. The patient presented with hypotension, required cardioversion, and was intubated twice due to respiratory failure. She also had an episode of ventricular tachycardia and was treated with amiodarone. The patient's arterial line stopped functioning, and she developed pulmonary edema with pleural effusions. Her blood cultures grew gram-positive rods, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The patient was treated with various antibiotics, including imipenem, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. She also developed diarrhea, which was initially attributed to antibiotic use but was later ruled out as Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's mental status improved, and she was extubated on the 25th. She is now tolerating a full diet and showing signs of improvement. However, she continues to have significant extra-vascular volume overload in her lower extremities and is still experiencing some respiratory issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum cultures showed significant growth of gram-positive cocci, and she was initially treated with imipenem. Subsequently, her antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobact"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain, fever, known hypertension, and recent extubation. She has been experiencing altered mental status, pneumonia (ventilator-acquired), acute pancreatitis, and pain. The patient's fever has diminished, and leukocytosis has resolved. Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, but there is no evidence of epidural abscess on preliminary reads of the MRI total spine. The patient's home psych medications have been restarted, and she is receiving Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole for infection. She also has observed aspiration, hypertension, back pain (MRI preliminary negative for abscess), a chronic candidal infection being treated as an outpatient, diabetes (half home dose given at the hospital), hypothyroidism, skin rash (chronic venous stasis with possible contact dermatitis), hyperlipidemia, and is on prophylaxis with Lansoprazole and heparin. The patient is starting tube feeds today and will have daily lytes with PRN repletion. The ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is still pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. This can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with respiratory failure and pancreatitis. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized, and he is doing well off the ventilator with acceptable oxygen saturation on nasal supplemental oxygen. He has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and has received various antibiotics, including imipenem/cilastatin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mild respiratory distress. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/42 to 116/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, overweight with mild respiratory distress. Laboratory results show normal levels for hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and his amylase and lipase levels are normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications like"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. The patient is on inhalers and has a known allergy to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), resulting in a rash. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/42 mmHg to 120/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid intake of 1,645 mL, with outputs including 856 mL of urine, 975 mL of IV fluids, and 166 mL of blood products. There is a negative fluid balance of 1,920 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an ABG result of ///33/. Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, and pulses.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, amylase/lipase, lactic acid, LDH, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, and potassium levels.

The patient's assessment includes pain control, hypertension, pneumonia (ventilator acquired), acute pancreatitis, altered mental status, and other problems mentioned in the comments section. The ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and VAP precautions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pancreatitis, development of infections due to prolonged ICU stay and ventilator use, potential bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy, and possible fluid imbalance."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presented from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis; now ICU day 15. Re-intubated emergently [**10-23**] in the
   setting of hypotension to sbp 60s a fib with RVR to 200s s/p
   cardioversion, and extubated [**10-25**]. Now much brighter and ?approaching
   end of ICU stay.
   # Pancreatitis:   Jaundice is improving. Tolerating new diet well.
   Overall much improved.  Continues with significant extra-vascular
   volume overload in LE's given earlier aggressive resuscitation; UOP is
   stable.  WBC trending down.   GI following.
   -Per surgery, no need to cover with antibx for necrotic pancrease.
   - Continue full diet.
   -F/u stool fat [**Doctor Last Name 2886**] to determine if there is a need for pancreatic
   enzymes
   - Plan for ISS and basal lantus today
   - f/u surgery and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive) [**10-15**] (sputum) and [**10-17**] (bal). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**]).
   Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem
   was restarted given decompensating respitory status. CT chest [**10-26**]
   concerning for worsening multifocal pna, so changed antibx coverage
   [**10-26**] from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn. Micro data negative since [**10-17**].
   Plan to complete 14 day course [**10-30**].  She is coughing and largely
   swallowing sputum.  CXR still shows some volume loss in upper lung
   fields and exam shows scattered rhonchi and wheezes.
   -encourage her to cough,  mucus clearance device.
   - Vanco/Zosyn to be completed today
   - VAP precautions
   - con't Guaifenesin for expectoration
   - resent blood, sputum, urine cx

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and a previous cholecystectomy who presented with acute pancreatitis. She is now on day 15 in the ICU and has had several medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient initially presented with acute pancreatitis. Although her condition has improved, she still has significant extra-vascular volume overload in her lower extremities due to aggressive resuscitation. There is also mention of jaundice improvement and tolerance of a new diet.

2. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient developed sputum growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and MSSA on [10-15]. Initially, vancomycin was discontinued due to its potential nephrotoxicity. Imipenem was restarted because of the patient's decompensating respiratory status. However, the patient's respiratory status worsened, and she developed multifocal pneumonia on CT chest. As a result, antibiotic coverage was changed from imipenem to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Micro data has been negative since [10-17]. The plan is to complete a 14-day course of antibiotics by [10-30]. The patient is currently coughing and largely swallowing sputum.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of alcoholism
   and s/p cholecystectomy who presented from an OSH with acute
   pancreatitis; now ICU day 13. Re-intubated emergently [**10-23**] in the
   setting of hypotension to sbp 60s a fib with RVR to 200s s/p
   cardioversion, and extubated [**10-25**]. Now much brighter and ?approaching
   end of ICU stay.
   # Pancreatitis:   Jaundice is improving. Tolerating new diet well.
   Overall much improved.  Continues with significant extra-vascular
   volume overload in LE's given earlier aggressive resuscitation; UOP is
   stable.  WBC trending down.   GI following.
   -Per surgery, no need to cover with antibx for necrotic pancrease.
   - Continue full diet.
   -F/u stool fat [**Doctor Last Name 2886**] to determine if there is a need for pancreatic
   enzymes
   - Originally planned to dose Insulin today, but have just completed
   first day of full regulars, so will calculate today's requirements
   based on insulin drip on fulls.
   - f/u surgery and GI recs (Brown)
   # VAP: Sputum GS significant GPCs  [**10-15**]. Growing MSSA (imipenem
   sensitive) [**10-15**] (sputum) and [**10-17**] (bal). Vancomycin d/cd ([**Date range (1) 2691**]).
   Transition from Imipenem (12/2
 [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin [**10-22**], but Imipenem
   was restarted given decompensating respitory status. CT chest [**10-26**]
   concerning for worsening multifocal pna, so changed antibx coverage
   [**10-26**] from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn. Micro data negative since [**10-17**].
   Plan to complete 14 day course [**10-30**].  She is coughing and largely
   swallowing sputum.  CXR still shows some volume loss in upper lung
   fields and exam shows scattered rhonchi and wheezes.
   -encourage her to cough,  Acapella mucus clearance device.
   - Vanco/Zosyn
   - VAP precautions
   - con't Guaifenesin for expectoration

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of alcoholism and previous cholecystectomy, who presented with acute pancreatitis and is currently on ICU day 15. She has been through multiple complications including re-intubation due to hypotension and respiratory failure, suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation. She has also shown signs of volume overload in her lower extremities and has had episodes of diarrhea and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. It is caused by bacteria that normally reside in the upper respiratory tract and can infect the lungs in individuals with weakened immune systems or who have spent prolonged periods on a ventilator.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray and CT scan have shown evidence of pulmonary edema, which is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to difficulty breathing and decreased oxygenation.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chamber of the heart beats irregularly and often faster than normal. This can lead to poor blood flow and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.

4. Lower extremity edema: The patient is experiencing significant pitting ed"

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient has respiratory failure and pneumonia, with atrial fibrillation (afib).
- The patient's fluid balance is negative by 2 liters.
- The patient is afebrile and has good oxygen saturation on supplemental oxygen.
- The patient has completed courses of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is no longer on them.
- The patient's mental status has normalized.
- The patient has acute pancreatitis but is improving.
- The patient has hypertension, but it is benign.
- The patient has persistent upper lobe opacities on chest X-ray with volume loss.
- The patient's pain, altered mental status, and afib are being managed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient has already completed a course of antibiotics for this condition, but monitoring for any signs of infection or worsening respiratory symptoms is essential.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or systemic inflammation.
3. Atrial fibrillation (afib): The patient has afib, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events. Monitoring the patient's cardiac status and anticoagulation therapy is necessary.
4. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is described as benign,"
