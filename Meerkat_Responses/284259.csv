","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and a right below-knee amputation. He presented to the emergency room with sepsis and was transferred to the ICU. The patient has a history of cellulitis, diarrhea, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes. His current problems include hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, cellulitis, diarrhea, and cardiogenic shock.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock with a probable source being a stump infection. Hemodynamic monitoring shows low mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the goal is to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) greater than 12, check mixed venous oxygen saturation (SCVO2), and administer a 500cc bolus to assess fluid responsiveness. Trend lactate levels. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated, and a consultation with vascular surgery (Pomposelli) should be sought.

2. Vtach: The patient's ventricular tachycardia is being managed with a lidocaine drip. Pressor support should be weaned as tolerated, and an electrocardiogram (EP) consultation is appreciated.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: Advance slowly
- Glycemic control: Use sliding scale insulin (SSRI)
- Lines: 18-gauge and 20-gauge inserted on 09/25/2131 at 09:15 PM, multi-lumen inserted on 09/26/2131 at 12:00 AM.
- Prophylaxis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer with an H2 blocker.
- Communication: Code status is full code.
- Disposition: ICU.
- Total time spent: [Not mentioned].

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of cellulitis and is currently suspected to have a stump infection, which could lead to further complications such as sepsis or spread of infection.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's ischemic cardiomyopathy and current presentation with hypotension and low MAP indicate the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which can worsen without appropriate management.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's recent onset of diarrhea may be related to antibiotic use, Clostridium difficile infection, or another underlying condition. It should be monitored and treated accordingly.
4. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia need close monitoring and management, as it can be life-threatening if not properly addressed.
5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance is currently positive, indicating fluid overload. This should be carefully managed to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or acute kidney injury.
6. Glycemic control: With the patient's diabetes and current critical condition, tight glycemic control is essential to prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia-related complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and a history of right below-knee amputation. He presented with sepsis from a stump infection. The patient was initially hypotensive and developed ventricular tachycardia (VT) but responded to treatment with lidocaine and phenylephrine. He has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being closely monitored for any complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is at risk of ongoing shock due to sepsis. The healthcare team should continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and monitor hemodynamics closely. The source of infection appears to be the stump wound, so appropriate wound care and debridement should be considered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and the possibility of Clostridium difficile infection should be kept in mind.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has already experienced an episode of VT and was successfully managed with lidocaine. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and consider further antiarrhythmic treatment if necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine levels is warranted. Adjustments to medication dosages based on renal function should be made as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o M with PMH of DM type 2, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and PVD s/p R
   BKA admitted with diarrhea, hypotension and elevated WBC consistent
   with sepsis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: Improved on 1.1 phenylphrine overnight. Known EF 20%.
   MAPs in the 70s. SBP 90 - 110s.
   - Will get CVP transduced via L IJ
   - Asses Scv02 to determine cardiogenic vs septic etiology of patient
   hypotension.
   - Will provide IVF pending above results and follow with clinical
   exams.
   # Infectious Source: Skin/Soft Tissue vs C. Diff. Patients WBC is
   elevated in setting of run of VT overnight so difficult to base
   response to antibiotics this AM with WBC going from 20 -> 30K.
   -  Follow-UP blood cultures, urine cultures, stool for c. diff
   - Will fluid resuscitate, but gently given poor EF.
   - Continue broad spectrum ABX with Zosyn/vancomycin while cultures
   pending
   - Touch base with patients vascular surgeon for evaluation.
   - Cont Vanco PO  for possible C. Diff given loose stools, F/U culture
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Per EP this morning patients episode of last
   night was VT from likely same site as prior episodes.
   - Continue Lidocaine drip for 24hrs
   - Restart Amiodarone 200 PO Daily
   - Tomorrow will begin Mexilitine 150mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - To be assessed by EP team tomorrow for potential ICD implantation.
    - EP to evaluate in morning - may need ICD implantation
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: Holding BP medications in setting of
   hypotension.
   - Cautious IVF
   - pressor support as needed (with phenylephrine, avoiding dobutamine
   given past adverse reactions).
   - telemetry
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Cr. 1.7 today at baseline.
   - Continue to  monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Diabetes:
    Continue home dose NPH, ISS.
   .
   # Hypercoagulability:
   - Curently holding lovenox however will likely restart this PM
   following discussion with other servicees at to whether pt will need to
   go to other procedures in the immediate future
   .
   # Depression:
   - Cont Citalopram.
   .
   # Neuropathy: Oxycontin, neurontin, Vicodin.
   .
   # PPX: Holding lovenox as above, will restart, pneumoboots.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes type 2, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted with diarrhea, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count consistent with sepsis. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/63 mmHg to 110/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is being ventilated with a nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include dilated pupils, distant heart sounds, absent peripheral pulses, soft and non-tender abdomen, muscle wasting, and mild redness at the right below-knee amputation site.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (31.7 K/uL), hemoglobin (13.3 g/dL), creatinine (1.7 mg/dL), and potassium (5.1 mEq/L). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin) and phenylephrine for hemodynamic support. The plan is to continue IV fluids pending further assessment and follow up with clinical exams. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and stool for Clostridium difficile have been ordered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and oliguria. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, but he developed hypotension and oliguria within 24 hours. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin). The patient also received dopamine for hemodynamic support and ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Enoxaparin was administered for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. 

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been relatively stable. The patient's renal function has declined as evidenced by the increase in serum creatinine and BUN. 

The patient's fluid balance has been positive over the past 24 hours with an intake of 1,784 mL and output of 2,049 mL. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is low at 0 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, and his ABG shows a slightly elevated PaCO2 level.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to the lack of assessment in several areas such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o M with PMH of DM type 2, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and PVD s/p R
   BKA admitted with diarrhea, hypotension and elevated WBC consistent
   with sepsis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: Improved on 1.1 phenylphrine overnight. Known EF 20%.
   MAPs in the 70s. SBP 90 - 110s.
   - Will get CVP transduced via L IJ
   - Asses Scv02 to determine cardiogenic vs septic etiology of patient
   hypotension.
   - Will provide IVF pending above results and follow with clinical
   exams.
   # Infectious Source: Skin/Soft Tissue vs C. Diff. Patients WBC is
   elevated in setting of run of VT overnight so difficult to base
   response to antibiotics this AM with WBC going from 20 -> 30K.
   -  Follow-UP blood cultures, urine cultures, stool for c. diff
   - Will fluid resuscitate, but gently given poor EF.
   - Continue broad spectrum ABX with Zosyn/vancomycin while cultures
   pending
   - Touch base with patients vascular surgeon for evaluation.
   - Cont Vanco PO  for possible C. Diff given loose stools, F/U culture
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Per EP this morning patients episode of last
   night was VT from likely same site as prior episodes.
   - Continue Lidocaine drip for 24hrs
   - Restart Amiodarone 200 PO Daily
   - Tomorrow will begin Mexilitine 150mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - To be assessed by EP team tomorrow for potential ICD implantation.
    - EP to evaluate in morning - may need ICD implantation
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: Holding BP medications in setting of
   hypotension.
   - Cautious IVF
   - pressor support as needed (with phenylephrine, avoiding dobutamine
   given past adverse reactions).
   - telemetry
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Cr. 1.7 today at baseline.
   - Continue to  monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Diabetes:
    Continue home dose NPH, ISS.
   .
   # Hypercoagulability:
   - Curently holding lovenox however will likely restart this PM
   following discussion with other servicees at to whether pt will need to
   go to other procedures in the immediate future
   .
   # Depression:
   - Cont Citalopram.
   .
   # Neuropathy: Oxycontin, neurontin, Vicodin.
   .
   # PPX: Holding lovenox as above, will restart, pneumoboots.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease who underwent right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with symptoms of diarrhea, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count, consistent with sepsis. The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the use of phenylephrine, and his mean arterial pressure (MAP) is in the 70s. The patient's heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and symptoms of diarrhea and hypotension suggest an ongoing infection that may lead to sepsis. Immediate attention should be given to managing the infection through appropriate antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced an episode of VT overnight, which was confirmed by the electrophysiology (EP) team. The patient is currently on lidocaine drip and restarting amiodarone. Further evaluation by the EP team is recommended for potential implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
3. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient's ischemic cardiomyopathy may contribute to his current hemodynamic instability. Holding beta-blockers due to hypotension is appropriate, but close monitoring and cautious fluid management are necessary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has several medical conditions including diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic right-sided transudative effusion (cardiogenic), polycythemia, and cardiomyopathy. He also has a history of right below-knee amputation (R BKA) and left foot wound.

The patient presented to the emergency room with drainage from his right stump and diarrhea. He was given vancomycin (Vanco) and then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypotension. In the ICU, he developed sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was started on lidocaine. The VT eventually broke, and the patient was placed on neosynephrine.

The patient's current problems include hypotension, VT, cellulitis, diarrhea, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), cardiomyopathy, and DM. The likely source of sepsis is the stump infection. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but his CVP is high, indicating fluid retention. The left foot wound was debrided, and the patient is being followed up with a chest X-ray. He is on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for infection.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/46 mmHg to 116/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. His temperature is within normal range at 36.2-36.4 degrees Celsius.

The patient's medical history includes cardiomyopathy, chronic right-sided transudative effusion, and a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT). He also has a diagnosis of acute renal failure on chronic renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but liver function tests and electrolyte levels are abnormal. The patient has a positive troponin-T, indicating cardiac injury.

The patient's problems include hypotension, VT, cellulitis, diarrhea, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI), cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and shock. The most likely source of sepsis is the stump infection. The patient's hemodynamics are unstable, and he is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, right below-knee amputation, polycythemia, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia after ablation, cellulitis, diarrhea, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus. The patient presented to the emergency room with drainage from his right stump and was given vancomycin. He was then admitted to the critical care unit due to hypotension and developed sustained ventricular tachycardia, for which he was started on lidocaine and neosynephrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is suspected to have sepsis with a likely source being the stump infection. The hemodynamics show low mean arterial pressure (MAP) despite being on low-dose neosynephrine. The CVP should be checked, aiming for a value greater than 12, and SCVO2 should also be monitored. Another 500cc bolus should be given and the patient's fluid responsiveness assessed. Lactate levels should be trended. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered, and vascularity surgery should be consulted.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: Given the patient's high white blood cell count, diarrhea, and recent antibiotic use, there is a concern for C. diff infection. Both"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint is related to their health progress in the ICU. The patient was taken off pressors and recommended to discontinue the Lidocaine drip after 24 hours. They will be transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] Mexilitine and placed on Amiodarone. The patient experienced 5-6 beat runs of NSVT overnight and was restarted on Lovenox and pain medications.

Allergies include Levofloxacin causing hives, Cefazolin causing nausea/vomiting, Core (Oral) causing fatigue, Dopamine causing ventricular tac, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) causing an unknown reaction. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2131-9-27**] at 12:00 PM.

Infusions include Ranitidine for prophylaxis started on [**2131-9-27**] at 08:00 AM, Enoxaparin (Lovenox) started on [**2131-9-27**] at 10:00 AM, and other ICU medications.

The patient has no significant changes in their medical and family history. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth in the ear, nose, and throat section.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but their blood pressure is on"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic congestive myocardial disease, peripheral vascular disease, and right below-knee amputation. The patient was admitted with sepsis and has been in the ICU since then. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/62 to 116/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is ventricular-paced.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose levels are within normal range. The electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, decreased peripheral pulses in both radial and dorsal pedal arteries, clear chest without wheeze or crackles, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm skin with decreased erythema on the right stump, and left leg wounds closed and dressed.

The patient's assessment and plan include hemodynamics stabilization, infectious source management (soft tissue infection vs. Clostridium difficile), cardiac arrhythmia management (non-sustained ventricular tachycardia), congestive heart failure management (holding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease who underwent right below-knee amputation and was admitted with sepsis. The patient's hemodynamics have improved overnight, and they are off pressors with mean arterial pressures in the 70s. However, the central venous pressure cannot be assessed due to poor waveforms on the left internal jugular line. The patient's heart rate has been stable between 60-90 beats per minute with the exception of runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient's white blood cell count has decreased overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has experienced runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia overnight and is currently being managed with amiodarone and mexiletine. There is a potential for further arrhythmias, and the patient may require an electrophysiology study (EP) ablation with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement early next week.
2. Sepsis: The patient was initially admitted with sepsis, and there is a concern for potential infectious sources, including soft tissue infections or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient remains on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for wound infections and potential recurrence of C. diff"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic congestive myocardial disease, peripheral vascular disease status post right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis and an infectious source suspected to be either a soft tissue infection or Clostridium difficile (C. Diff). The patient has remained on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for wound infections and oral vancomycin for potential recurrence of C. Diff. He has been afebrile overnight with a decrease in white blood cell count. Blood cultures negative for C. Diff twice. 

The patient is experiencing runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with stable vital signs. He is on lidocaine and amiodarone. Plans include optimizing electrolytes, continuing amiodarone and lidocaine, following up with electrophysiology, and planning for ventricular tachycardia ablation on Monday. 

The patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and grossly negative pleural effusion during length of stay. Diurese with a goal of 500 mL net negative and monitor for electrolyte imbalances given frequent NSVT. 

The patient has developed anemia with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) of 40% and overnight Hct of 34%. There is no evidence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and a history of right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis and an infectious source suspected to be either a soft tissue infection or Clostridium difficile. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for wound infections and potential recurrence of C. Diff. He remains afebrile overnight with a decrease in white blood cell count. Clostridium difficile was negative twice.

The patient has been experiencing runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with stable vital signs. He is on mexilitene and amiodarone for this condition. Optimizing electrolytes, continuing amiodarone and mexilitene, and following up with electrophysiology for potential ventricular tachycardia ablation with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement early next week are recommended.

The patient also has an ejection fraction of 20% due to ischemic cardiomyopathy and is holding blood pressure medications. He has chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine clearance between 20-40s and will continue to dose medications accordingly. The patient has diabetes mellitus type II and is on home dose NPH and insulin secretagogue (ISS).

Additionally, the patient has hypercoagulability and is on enoxap"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, right below-knee amputation, polycythemia, hypertension, and ventricular tachycardia post-ablation. The patient was admitted to the ICU for sustained ventricular tachycardia and subsequent hypotension, which required vasopressor support.

The patient has multiple medical complications including shock with a suspected source of infection from the stump, cellulitis, diarrhea, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and a right-sided pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/57 mmHg to 83/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's CVP is elevated at 34 mmHg, indicating potential fluid overload.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 31.7 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab results show abnormalities in electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes. The patient has a negative Clostridium difficile test twice, but it will be checked again due to ongoing diarrhea. The chest X-ray shows a worsening right-sided ple"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, right below-knee amputation, polycythemia, and a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) who presented to the ER with drainage from his right stump and diarrhea. He was given vancomycin in the ER and subsequently developed sustained VT, for which he was started on lidocaine. He also required neosynephrine for hypotension and was transferred to the ICU. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, VT, cellulitis, diarrhea, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, with the source of infection possibly being a stump infection. Hemodynamics are stable, but the patient's CVP is high, holding off further fluid administration. Debridement of the left foot was performed, and the patient will continue on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Clostridium difficile (C diff) testing will be repeated, and vancomycin will be continued.
2. Vtach: The patient's VT is very active, necessitating a restart on IV lidocaine. An electrophysiologist is aware of the plan for VT ablation on Monday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, right below knee amputation, polycythemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the emergency room with complaints of drainage from his right stump and diarrhea. In the CCU, he developed sustained ventricular tachycardia and was started on lidocaine, which broke the VT. He is also being treated with neosynephrine for hypotension. The patient's current conditions include shock possibly due to stump infection, ventricular tachycardia, cellulitis, diarrhea, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's low MAP and high CVP indicate possible sepsis, likely originating from the stump infection. The source of infection should be addressed, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced sustained VT and required restart on IV lidocaine. Further evaluation by the electrophysiologist is planned for VT ablation on Monday.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's oxygen saturation has decreased, indicating worsening respiratory distress. A right-sided pleural effusion has been identified, and efforts should be made to wean off the nasal cannula.
4. Cardiomyopathy: A repeat echocardiogram is needed to assess the patient's cardiac function.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) on Chronic Renal Failure (CRF): Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary. Medications should be adjusted based on renal function.
6. Diarrhea: Although Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been negative twice, it should be checked again, and the patient should continue receiving oral vancomycin.
7. Cellulitis: The patient's right stump is infected, and debridement has already occurred. Continued coverage with vancomycin and Zosyn is recommended.
8. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive, and further fluid resuscitation should be considered after consultation with the healthcare team.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, right below-knee amputation, polycythemia, hypertension, and ventricular tachycardia post-ablation. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, cellulitis, diarrhea, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Shock: The patient is suspected to be in septic shock with a possible source of infection from a stump infection. His hemodynamics show low mean arterial pressure (MAP) and high central venous pressure (CVP), indicating poor perfusion. The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, and further evaluation and management are needed.

2. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced a sustained VT episode, for which he was started on lidocaine. However, the VT recurred, leading to the restart of IV lidocaine this morning. The plan for VT ablation on Monday is still active.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with increased hypoxemia and right-sided pleural effusion. Efforts will be made to wean off the nasal cannula and improve oxygenation.

4. Cardiomyopathy: A repeat echocardiogram is planned to assess the patient's cardiac function and structure."

He presented to the emergency room with complaints of drainage from his right stump and diarrhea. He was given vancomycin and later transferred to the ICU due to hypotension. In the CCU, he developed sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was started on IV lidocaine, which broke the VT. He was also placed on neosynephrine.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Refractory Vtach: The patient continues to experience episodes of VT, despite being on IV lidocaine. There is a plan for VT ablation on Monday.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to an infection. The exact cause is still unclear, but possibilities include cellulitis or osteomyelitis from the right stump or left foot wound.
3. Gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a pH of 7.23 on venous blood gas (VBG) and dropping bicarbonate levels. This could be due to abdominal ischemia"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and below-knee amputation who was admitted with sepsis. The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal limits. The patient remains on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for wound infections and potential recurrence of Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Blood cultures from the nasogastric tube are negative for C. diff.

The patient has been weaned off vasopressors and is currently on dopamine for ventricular rate control. His white blood cell count has decreased, indicating improvement in sepsis.

The patient also has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with stable ventricular systolic size. He is currently on lidocaine and amiodarone for rate control. It is planned to perform an electrophysiology study (EPS) and VT ablation on Monday. The patient's QTc interval will be monitored on the 12-lead ECG due to the QTc prolonging nature of amiodarone and mexiletine.

Additionally, the patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and grossly negative pleural effusion during his length of stay (LOS). Diuretics will be administered to achieve a goal of 500 mL net negative fluid balance. Electro"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease who underwent right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been off pressors for more than 48 hours, indicating stability. There are several potential medical complications to consider:

1. Sepsis: The patient remains on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for wound infections and potential recurrence of Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Despite three negative C. diff tests, the patient continues to have significant diarrhea and will continue taking vancomycin orally during his stay.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient runs of nonsustained VT with stable ventricular systolic function. He is on lidocaine and amiodarone. Optimization of electrolytes is recommended, and amiodarone and lidocaine should be continued until ablation by an electrophysiologist (EP). The patient will be followed up with plans for VT ablation on Monday, and his QTc should be monitored on a 12-lead ECG due to the QTc-prolonging nature of amiodarone.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and has grossly net-positive ple"

   1.       Refractory Vtach: restarted on lidocaine, which seems to have
   helped. Planned for VT ablation on Monday.
   2.       Sepsis.  Not clear precisely what source is.  Suspect that
   stump infection was major culprit; appreciate vascular

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man admitted to the ICU with apparent septic shock, although no cultures have been positive so far. The most likely source of infection was a stump infection. The patient has a complicated medical history, including polycythemia, hypertension, and ventricular tachycardia after ablation. He also experienced ventricular tachycardia that broke on lidocaine. The patient's current issues include refractory ventricular tachycardia, sepsis suspected to be caused by a stump infection, respiratory distress resolved, cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure on chronic renal failure, hypercoagulability treated with low molecular weight heparin, and other remaining issues noted by the housestaff. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory Vtach: The patient's refractory ventricular tachycardia requires ongoing management and may require further intervention such as VT ablation planned for Monday.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis needs to be closely monitored and treated. The source of infection, suspected to be a stump infection, should be addressed appropriately.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy should be evaluated further with repeat Echo.
4. ARF on CRF: The patient's acute renal failure on chronic renal failure should be managed carefully to avoid further complications.
5. Hypercoagulability: The patient is on LM"

The patient is experiencing runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) but remains hemodynamically stable. He is currently on lidocaine and amiodarone, and plans for ventricular tachycardia ablation with an electrophysiologist (EP) are scheduled for Monday.

The patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and has a pleural effusion that has been managed with IV lasix. The goal is to keep the effusion negative again today, and lasix 40 IV will be given, reassessing urine output.

The patient's baseline hemoglobin concentration (Hct) was 40%, which decreased to 34% overnight but has returned to 40.5% without evidence of acute bleeding. The patient will be monitored for any signs of anemia.

The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV with a creatinine clearance between 20"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease who underwent right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been febrile but is now afebrile. His white blood cell count has been stable, and cultures for bacteria and C. difficile have been negative. The patient continues to have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and is receiving lidocaine and amiodarone. He has a known left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% and pleural effusion, which has been managed with IV lasix. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been fluctuating, but no acute bleed has been identified. He is on enoxaparin for hypercoagulability, and his mood is stable. The patient has multiple lines, including a right internal jugular and peripheral intravenous line. His code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU until after the ablation procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis and is still receiving antibiotics for wound infections and potential recurrence of C. difficile. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is crucial.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient continues to experience runs of NSVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease who underwent right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been on a lidocaine drip due to runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and is planned for an ablation procedure by an electrophysiologist (EP) on Monday. He also has a pleural effusion, anemia, chronic kidney disease (CrCl between 20-40s), diabetes mellitus type II, hypercoagulability, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient was initially admitted with sepsis, and there is ongoing concern for an infectious source, possibly soft tissue infection or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient is still on vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for wound infections and potential recurrence of C. diff.
2. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has been experiencing runs of NSVT, which can be a precursor to more serious forms of ventricular arrhythmias. The patient is currently on lidocaine and amiodarone, and it is planned to continue these medications until the ablation procedure.
3. Pleural effusion"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of allergies to levofloxacin, hives from cefazolin, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, and an adverse reaction to dopamine. The patient received a lidocaine drip, which will continue until an ablation procedure performed by an electrophysiologist (EP) on Monday. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin, both administered at 06:00 AM on 09/30/2131. The patient is currently receiving lidocaine at a rate of 1 mg/min and enoxaparin (Lovenox) from the previous day.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the following:

- Vital signs: The patient's maximum temperature recorded was 37.3°C (99.1°F), and the current temperature is 36.1°C (97°F). The heart rate is within normal range (86 bpm), blood pressure is slightly low (102/52 mmHg), respiratory rate is normal (9 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is at 95% on a nasal cannula.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable vitals.
- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,520 mL of fluid, with 1,420 mL given through the oral route, 1,100 mL through IV fluids, and 268 mL through TF (total fluid) intake. Total output consists of 2,070 mL of blood products and 280 mL of urine. The fluid balance is positive at 450 mL with a negative NG output of 12 mL.
- Respiratory support: The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, maintaining an SpO2 of 95%. ABG results show a pH level of 7.25.
- Physical examination findings include a heart rhythm of ventricular paced, unassessed peripheral vascular pulses, unassessed skin, and unassessed neurologic responses.
- Labs: The patient's potassium levels are elevated at 333 K/uL, sodium levels are within normal range at 137 mEq/L, and chloride levels are slightly elevated at 104 mEq/L. Other lab results include elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, glucose levels are within normal range, and other lab values are also within normal limits.
- Radiology images are not available in the provided progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance of 450 mL indicates that the patient may be at risk of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease who underwent right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis and has been on vasopressors for more than 48 hours. The source of infection appears to be a soft tissue infection, but there is also concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) or a pulmonary infection. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased, and cultures for C. diff have been negative three times. However, he continues to experience significant diarrhea, so he will continue receiving oral vancomycin during his stay.

The patient also has episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with stable ventricular systolic function. He is being treated with lidocaine and amiodarone, and plans are in place for an electrophysiology (EP) study with potential ablation on Monday. His QTc interval on the 12-lead ECG will be monitored due to the QTc prolonging nature of amiodarone.

There is evidence of a pleural effusion with a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. The patient has been able to keep the effusion negative, and IV lasix will be administered if needed to achieve a goal of 1 liter net negative again today.

The patient's hemoglobin (H"

   Assessment and Plan
   67-year-old man admitted with apparent septic shock, though no cultures
   positive to date.  Most likely source was stump infection.  PMH is
   quite complicated (including polycythemia, h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 20%, VT s/p
   ablation).  Other major issue has included VT, which broke on
   lidocaine.
   1.       Refractory Vtach: restarted on lidocaine, which seems to have
   helped. Planned for VT ablation on Monday.
   2.       Sepsis.  Not clear precisely what source is.  Suspect that
   stump infection was major culprit; appreciate vascular
s help.  C diff
   has been a [**Last Name 551**] problem for him before.  If decompensates, further
   imaging, evaluation, and possible ID consult.
   3.       Resp Distress: has resolved.  He is stable on 5L n/c.  Would
   eventually consider thoracentesis for right-sided pleural effusion but
   would wait for VT ablation.
   4.       Cardiomyopathy: continue present rx
   5.      ARF on CRF: stable at present
   6.      Hypercoagulability:  on LMWH.  Hold before EP procedure.
   Remaining issues as per housestaff notes
   Patient is critically ill.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted with apparent septic shock, although no cultures have been positive to date. The most likely source of infection was a stump infection. The patient has a complicated medical history, including polycythemia, h/[Initials (NamePattern4)]/[Last Name (NamePattern4)], 20% VT s/p ablation. Other major issues include refractory Vtach, which broke on lidocaine, sepsis with an unknown source, respiratory distress that has resolved, cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure on chronic renal failure, and hypercoagulability.

The patient is currently stable on 5L n/c oxygen and being treated with various medications such as lidocaine for refractory Vtach, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, dopamine, carvedilol, lasix, lovenox, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 115/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side, warm skin, and normal neurologic function. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels. Other lab values are within normal range"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected acute myocardial infarction. The patient received Ativan for anxiety before a planned procedure. I/O status shows an intake of 877 mL and output of 2132 mL, with no extra Lasix given in the pm. The patient experienced repeated runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and the lidocaine dosage was increased to 1 mg/min. Magnesium levels were low at 1.9 mg/dL, so it was repleted with 2g at 3:45 AM. Potassium levels were stable at 4.5 mEq/L. The patient is on several medications including dopamine, carvedilol, furosemide, enoxaparin, and various antibiotics.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/68 mmHg to 127/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support and is connected to a multi-lumen line for ICU care.

   Communication:
   Code status: Full code
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease who underwent right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis but is now hemodynamically stable without the need for pressors. His extremities appear improved, but he continues to have loose stools, although Clostridium difficile-negative three times. The patient is running a fever and has an increased white blood cell count. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74-95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is ventricular paced, and his weight is currently 51.7 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia overnight and will undergo ablation today. Lidocaine has been increased to 1 mg due to the VT, and amiodarone will be continued.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion appears worse on chest X-ray today, indicating possible worsening respiratory support or infection.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and guaiac stools should be monitored.
4. Chronic kidney disease"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease who underwent right below-knee amputation. The patient was admitted with sepsis and is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events include administration of Ativan for anxiety before a planned procedure, repeated runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), increased lidocaine dosage, and magnesium repletion. The patient's potassium level is 4.5, and morning labs will be checked.

Allergies include levofloxacin, hives; cefazolin, nausea/vomiting; carvedilol, fatigue; and dopamine, ventricular tachycardia.

Infusions include lidocaine at 1 mg/min, and other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) and enoxaparin (Lovenox). The patient is also on several other medications.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the below notes. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/68 mmHg to 86/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is ventricular-paced.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 995 mL,"

   positive to date.  Most likely source was stump infection.  PMH is
   quite complicated (including polycythemia, h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 20%, VT s/p
   ablation).  Other major issue has included VT, which broke on
   lidocaine.
   1.        Refractory Vtach: restarted on lidocaine, which seems to have
   helped. Planned for VT ablation on Monday.
   2.        Sepsis.  Not clear precisely what source is.  Suspect that
   stump infection was major culprit; appreciate vascular
s help.  C diff
   has been a [**Last Name 551**] problem for him before.  If decompensates, further
              imaging, evaluation, and possible ID consult.
   3.        Resp Distress: has resolved.  He is stable on 5L n/c.  Would
   eventually consider thoracentesis for right-sided pleural effusion but
   would wait for VT ablation.
   4.        Cardiomyopathy: continue present rx- goal 500 to 1000 cc neg
   5.        ARF on CRF: stable at present
   6.        Hypercoagulability:  on LMWH.  Hold before EP procedure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man admitted with apparent septic shock, although no cultures have been positive to date. The most likely source of the infection was a stump infection. The patient has a complicated medical history, including polycythemia, hemothrancosis, and ventricular tachycardia (VT) after ablation. Other major issues include refractory VT, sepsis, respiratory distress, cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure on chronic renal failure (ARF on CRF), and hypercoagulability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory Vtach: The patient's ventricular tachycardia did not respond to initial treatment and required restarting on lidocaine. Further interventions, such as VT ablation, are planned.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, with a suspected source being a stump infection. If the patient's condition worsens, additional imaging, evaluation, and possible infectious disease consultation may be necessary.
3. Resp Distress: The patient previously experienced respiratory distress, which has since resolved. However, the patient is still stable on 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. A thoracentesis for the right-sided pleural effusion may be considered after the VT ablation.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has cardiomyopathy, and the current treatment aims to achieve negative fluid balance of 500 to 1000 cc"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and a history of right below-knee amputation. The patient was admitted with sepsis and has since undergone a ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation procedure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics for sepsis and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the patient's vital signs, white blood cell count, and clinical symptoms are necessary to detect any signs of infection.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient had runs of nonsustained VT, which indicates the need for ongoing monitoring of the heart rhythm and potential adjustment of antiarrhythmic medications.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient's pleural effusion worsened over the weekend, as evidenced by increased fluid accumulation on chest X-ray. This may require further investigation and management, including consideration for thoracentesis.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, but it is important to monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to ensure they remain within acceptable ranges.

5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (CrCl) indicates stage III-IV chronic kidney disease. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate medication dosing adjustments are necessary.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient underwent VT ablation, during which he experienced the loss of left foot pulse that was later dopplered while in the CCU. Propofol was changed to Versed/Fentanyl. The patient is on amiodarone and a beta-blocker. 

Post-catheterization, the patient's Hct was 46.8% and potassium level was 5.2. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient's urine analysis revealed 11-20 WBCs, many bacteria, moderate yeast, and some leukocytes. An arterial blood gas (ABG) at midnight showed pH 7.30, HCO3- 42, PO2 390, and SaO2 21. A subsequent ABG at 4 am showed increased neomycin levels.

The patient has allergies to levofloxacin, hives; cefazolin, nausea/vomiting; carvedilol, fatigue; and dopamine, ventricular tachycardia. 

The patient is receiving several medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), fentanyl, phenylephrine, lidocaine, midazolam (Versed), ranitidine (prophylaxis), and furosemide (Lasix).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (34-160 bpm), blood pressure of 102/60 mmHg (71-146/90 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (6-20 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular-paced. The patient has a weight loss of 2 kg since admission. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,985 mL, including 329 mL of IV fluids. The patient's output includes 1,150 mL of blood products, 800 mL of urine, and 185 mL of stool. The patient's NG output was not assessed. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV)/assistant mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 25 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, compliance of 32.4 cmH2O/mL, and oxygen saturation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted with sepsis, likely secondary to cellulitis or colitis, as well as ventricular tachycardia (VT) status post previous ablation. The patient underwent VT ablation yesterday but experienced episodes of non-sustained VT during the procedure. He was intubated and placed on low-dose neomycin while sedated with propofol. The patient received 2 liters of oxygen during the procedure. During the procedure, the patient's left foot pulse was lost but was later dopplerized. Propofol was changed to versed/fentanyl. The patient was advised to continue on amiodarone and a beta-blocker. At 8:30 pm, the patient had runs of VT. Post-catheterization, the patient's hemoglobin concentration was 46.8%, potassium level was 5.2 mEq/L, and ejection fraction (EF) was 20%. An echocardiogram during the procedure showed a slightly larger left ventricular cavity compared to a prior study. Urinalysis revealed 11-20 white blood cells (WBCs), many bacteria, moderate yeast, and small leukocytes. An arterial blood gas (ABG) at midnight showed pH 7.30, PaCO2 42 mmHg, PaO2 390 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) 21 mEq/L. An ABG at 4 am showed increased neomycin levels. The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and cardiac catheterization. Electrolyte levels were within normal range. The patient's allergies include levofloxacin (hives), cefazolin (nausea/vomiting), carvedilol (fatigue), and dopamine (ventricular tachycardia). The patient received vancomycin, piperacillin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 80 and 160 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/60 to 146/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient was sedated, intubated, and responded to voice commands. Physical examination revealed diffuse rhonchi and upper airway sounds, some basilar rales on the right greater than left, flat and soft abdomen, palpable pulse in the left femoral region, and cool extremities. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (33.7 K/uL), hemoglobin concentration (46.8%), leukocyte count (360), platelet count (25.2 K/uL),"

   Assessment and Plan
   67-year-old man admitted with apparent septic shock, though no cultures
   positive to date.  Most likely source was stump infection.  PMH is
   quite complicated (including polycythemia, h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 20%, VT s/p
   ablation).  Other major issue has included VT, which broke on
   lidocaine.
   1.        Refractory Vtach: restarted on lidocaine, s/p substrate
   ablation. Will start Mixelitine po and overlap with Amio appreciate EP
   input
   2.        Sepsis.  Not clear precisely what source is.  Still suspect
   that stump infection was major culprit; appreciate vascular
s help.  C
   diff has been a [**Last Name 551**] problem for him before and we are keeping on Rx
   while on ABX for stump infx.  Perhaps leukocytosis today is post EP
   procudre
 hard to know-0 no fever and we need to trend it.
   3.        Resp Distress: Intubated post procedure but was very volume
   overloaded. Will switch to PSV goal neg 1L and then SBT and extubate
   this afternoon
   4.        Cardiomyopathy: continue present rx- goal 500 to 1000 cc neg
   5.        ARF on CRF: stable at present
   6.        Hypercoagulability:  on LMWH.  Hold before EP procedure.
   Remaining issues as per housestaff notes
   Patient is critically ill.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted with apparent septic shock, although no cultures have been positive to date. The most likely source of infection was a stump infection. The patient's medical history is complicated, including polycythemia, hemothorax, and ventricular tachycardia (VT) after substrate ablation. The patient's current issues include refractory VT, sepsis, respiratory distress, cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure on chronic renal failure, and hypercoagulability. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory VT: The patient has experienced episodes of VT that have not responded to treatment. Further interventions may be necessary to manage this condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient may be at risk for further complications related to sepsis, especially if the source of infection is not identified and treated appropriately.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress requires close monitoring and management. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and eventual extubation will depend on the patient's improvement.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy may contribute to his overall cardiac function and should be managed accordingly.
5. ARF on CRF: The patient's acute renal failure is superimposed on chronic renal failure, which requires careful monitoring and management of renal function.
6. Hypercoagulability: The patient is at an increased risk of thromboembolic events"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. They experienced a ventricular tachycardia (vtach) episode. The patient underwent an esophageal echo and cardiac catheterization, but was unable to induce vtach during the procedure. The patient is still on lidocaine and neo but is being weaned off. They have allergies to levofloxacin, cefazolin, carvedilol, dopamine, and ventricular tac. The patient received various antibiotics including piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin. They are currently on multiple infusions including phenylephrine, fentanyl, lidocaine, and midazolam. Other medications such as furosemide were given as well. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for specific notes mentioned above. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/60 to 146/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is currently 51.7 kg. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,985 mL and output of 1,150 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with settings such as Vt at 550 mL,"

   Assessment and Plan
   67-year-old man admitted with apparent septic shock, though no cultures
   positive to date.  Most likely source was stump infection.  PMH is
   quite complicated (including polycythemia, h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 20%, VT s/p
   ablation).  Other major issue has included VT, which broke on
   lidocaine.
   1.        Refractory Vtach: restarted on lidocaine, s/p substrate
   ablation. Will start Mixelitine
   2.        Sepsis.  Not clear precisely what source is.  Suspect that
   stump infection was major culprit; appreciate vascular
s help.  C diff
   has been a [**Last Name 551**] problem for him before.  If decompensates, further
   imaging, evaluation, and possible ID consult.
   3.        Resp Distress: Intubated post procedure- will switch to PSV
   goal neg 1L and then SBT and extubate in AM
   4.        Cardiomyopathy: continue present rx- goal 500 to 1000 cc neg
   5.        ARF on CRF: stable at present
   6.        Hypercoagulability:  on LMWH.  Hold before EP procedure.
   Remaining issues as per housestaff notes

","The patient is a 67-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including polycythemia, hemothorax, and VT s/p ablation. He was admitted with apparent septic shock, although no cultures have been positive to date. The most likely source of infection was a stump infection. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.8 C (98.2 F), HR: 81 bpm, BP: 88/60 mmHg, RR: 16 breaths per minute, SpO2: 98%. He is intubated and sedated, with a right below-knee amputation and decreased blood supply in the right chest. 

His lab results show a WBC count of 33.7 K/uL, Hct of 41.2%, Plt of 471, Cr of 1.7 mg/dL, TropT of 0.08, TCO2 of 23, Glucose of 65 mg/dL, and other labs within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include refractory Vtach, sepsis, respiratory distress, cardiomyopathy, ARF on CRF, and hypercoagulability. He is critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to organ dysfunction or failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, deep vein throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   66yoM with DMII, Ischemic CM, PVD s/p R BKA admitted with sepsis,
   likely [**1-27**] to cellulitis or colitis also w/ VT s/p previous ablation.
   # VT
 Underwent VT-ablation yesterday, though did have VT during
   ablation. EP ablated around previous scar. had tenuous pressures w/
   sedation and was started on Neo and kept intubated.  Overnight pt had
   [**2-27**] Runs of NSVT for 30-60seconds, with stable VSS.
   -          Cont Amiodarone
   -          Continue Lidocaine 1mg/min
   -          Start  Mexiletine when taking PO and overlap for 24 h w/
   lidocaine.
   -          Monitor QTc on 12 lead given QTc prolonging nature of
   amiodarone
   # Sepsis: Afbrile andhemodynamically stable off pressors for the last
   48hour, now back on pressors this am but being weaned off and will
   likely be off later this morning. WBC up from 25 to 33.7 after the
   procedure, which might be [**1-27**] demarginization. However, there is also a
   UA w/ 6-10RBCs, 11-22WBC, although this is difficult to interpret given
   WBC of 35 and high baseline [**1-27**] hx of polycythemia. Extremeties look
   greatly improved from previous, though appear somewhat peripherally
   vasoconstricted from Neo this am. Pt continues to have very loose
   stools although C Diff Negative x3.
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosy for 10 day course, currently day #7
   -          Will continue on PO Vanc while on abx given pts hx of
   recurrent C Diff
   # Pleural effusion
 Significantly improved this am on ventilaror,
   suggesting effusion that was mobilized with increased positive
   pressure.
   -          Will continue with diuresis post EP  procedure.
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] consider R thoracentesis later when more stable
   # Anemia  - Stable, HCT 41.2 down from 46.8. Likely somewhat contracted
   intravascularlly.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous below-knee amputation. He was admitted with sepsis, likely secondary to cellulitis or colitis, along with ventricular tachycardia (VT) following a previous ablation procedure. The patient underwent VT-ablation yesterday, although he experienced VT during the ablation. Electrophysiological ablation targeted the previous scar and was performed under sedation, resulting in tenuous pressures. He was started on Neo and remained intubated.

During the overnight period, the patient had runs of nonsustained VT for 30-60 seconds with stable ventricular systolic function. The plan includes continuing amiodarone, continuing lidocaine at a rate of 1 mg/min, starting mexiletine when taking oral medication and overlapping with lidocaine for 24 hours, and monitoring the QTc interval on a 12-lead ECG due to the QTc prolonging nature of amiodarone.

The patient is also being treated for sepsis, initially being off pressors for the last 48 hours but now back on pressors this morning. He is being weaned off and is expected to be off later this morning. His white blood cell count has increased from 25 to 33.7 after the procedure, which might be due to demargination. However,"

His white blood cell count has decreased from 33.7 to 22K, and extremity erythema has reduced. He continues to experience very loose stools, but C. difficile is negative for the third time. Vancomycin level is at 40.0 this morning, and it will be held for the remainder of the 10-day course. Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) will be continued for a 10-day course, currently on day #8, and oral vancomycin will be continued while on antibiotics due to the patient's history of recurrent C. difficile infection.

The patient is now on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula after being extubated. The pressors have been tapered off, and he is hemodynamically stable. His ventricular tachycardia is being managed with lidocaine at a reduced rate of 0.5mg/min and mexilitine 150mg taken three times a day. Telemonitoring and electrocardiogram follow-up"

   Assessment and Plan
   67-year-old man admitted with resolvedseptic shock due to stump
   infection.  PMH is quite complicated (including polycythemia, h/o
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 20%, VT s/p ablation).  Other major issue has included VT,
   which broke on lidocaine.
   1.        Refractory Vtach: restarted on lidocaine, s/p substrate
   ablation. Better on Mixelitine po and overlap with Lido  - will d/c
   Lido. Appreciate EP input
   2.        Sepsis.  Not clear precisely what source is.  Still suspect
   that stump infection was major culprit; appreciate vascular
s help.  C
   diff has been a [**Last Name 551**] problem for him before and we are keeping on Rx
   while on ABX for stump infx.  Perhaps leukocytosis today is post EP
   procedure
 hard to know-0 no fever and we need to trend it.
   3.        Resp Distress:
   4.        Cardiomyopathy: continue present rx- goal 500 to 1000 cc neg
   5.        ARF on CRF: stable at present
   6.        Hypercoagulability:  on LMWH.  Hold before EP procedure.
   Remaining issues as per housestaff notes

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including polycythemia, a history of sepsis secondary to stump infection, ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was refractory to treatment but improved with lidocaine and substrate ablation. The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, possibly from the stump infection, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He also has respiratory distress, cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure on chronic renal failure (ARF on CRF), and hypercoagulability. The patient is critically ill and is receiving ICU care. He is on multiple medications including antibiotics for the stump infection, lidocaine for VT, and enoxaparin for hypercoagulability. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and lactate levels. His electrolytes are within normal range, but his kidney function tests and liver function tests show abnormalities. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and heart rate, but he has a slightly elevated respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a history of resolved septic shock due to a stump infection. He has a complicated medical history including polycythemia, a history of [Last Name (LF)] [First Name3 (LF) 300] at 20%, and VT s/p ablation. The patient's current issues include refractory Vtach, sepsis, respiratory distress, cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure on chronic renal failure, and hypercoagulability. The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory Vtach: The patient has been experiencing ventricular tachycardia (VTach) which is refractory to treatment. This condition can lead to serious complications such as hemodynamic instability, decreased cardiac output, and potential arrhythmias.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis related to a stump infection. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

3. Respiratory Distress: The patient has had episodes of respiratory distress. This can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, fluid accumulation in the lungs, or complications from mechanical ventilation. Respiratory distress can lead to hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular collapse.
