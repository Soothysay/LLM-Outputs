","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease who was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and viral gastroenteritis. The patient initially improved but was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to the recurrence of DKA symptoms, including low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and decreased insulin doses.

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's low insulin doses may have led to the development of DKA, which is characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's anion gap closed quickly after initiating insulin therapy.
2. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever, indicating the possibility of an underlying infection. Blood cultures have been sent to rule out any infectious causes.
3. Gastroparesis: The patient has a history of gastroparesis, a condition that affects the movement of food through the digestive system. This can cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. He is scheduled to receive hemodialysis (HD) today.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently elevated during admission, ranging from 170-200 mmHg. His current regimen includes amlodip"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 1 with gastroparesis, and chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. He was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and viral gastroenteritis, initially improved, but now transferred back to the MICU for recurrent DKA in the setting of low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and recent decreases in insulin doses. He has worsened renal failure and anion gap metabolic acidosis with concern for DKA.

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient is likely experiencing DKA due to decreased insulin doses. The initial anion gap closed quickly after transfer and initiation of insulin gtt. He is currently tolerating PO intake, but not well, so continuing with dextrose infusion. Patient now written for subcutaneous insulin scale, but fingersticks are consistently low enough that no doses have been given. C/w Q1 hour fingersticks, PO intake as tolerated, once tolerating PO intake and giving subcutaneous injections, can discontinue insulin gtt; need 1-2 hr overlap to avoid rebound hyperglycemia.
2. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating worsening renal failure. He is planned for dialysis today. Renal dosing of all medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended. Trans"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted on [**2-18**] for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and viral gastroenteritis, and has since been transferred to the MICU for recurrent DKA. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, elevated serum creatinine, and signs of electrolyte imbalance. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 141/67 to 148/83 mmHg. The patient is currently on insulin injections and tolerating a regular diet.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes and has experienced recurrent episodes of DKA during his hospital stay. It is crucial to monitor his blood glucose levels closely and ensure proper insulin management upon discharge.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated throughout his admission, ranging from 170-200 mmHg. He is currently on multiple antihypertensive medications. It is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure to prevent complications such as heart attack or stroke.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has a history of CKD and requires ongoing management, including hemodialysis. Monitoring his renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly will be essential.
