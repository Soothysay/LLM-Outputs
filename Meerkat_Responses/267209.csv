","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with a tracheostomy in place. She presents for removal of the tracheostomy and concern for altered mental status.

The patient is well-appearing and comfortable. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/40 to 183/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.27, indicating respiratory acidosis.

Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in the general, head and neck, lung, heart, abdomen, extremities, or skin assessments. Neurological examination shows that the patient is awake, alert, oriented to time, place, and person, with grossly intact cranial nerves, normal muscle strength, intact sensation, symmetric deep tendon reflexes, intact cerebellar exam, and steady gait.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, memory loss after hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with a tracheostomy in place. She presents with abdominal pain, multiple loose stools, subjective abdominal distention, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly caused by central and obstructive apnea, chronic paralyzed right hemidiaphragm, and obesity hypoventilation. She has also been diagnosed with colitis, possible small bowel obstruction, mass, hernia, ileus, or constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as pneumonia is a common complication in ICU patients, especially those with tracheostomies.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, loose stools, and subjective abdominal distention, there is a risk of infection leading to sepsis. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be implemented.
4. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Gastr"

   63F with history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely from OSA

   status over the last 2 months per patient's husband. Abdominal pain
   overnight as well, with CT abdomen consistent with ileus, likely from
   opiates.
   For chronic respiratory failure, will discuss with IP future steps in
   management of trach (will likely get bronchoscopy to reassess tracheal
   tear then trach downsize) including possible down-sizing to 6.0 for
   trial of trach capping in preparation for trach removal. Will try to
   clarify why she could not come for an appt as outpatient.
   For abdominal distension and pain, enema, needs rectal exam and
   possible disimpaction. Follow-up final abd ct read.
   Chronic mental status changes need outpatient work-up. Will send RPR,

   Probable sleep apnea: she will need a sleep study once she can tolerate

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with a tracheostomy in place. She presents for tracheostomy removal and has concerns about altered mental status.

The patient's recent events include an EKG, CT abdomen showing an acute anterior compression fracture at T12 with no evidence of other acute intra-abdominal pathology, and a CXR indicating mild nodular interstitial thickening that may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia. The CEs were negative, and the patient was taken off the vent overnight. She also experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4Â°C (99.3Â°F)
- Heart rate: 105 bpm (normal range 72-105 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 140/52 mmHg (normal range 75/36-185/97 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (normal range 15-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 510 mL and output of 675 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 165 mL. The respiratory support shows that the patient is on standby"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with a tracheostomy in place. She presents for tracheostomy removal and concerns about altered mental status. The patient has been off the ventilator overnight and has been downsized from her tracheostomy. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could worsen due to factors such as central and obstructive apnea, a paralyzed right hemidiaphragm, and obesity hypoventilation.
2. Compression fracture: The patient has an acute anterior compression fracture at the T12 level. Further evaluation and consideration for orthopedic consultation may be necessary.
3. Abdominal pain and loose stool: The patient presents with abdominal pain, loose stool, subjective abdominal distention. Differential diagnoses include colitis, small bowel obstruction (SBO), mass, hernia, ileus, or constipation. Further investigation, such as a final abdominal CT read, may be needed.
4. Atrial fibrillation (PAfib): The patient has atrial fibrillation that is currently rate-controlled. Anticoagulation therapy is generally recommended for patients with atr"

   require ventilator support with open trach.
   Mrs [**Known lastname 5699**] is ready to return home. She will need follow-up with IP
   and sleep clinic. Social work will be addressing whether follow up can
   be done at [**Hospital1 5**] or if it needs to be at [**Location (un) 8547**].
   Incidentally noted spine fracture requires additional medical work-up,
   including checking Vit D levels. She  has fallen in the past, and there
   is no evidence of metastatic disease. Will reassess whether she is up
   to date with routine cancer screening. For now will treat with ca, vit
   D, and bisphosphonate for secondary prevention. DEXA scan as
   outpatient. PT needs to see her as well.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with recent hypercarbic respiratory failure and a tracheal tear associated with prior intubation. She presented for an elective tracheostomy change, which was performed successfully this morning. The patient is currently doing well and did not require ventilator support overnight.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/43 mmHg to 185/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy mask.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, normal pupils, normocephalic head, and distant heart sounds. The patient has diminished breath sounds at the right base and rhonchi throughout the chest. There is evidence of right and left lower extremity edema, but no cyanosis or clubbing. The patient's skin is warm and there are no rashes or jaundice. Neurological examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and is oriented to time, place, and person. Movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Electro"

The tracheostomy was placed on [**3-12**], and the patient tolerated being off the ventilator at night. The tracheostomy was downsized yesterday.
2. Rising WBCs: This is concerning for an infection, and tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and urinary tract infection (UTI) have been negative. A repeat chest X-ray and sputum culture are recommended to further investigate for possible pneumonia.
3. Compression fracture: The patient has a compression fracture seen at the level of T12. Follow-up with orthopedics for further evaluation and management, including continuing calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
4. Abdominal pain, loose stool, subjective abdominal distention: These symptoms are likely due to constipation. Measures should be taken to minimize opiates and continue the bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-appearing man who is comfortable and appropriate for his age. He has a history of chronic respiratory failure, altered mental status, and abdominal pain. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 59 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/32 to 181/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including tracheostomy, nutritional support, glycemic control, central venous catheter placement, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's mild nodular interstitial thickening in the left lower lobe may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia. If left untreated, it could progress to a full-blown pneumonia, leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and possible sepsis.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization and central venous catheter placement. If not adequately prophylaxed, DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening condition.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been"

 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2103-7-12**] 08:15 AM
   for downsizing the trach [**Last Name (un) 1821**] # 6
   [**7-11**]:
   - CT Abdomen: 1. Acute anterior compression fracture at T12.  2. No
   evidence of other acute intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CXR: Low lung volumes limit evaluation of the lung parenchyma.  Mild
   nodular interstitial thickening especially within the left lower lobe
   may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia. Clinical correlation
   is recommended.
   - CEs were negative
   - IP will attempt to downsize trach tomorrow. NPO after MN for
   procedure
   - Was given Fleets enema and Lactulose x2 -> No BM
   - Took her off the vent O/N
   [**7-12**]:
   - decided we would try to get her to inpatient rehab
   - stayed off the vent
   - IP downsized trach
   - placed cap on trach and was able to breath comfortably
   - spoke to husband about need to schedule neurosurgery f/u and clarify
   when they can restart coumadin (they have an HMO and must be referred
   by PCP)
   - scheduled appointment with IP as outpatient for trach f/u
   - got 2 mg morphine overnight for RUQ pain
   - for sleep apnea, tried to place on cpap overnight with trach capped
   but respiratory didn't think she'd tolerate it b/c of secretions and
   claustrophobia so ended up uncapping her.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, memory loss after hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient presents for removal of tracheostomy and concern for altered mental status.

From the note, it is mentioned that the patient tolerated being off the ventilator at night and had a tracheostomy placed on [**3-12**]. The tracheostomy was downsized yesterday. The initial chest X-ray was equivocal for pneumonia, but now with rising white blood cell count, a repeat chest X-ray and sputum culture are recommended.

The patient also has a rising WBC count, which is concerning for an infection. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and urinary catheter-associated infection tests were negative. A repeat chest X-ray and sputum culture are advised, along with monitoring the fever curve.

There is a potential compression fracture seen at the level of T12. An orthopedic consultation is considered, and calcium/vitamin D supplementation should be continued.

The patient experiences abdominal pain, loose stool, and subjective abdominal distention, which are likely due to constipation. Minimizing opiates and continuing the bowel regimen are recommended.

Regarding the patient's atrial fibrillation, it is currently rate-controlled, and no anticoagulation is given due to"

   unclear reasons. Suspect that secretions are the primary reasons for
   intolerance of trach capping. For now, the safest approach is to keep
   the patient with open trach at night, valve or cap during the day, and
   to continue to stay off ventilator.
   She may be developing a pneumonia based on rising wbc, secretions, and
   hyperglycemia. CXR is reassuring but sputum culture is pending. Low
   threshold to start antibiotics based on sputum cultures and OSH
   cultures.
   Spine fracture requires TLSO brace and ortho followup.
   Neurosurgery will review imaging and assess whether pt needs to be off

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and tracheal tear following tracheostomy. She is currently in the ICU and underwent a tracheostomy change. The patient has been off the ventilator for two nights and is doing well. However, there are several concerns to address during her transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intolerance to tracheostomy cap: The patient did not tolerate the tracheostomy cap overnight, suggesting possible intolerance to it. This may be due to secretions or other factors. It is recommended to keep the tracheostomy open at night and use a valve or cap during the day.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's rising white blood cell count, presence of secretions, and hyperglycemia raise concerns about the development of pneumonia. A chest X-ray is reassuring, but the results of the sputum culture are pending. A low threshold should be maintained to start antibiotics based on the sputum cultures and oral secretions culture.
3. Spine fracture: The patient has a spine fracture that requires a TLSO brace and orthopedic follow-up.
4. Neurosurgical evaluation: Due to the patient's imaging, a neurosurgery review is necessary to assess whether the patient needs to be off anticoagulation and whether she still requires Keppra.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable, but careful monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and tracheal tear who underwent a tracheostomy. She is currently in the ICU and has had a recent tracheostomy change. The patient tolerated the tracheostomy change well and has been successfully weaned off the ventilator for two nights in a row.

The patient has a history of not tolerating capped tracheostomy at night, possibly due to secretions. Therefore, it is recommended to keep the patient uncapped at night and use a valve or cap during the day. The patient's respiratory status should continue to be monitored closely.

There are concerns about the development of pneumonia, as indicated by the rising white blood cell count, presence of secretions, and hyperglycemia. A chest X-ray is reassuring, but sputum culture results are pending. It may be necessary to start antibiotics based on the sputum cultures and other source site cultures.

The patient also has a spine fracture requiring a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) brace and orthopedic follow-up. Neurosurgery will review imaging and determine if the patient needs to be off anticoagulation and whether she still needs Keppra (an antiepileptic medication).

ICU care includes glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and she is ready for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Development of pneumonia: The patient's rising white blood cell count, presence of secretions, and hyperglycemia may indicate an ongoing infection or the development of pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and timely initiation of appropriate antibiotics based on sputum cultures and other source site cultures will be crucial.
2. Tracheostomy-related issues: The patient has shown intolerance to capped tracheostomy at night, which can lead to airway obstruction and respiratory compromise. Continuous monitoring of the patient's airway and ensuring proper tracheostomy management are essential.
3. Spine fracture management: The patient has a spine fracture that requires a TLSO brace and orthopedic follow-up. Appropriate immobilization and management of the spine fracture are important to prevent further complications.
4. Anticoagulation management: The patient's need for anticoagulation should be assessed by neurosurgery based on imaging results. Monitoring for bleeding complications and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary will be important.
5. Seizure management: The patient is currently on Keppra, an antiepileptic medication. Neurosurgery will review imaging and determine if the patient still requires this medication. Close monitoring for seizure activity and appropriate management will be essential.

Overall, the patient's respiratory status, potential development of pneumonia, tracheostomy-related issues, spine fracture management, anticoagulation management, and seizure management require careful attention to prevent potential complications."
