","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of left-sided brain cancer, likely lymphoma, who has been admitted for observation and initiation of chemotherapy. She is currently in the ICU due to deteriorating clinical status and worsening cerebral edema. The patient is unresponsive and showing signs of severe encephalopathy. Imaging and preliminary pathology suggest primary CNS lymphoma with vasogenic edema and midline shift. The patient is immunosuppressed and may not mount fever or leukocytosis. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is currently on multiple medications including steroids, mannitol, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's deteriorating clinical status and worsening cerebral edema indicate an increased risk of elevated ICP. This can lead to further neurological deterioration and potential brain herniation if not managed appropriately.
2. Seizures: The patient is at an increased risk for seizures due to the presence of brain tumor and associated edema. Keppra has been initiated for seizure prophylaxis.
3. Infection: As the patient is immunosuppressed, there is a higher risk of infections such as meningoencephalitis. Empiric antibiotics have been started to cover potential bacterial infections.
4. Renal impairment: The patient's urine output and fluid balance should be closely monitored for signs of renal impairment.
5. Thromboembolic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of left-sided brain cancer, likely lymphoma, admitted for observation and initiation of chemotherapy. The patient has been deteriorating clinically with worsening cerebral edema and effacement. Imaging and preliminary pathology indicate primary CNS lymphoma with vasogenic edema and midline shift causing severe encephalopathy. There is low suspicion for meningo-encephalitis as the gram stain from biopsy swab was negative, and other explanations for the clinical scenario have been considered. The patient is immunosuppressed and may not mount fever or leukocytosis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/62 mmHg to 124/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving mannitol infusions and other ICU medications. Fluid balance shows an intake of 220 mL, output of 160 mL, and a positive balance of 60 mL.

Laboratory results show white blood cell count ranging from 9.9 to 14.4 K/uL, hemoglobin ranging from 10.8 to 11.5 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 37 to 105 K/uL, blood glucose levels up to 227 mg/dL, and other lab values"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of left-sided brain cancer, likely lymphoma. She was admitted for observation and initiation of chemotherapy. The patient has been deteriorating clinically with worsening cerebral edema and effacement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/62 mmHg to 124/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is unarousable and non-verbal, with unequal pupil sizes that are reactive. Her cardiovascular examination reveals regular bradycardia with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Pulmonary examination shows clear chest auscultation with no wheezes, crackles, or diminished breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals obesity with soft and non-tender normal bowel sounds. Extremities are warm, dry, and have pedal edema bilaterally. Neurological examination shows non-purposeful spontaneous movements, no follow of commands, reflexive squeezing of fingers with the left hand but not releasing upon request, 2+ deep tendon reflexes on the right side, 1+ on the left side, and absent ankle jerks with an upgoing right toe and mute left toe.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of left-sided brain cancer, likely primary CNS lymphoma. She has been experiencing intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, which led to clinical deterioration. However, she is now stable with slight improvement in neurological status after receiving systemic methotrexate (MTX). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/64 to 144/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation and is responsive to verbal stimuli.

Her physical examination shows somnolence but arousable to verbal stimuli. Neurological examination reveals right pupil 6 mm, left pupil 5 mm, reactive to light, and right toe upgoing, left toe mute. She has intact DTRs on the right and 1+ on the left, with absent ankle jerks.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus are within normal range.

Plan:
1. Continue dexamethasone at 8 mg every 8 hours, and provide 10 mg IV if there is acute decompensation.
2. Repeat head CT today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of left-sided brain cancer, likely primary CNS lymphoma. She presented with intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, leading to clinical deterioration. The patient has shown slight improvement in neurological status after receiving systemic methotrexate (MTX). She is currently stable and continues to receive various treatments and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) - The patient's condition is complicated by intracranial hypertension, which can lead to further neurological deterioration if not managed appropriately.
2. Seizures - The patient is on keppra for seizure prophylaxis, indicating a risk of seizures due to brain injury or tumor.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - As the patient is critically ill and likely to be on mechanical ventilation, she is at risk for developing VAP.
5. Infection - The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the cancer and treatment, making her more susceptible to infections.
6. Renal dysfunction - The patient's urine output and serum creatinine levels indicate a potential risk for renal dysfunction.
7. Hypoglycemia - The patient is on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, so there is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of left-sided brain cancer, likely lymphoma, who was admitted for observation and initiation of chemotherapy. She has deteriorating clinical status with worsening cerebral edema and effacement. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with mannitol for cerebral edema, steroids for brain cancer treatment, and anticonvulsants for seizure prophylaxis. She is also receiving medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's worsening cerebral edema and effacement can lead to increased ICP. This can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and potentially brain herniation if left untreated.
2. Seizures: The patient is at an increased risk of seizures due to her brain cancer and the associated cerebral edema. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Infection: Due to her immunosuppressed state from steroids and chemotherapy, the patient is at a higher risk of developing infections, including meningoencephalitis. Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and cancer increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued.
5. Stress Ulcer Disease: The patient is on proton"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of left-sided brain cancer, likely lymphoma, who was admitted for observation and initiation of chemotherapy. She is currently in the ICU due to deteriorating clinical status and worsening cerebral edema. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/64 to 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological status is described as severe encephalopathy with effacement, and she is unresponsive with no movement or tone. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal creatinine, glucose levels, and electrolytes. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema and effacement, which can lead to herniation if not managed appropriately.
2. Seizures due to the brain tumor and associated changes in brain electrical activity.
3. Infection, particularly meningitis, given the immunosuppressed state and low-grade fever. Empiric antibiotics may be necessary despite the absence of fever or leukocytosis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immob"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of CNS lymphoma, who underwent a CNS biopsy and started treatment with MTX. Her course has been complicated by significant cerebral edema. She is currently receiving Mannitol and Decadron for the cerebral edema, along with isotonic fluids. Her vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing fatigue and right hemi-paresis without change.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CNS Lymphoma: The patient's underlying condition may progress despite treatment, leading to worsening neurological symptoms.
2. Cerebral Edema: The patient's cerebral edema may worsen, potentially causing increased intracranial pressure and compromised brain function.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state from chemotherapy and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
5. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored to prevent complications such as renal failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy (Heparin) puts her at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Medication Side Effects: The patient may experience side effects from the medications she is receiving,"

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of left-sided brain cancer, likely primary CNS lymphoma. She has been admitted to the ICU for intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation with subsequent clinical deterioration. The patient's neurological status has improved slightly after receiving systemic methotrexate.

The patient is currently stable with the following vital signs:
- Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
- Heart rate: 53 bpm (normal range: 51-72 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 127/67 mmHg (normal range: 99/53-133/87 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 9 breaths per minute (normal range: 8-14 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on nasal cannula
- Heart rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- General: Alert and oriented, asleep but easily awakenable, makes eye contact, and answers most yes/no questions appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of left-sided brain cancer, likely primary CNS lymphoma. She presented with intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, resulting in clinical deterioration. The patient has shown slight improvement in neurological status following systemic methotrexate treatment. She is currently stable and being managed with medications such as steroids, mannitol, and isotonic IV fluids. The plan includes monitoring her neurological status, checking a repeat head CT scan, and assessing her MTX level. The patient also has conditions like hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and fever/neutropenia, for which appropriate medications are being administered. The patient's nutritional status is replete, and she is receiving 60 mL/hour of a 1.5 NS solution with 1 ampule of HCO3 at 150/hr. A 24-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance has been ordered. The patient has two lines for access, a PICC line and a peripheral IV line. The patient's code status is presumed full pending discussion with the family and healthcare provider."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with CNS involvement of lymphoma. She was admitted to the ICU with severely depressed mental status and unilateral CNS insult with significant cerebral edema. She is currently on primary treatment for lymphoma and supportive treatment for cerebral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lymphoma: The patient has CNS involvement with lymphoma, which is being treated with methotrexate (MTX). MTX toxicity can lead to bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, renal impairment, and neurotoxicity.
2. Cerebral Edema: The patient has significant cerebral edema. If not managed properly, it can lead to increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and death.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and if not managed appropriately, it can progress to coma or other neurological complications.
4. Seizure Prophylaxis: The patient is on seizure prophylaxis with Keppra. If this is not effective, the patient may develop seizures, which can complicate her condition.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression from chemotherapy. Infections can worsen the patient's overall condition.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility. If not prophylaxed against, DVT can lead to pulmonary embol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided brain cancer, likely primary CNS lymphoma. She is experiencing intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, which led to clinical deterioration. However, after receiving systemic MTX, her neurological status has improved slightly. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/76 mmHg to 131/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her weight is 94.3 kg, and she is 72 inches tall. The patient has received a total of 6,505 mL of fluids, with 1,348 mL given in the past 24 hours. She has had a blood product transfusion of 1,490 mL and has produced 5,750 mL of urine. The patient's neurological examination shows slight improvement. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Imaging shows a brain mass in the left lentiform nucleus with extensive vasogenic edema but no significant change since the previous CT scan. Microbiology tests have been negative for bacteria and fungus in the brain and blood cultures. The patient is currently on several medications, including mannitol, steroids, antibiotics, and seizure prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with CNS lymphoma and significant cerebral edema. She is currently undergoing treatment for lymphoma and acute management of cerebral edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure of 154/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and follows commands, but has diminished reflexes bilaterally. She has post-surgical changes and diminished breath sounds on respiratory examination. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. Imaging studies reveal no significant change in the head. The patient is receiving treatment for cerebral edema, including weaning off mannitol, and continues with chemotherapy for CNS lymphoma. She requires enteral access due to the risk of aspiration and will be monitored for glycemic control and potential bloodstream infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure leading to herniation due to uncontrolled cerebral edema.
2. Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and use of indwelling lines or catheters.
3. Aspiration pneumonia due to compromised respiratory function and risk of aspiration.
4. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy for glycemic control.
5. Bleeding complications due to low plate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of left-sided brain cancer, likely primary CNS lymphoma. She has experienced intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation with subsequent clinical deterioration. However, she is currently stable with slight improvement in neurological status after receiving systemic methotrexate (MTX).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's history of intracranial hypertension indicates a risk for increased ICP. This can lead to further neurological deterioration and potential brain herniation if not managed appropriately.
2. Seizures: The patient has been placed on keppra for seizure prophylaxis, indicating a concern for seizure activity. Brain tumors and associated edema can increase the risk of seizures.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and treatment may increase the risk of infections. Negative brain and blood cultures suggest no current infection, but urine culture is pending.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake and output discrepancy, indicating a potential fluid imbalance. Monitoring and adjustment of fluid administration are necessary to maintain electrolyte balance and prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or renal dysfunction.
5. Medication interactions: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including steroids, anticonvulsants, and antibiotics. Careful monitoring is required to assess for potential drug interactions and side effects.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of left-sided brain cancer, likely primary CNS lymphoma. The patient has experienced clinical deterioration due to intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation. However, the patient has shown improvement in neurological status after receiving systemic methotrexate (MTX).

The assessment and plan indicate the continuation of dexamethasone, mannitol, isotonic IV fluids, consideration of repeat head CT, monitoring of serial neuro exams, continuation of lisinopril for hypertension, statin for hyperlipidemia, and Dobhoff tube feeds. The patient is also prescribed keppra for seizure prophylaxis, and bactrim, protonix, and SQH are mentioned as part of the treatment plan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's brain cancer and subsequent intracranial hypertension put her at risk for increased intracranial pressure. This can lead to further neurological deterioration and potential herniation if not managed appropriately.

2. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to her brain tumor and the associated neurological changes. Keppra has been prescribed for seizure prophylaxis, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any seizure activity.

3. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state from systemic MTX, she is at an increased risk for infections."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided CNS lymphoma. The patient's condition is complicated by intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, which resulted in clinical deterioration. However, the patient's neurological status has been gradually improving with systemic methotrexate treatment.

The patient is currently on several medications, including steroids (decadron), mannitol, leucovorin, allopurinol, and NHCO3. The plan is to continue decadron, wean mannitol, and potentially discontinue IV fluids, leucovorin, and allopurinol once the 72-hour serum methotrexate concentration falls below 0.10. The patient is also on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient has been diagnosed with oral thrush, for which nystatin treatment is recommended. She is also being managed for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and an unspecified feeding/eating issue. The patient has peripheral venous catheter (PIV) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines for access.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 to 154/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient's neurological examination reveals mild weakness and numb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with CNS lymphoma and significant cerebral edema. She is currently on a mannitol taper and is showing improvement in mental alertness. The goal is to move to steroid therapy only. The patient has no known drug allergies and is unable to provide her own medical history due to encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's CNS lymphoma and cerebral edema put her at risk for increased intracranial pressure. This can lead to further deterioration in mental status, vision changes, and potentially herniation if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, which increases her risk for hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections. Proper infection control measures should be implemented, including elevating the head of bed (HOB) for VAP prevention and regular line checks.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low (246 K/uL), indicating a potential risk for bleeding. Close monitoring of any signs of bleeding and appropriate management should be done.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's sodium level is low (130 mEq/L), which can be a result of her cerebral edema. Regular electrolyte monitoring and correction as needed is essential.
5. Medication side effects: Some of the medications the patient is receiving, such as Decadron ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of left-sided CNS lymphoma and intracranial hypertension. She has shown neurological improvement on systemic methotrexate. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/73 to 150/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is awake, alert, and converses with brief responses. Physical examination reveals oral thrush, reactive pupils, regurgitant bradycardia, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows intact strength on the right side but absent ankle jerks and upgoing toe on the left side. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal range. The patient is being weaned off mannitol and may discontinue intravenous fluids once methotrexate clearance is confirmed. The plan includes continuing steroids, observing for signs of complications, and considering further treatment options."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided CNS lymphoma. She has been experiencing intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, leading to clinical deterioration. However, her neurological status has been improving on systemic methotrexate treatment. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications, including decadron, mannitol, methotrexate, leucovorin, allopurinol, and NHCO3. She also has oral thrush, for which nystatin is being administered. 

The patient has hypertension and is on lisinopril. She also has hyperlipidemia and is on a statin. The patient's feeding is through tube feeds, and she is being evaluated for fever and respiratory infection symptoms. She has two access lines, a PIV and a PICC line. 

The patient's code status is pending discussion with the family and healthcare providers. Her current disposition is to remain in the ICU until the mannitol taper is complete, after which she will be discharged to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hypertension: The patient's history of intracranial hypertension indicates a risk of increased pressure within the skull, which can cause neurological symptoms and complications.
2. Uncal herniation: The patient's condition of uncal herniation suggests a potential risk of brain tissue compression and compromise of vital brain structures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided CNS lymphoma.
- She experienced clinical deterioration due to intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, but her neurological status has been improving on systemic methotrexate.
- The patient has several medical conditions including CNS lymphoma, oral thrush, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and feeding/eating difficulties.
- She is currently receiving multiple medications such as decadron, mannitol, methotrexate, leucovorin, allopurinol, Niacin, keppra, lisinopril, lopressor, and statins.
- The patient has a PICC line and a PIV catheter for access.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7 C (98%), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/60-150/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient is being given keppra for seizure prophylaxis, indicating a risk of seizures due to her condition.
2. Oral Thrush: The patient is diagnosed with oral thrush and is prescribed nystatin. This suggests a risk of fungal infections.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension and is on lisinopril."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided CNS lymphoma, intracranial HTN, midline shift, and uncal herniation. She has shown clinical deterioration but is now showing improvement in neurological status with systemic methotrexate therapy. The patient's oral thrush needs to be treated with nystatin. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which require ongoing management. The patient is currently on tube feeds and needs a formal video swallow evaluation. She is also receiving prophylactic medications for seizures, stress ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis. Her blood glucose levels are being monitored and managed with regular insulin. The patient's lines include a PICC line and a peripheral IV line. Her code status is full code, and she will remain in the ICU until stable following the mannitol taper.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to her CNS lymphoma and intracranial HTN. Prophylactic medication has been started, but close monitoring is essential.
2. Infection: The patient has oral thrush, which needs to be treated with nystatin. She may also be at risk for other infections due to her immunocompromised state.
3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has had fluctuations in fluid balance, with a negative fluid balance of 933 mL over the past 24 hours. Close monitoring of her fluid status is important.
4. Neurological deterioration: Despite current improvement, the patient is at risk for further neurological deterioration due to her underlying condition. Regular neurologic exams are necessary.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that requires ongoing management with lisinopril and lopressor. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, and it is important to continue management with statin therapy.
7. Feeding difficulties: The patient is currently on tube feeds, and a formal video swallow evaluation is pending. There may be potential complications related to feeding, such as aspiration pneumonia.
8. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis, and prophylactic measures are in place. Regular assessment for signs of DVT is necessary.
9. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, and there is a potential for drug interactions. Close monitoring of her medication regimen is essential.
10. ICU-acquired complications: As the patient will be staying in the ICU, she is at risk for developing ICU-acquired complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections. Close monitoring and adherence to infection control practices are crucial."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided CNS lymphoma, intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation. She experienced clinical deterioration but is now showing gradual improvement with systemic methotrexate therapy. The patient has neurological exams steadily improving on MTX. She is currently being treated for oral thrush, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tube feeds due to feeding and swallowing difficulties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hypertension (IC HTN) - The patient has a history of IC HTN, which can lead to complications such as headaches, vision changes, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and seizures.
2. Uncal herniation - The patient had uncal herniation, which is a serious brain condition where brain tissue moves from its normal position and can compress vital structures, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential loss of consciousness or death if not treated promptly.
3. CNS lymphoma - The patient has left-sided CNS lymphoma, which can cause various neurological symptoms depending on the location and extent of the tumor. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, vision changes, weakness, numbness, and difficulty speaking or understanding speech.
4. Hypertension - The patient has hypertension, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems if not managed appropriately.
5. Hyperlipidemia - The patient also has hyperlipid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of CNS lymphoma and cerebral edema. She has been treated with MTX, Mannitol taper, and steroids. Her condition has been improving, but she is now experiencing increased agitation and confusion. The patient is currently on ICU care and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's worsening agitation and confusion could be a sign of an underlying infection. A pan CX to assess for infection is planned.
2. Metabolic or Steroid Psychosis: Given the recent increase in steroid use, it is possible that the patient's symptoms are due to toxic metabolic effects or steroid psychosis. Close monitoring and repeat head CT are recommended.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylactic SQ UF Heparin to prevent DVT. However, further evaluation and management may be required if there are any signs or symptoms suggestive of DVT.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her prolonged stay in the ICU. Proper respiratory support and hygiene practices should be maintained to prevent VAP.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy and steroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring for any signs of bleeding, such as melena or hematemesis, is essential.

Further evaluation and management are needed to address these"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with CNS lymphoma in the ICU for management of cerebral edema. She is currently being treated with MTX, Mannitol taper, and steroids. The patient's overall condition is improving, but she is experiencing increased agitation and confusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient has cerebral edema, which can potentially worsen and lead to increased intracranial pressure. This may require further interventions such as repeat head CT scans and adjustments in medication dosages.
2. CNS Lymphoma: The patient has CNS lymphoma, which is a type of cancer. It is important to monitor her response to chemotherapy and manage any side effects.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is an elevated white blood cell count. This may indicate an infection or a reaction to steroids.
4. Agitation and Confusion: The patient's increased agitation and confusion could be due to various factors, including toxic metabolic picture, steroid psychosis, or worsening cerebral edema. Close monitoring of her neurologic exam is necessary.
5. Infection: The patient's Pan CX should be assessed to rule out any infections, especially considering her immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy.
6. Nutritional Issues: The patient's TFs have been held since her NGT pulled out. She will need a video swallow study to determine if she can safely tolerate oral intake again."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of left-sided CNS lymphoma, who is currently in the ICU. She has experienced intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, leading to clinical deterioration. However, her neurological status has been gradually improving with systemic methotrexate therapy. She is also experiencing waxing and waning delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and disorientation indicate delirium, which can increase the risk of falls, self-injury, and worsening neurological condition.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high glucose levels suggest the possibility of hyperglycemia, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure readings may indicate hypotension, which can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count suggests thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding and hemorrhagic complications.
5. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxicity of medications, and decreased clearance of waste products.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The high lipid levels indicate hyperlipidemia, which is a risk factor for"

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided CNS lymphoma who experienced intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation resulting in clinical deterioration. She has been receiving systemic methotrexate therapy, which has led to gradual improvement in neurological status. However, she is also experiencing waxing and waning delirium for the past two days. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/73 mmHg to 146/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. She is hemodynamically stable.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 8.8 to 14.4 thousand cells/microliter, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values indicate possible electrolyte imbalances, such as low potassium, low magnesium, and low calcium levels. 

The patient has several medical conditions, including CNS lymphoma, delirium, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and feeding intolerance. She is being treated with vancomycin for possible central line-associated bloodstream infection, anticonvulsants, proton pump inhibitors, and steroids. 

The patient's physical examination reveals oral thrush, unequal pupil sizes, regenerative bradycardia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of left-sided CNS lymphoma, who presented with intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation. She experienced clinical deterioration but has shown gradual improvement in neurological status after receiving systemic methotrexate therapy. However, she has also been experiencing waxing and waning delirium for the past two days. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/73 mmHg to 146/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. She is alert and oriented, but demonstrates some neurological deficits including weakness on the right side, upgoing toe on the left side, and absent ankle jerks. The patient has oral thrush, which has been treated with nystatin. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is scheduled for a formal video swallow evaluation before starting tube feeds. The patient's laboratory values indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slightly low sodium and potassium levels. The assessment and plan include tapering steroids, continuing systemic methotrexate therapy, providing seizure prophylaxis with keppra, treating oral thrush with nystatin, managing hypertension with lisinop"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of left-sided CNS lymphoma. She presented with intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation, resulting in clinical deterioration. However, her neurological status has been gradually improving with systemic methotrexate therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to CNS lymphoma and potential complications such as herniation.
2. Infection, specifically oral thrush, which may be due to immunosuppressive therapy.
3. Hypertension, for which the patient is already on lisinopril and receiving additional doses of loperamide IV for blood pressure control.
4. Hyperlipidemia, which requires ongoing management with statin therapy.
5. Feeding difficulties, as indicated by the need for tube feeds and a planned video swallow evaluation.
6. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
7. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly given the patient's critical condition.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
9. Potential complications related to methotrexate therapy, such as myelosuppression and hepatic toxicity.
10. Risk of seizure activity, for which the patient is on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with CNS lymphoma in the ICU for management of cerebral edema. The patient has been treated with MTX and steroids and is showing overall clinical improvement. However, she remains agitated and confused. The patient also has one blood culture positive with vancomycin started and remains afebrile with stable white blood cell count.

The primary issues include CNS lymphoma, cerebral edema, bacteremia, leukocytosis, and nutrition. The patient's current plan includes continuing Decadron (tapering to 6 q6), repeating head CT with some improvement in edema, neuro checks, Bactrim for PCP while on steroids, and continuing vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cerebral edema leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain herniation. There is also a risk of infection due to the patient being on immunosuppressive therapy (steroids and chemotherapy). Additionally, the patient's agitation and confusion could progress to severe delirium or seizures. Monitoring the patient closely for any changes in mental status, neurologic examination findings, and vital signs is crucial."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with CNS lymphoma in the ICU for management of cerebral edema. The patient is currently being treated with MTX (methotrexate) and steroids. She is overall clinically improving but remains agitated and confused. The patient has one blood culture positive with vancomycin started, and she remains alert and oriented with stable white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CNS Lymphoma - The patient's primary issue is CNS lymphoma, for which she is receiving treatment with MTX and steroids. Monitoring liver function tests is important as MTX can cause liver toxicity.

2. Cerebral Edema - The patient has cerebral edema, which is improving with repeated head CT scans. Decadron, a steroid, is being continued at 6 mg every 6 hours. Mannitol has been stopped, and the patient will continue to have neuro checks.

3. Bacteremia - The patient has bacteremia, and final speciation from blood cultures is pending. Since only one bottle is positive and the patient has a PICC line, it is important to consider discontinuing the PICC line and going on line holiday if the bacteria is identified as one that does not require continued access.

4. Leukocytosis - The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to steroids or possible infection. Lower clinical suspicion points towards steroid-induced leukocytosis. Further follow-up of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided CNS lymphoma, intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation. She experienced clinical deterioration but has been showing gradual neurological improvement with systemic methotrexate therapy. However, she is currently experiencing delirium. The patient's blood culture showed growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Her urine culture revealed the presence of Corynebacterium species. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and will continue to receive it until the organism is identified. The patient's steroids are being tapered as well. Other ongoing plans include tube feeds until a video swallow evaluation, continuation of lisinopril for hypertension, and management of hyperlipidemia. The patient is also on various medications for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma: The patient's primary condition poses a risk for further neurological deterioration or recurrence of symptoms such as intracranial hypertension and midline shift.
2. Infection: The presence of Gram-positive cocci in the blood culture and Corynebacterium species in the urine culture suggests a potential bacterial infection. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to sepsis or worsening of the patient's condition.
3. Delirium: The patient's recent onset of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with left-sided CNS lymphoma, intracranial hypertension, midline shift, and uncal herniation. She has experienced clinical deterioration but is now showing gradual neurological improvement with systemic methotrexate therapy. However, she is currently experiencing delirium for the past two days. The patient has an active infection indicated by positive blood cultures for GPC, which could potentially be a contaminant or a true pathogen. She also has a positive urine culture for Corynebacterium species, but this is likely a contaminant and will not be treated at this time. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is receiving various medications including vancomycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. Her lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid. Imaging shows improvement in mass effect related to known left frontal lymphoma, with slightly decreased shift of midline structures to the right and decreased left subfalcine herniation. However, there is persistent trapping of the right lateral ventricle, and slight dilatation of the temporal lobe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's recent episodes of delirium need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately. It is important to differentiate between toxic encephalopathy and steroid psychosis as potential causes.
2. Bacteremia: The positive blood cultures for GPC raise concern for a potential bloodstream infection. Further evaluation and appropriate treatment should be initiated based on the results of the blood cultures.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: Although the urine culture grew Corynebacterium species, it is likely a contaminant and may not require treatment. However, close monitoring is necessary.
4. Hyperglycemia: The elevated glucose levels indicate possible hyperglycemia. Tight glycemic control should be maintained to prevent complications.
5. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's increasing episodes of tachycardia associated with agitation need to be addressed. The addition of metoprolol and adjustment of lisinopril dosage may help manage these symptoms.
6. Weakness/Deconditioning: The patient's weakness and deconditioning state should be evaluated by a physical therapist to develop an appropriate rehabilitation plan.
7. Oral Thrush: The presence of oral thrush should be managed with antifungal medication such as nystatin.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's elevated lipid levels should be monitored and managed with statin therapy.
9. Intracranial Pressure: The patient's intracranial pressure should continue to be closely monitored due to her history of intracranial hypertension and herniation. Adjustments in medication and further interventions may be necessary to prevent complications related to increased intracranial pressure."

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a diagnosis of CNS lymphoma and cerebral edema. She has been receiving treatment with mannitol and Decadron for the cerebral edema, which has shown improvement in the midline shift on CT scan. The patient is also on MTX therapy for her cancer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's cerebral edema and lymphoma may increase the pressure inside the skull, leading to raised ICP. This can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and potentially herniation if not managed properly.

2. Infection: The patient is on immunosuppressive therapy (MTX) and has been given vancomycin due to an altered mental status. This suggests a concern for possible infections, including hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Monitoring of vital signs, chest x-rays, and appropriate cultures can help identify any infections early on.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has prophylaxis for DVT with subcutaneous UF heparin. While on bed rest in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like pantoprazole or stress ulcer prophylaxis can"
