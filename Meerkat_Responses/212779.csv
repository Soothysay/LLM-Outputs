   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and primary lung pathology with
   hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc). Patient  has no signs or sx
   concerning for intracranial disease.   Over-medication or overdose is
   also possible, but pt denies, and lithium and valproate both negative.
   However, valproic acid can sometimes cause hyperammonemia.  She does
   have recent changes in psych meds that could be sedating. NMS or
   serotonin syndrome can also present with sedatio`n but appears unlikely
   w/o myoclonus, rigidity or fever.   Doing well with pressure support
   - extubate today, with anaesthesia and cart present
   - repeat ABG
   - urine tox
   -hold psych meds for now, but consider re-starting after extubation and
   pt is stable
   # hx PE: INR therapeutic
   - Check INR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), and recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/68 mmHg to 157/126 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on invasive ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and pressure support (PS) at 15 cmH2O.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the abdominal pain, which is described as tenderness in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) and pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ). The physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, clear breath sounds bilaterally, warmth and well-perfused skin, and neurologic function within normal limits.

Laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic pain and acute pain, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and placed on CPAP overnight. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-152/34-44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP and has an RSBI of 94. His physical examination is largely unremarkable, except for not being assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status. Laboratory results show normal WBC count, Hct, Plt, Cr, TropT, TCO2, and other lab values within normal range. The patient's pain control and glycemic control are being monitored. The patient is at risk for complications such as DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP due to prolonged ICU stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU.
2. Stress Ulcers: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of certain medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is currently on CPAP support. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the given information include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This condition refers to an excessive buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood due to inadequate ventilation. It can be caused by respiratory muscle weakness, airway obstruction, or decreased respiratory drive.

2. Intracranial pathology: Although the patient does not show signs or symptoms concerning for intracranial disease, it is important to consider this possibility as it can contribute to respiratory failure.

3. Primary lung pathology: The patient's history of asthma increases the risk of primary lung pathology, such as exacerbation of asthma leading to hypoventilation.

4. Over-medication or overdose: The patient has recent changes in psych medications that could be sedating. Over-medication or overdose may present with sedation and respiratory depression.

5. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome: These conditions can present with sedation and respiratory depression, but they are less likely without the presence of myoclonus, rigidity, or fever.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes mild desaturation and clear breath sounds bilaterally. Her vital signs are stable, and she is responsive to voice commands. She has tenderness in the left upper quadrant of her abdomen and pain in the right upper quadrant. The patient's lab results show normal WBC count, Hct, and platelet levels. However, her PT/PTT/INR values are elevated, and her TCO2 level is slightly below the normal range. The assessment and plan include continuing non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night, oxygen by nasal cannula as necessary, citalopram for bipolar disorder, holding depakote and abilify, ortho follow-up for finger dislocation, prophylaxis with PPI and sc heparin, bowel regimen, considering a nutrition consult, and monitoring access with PIVs. The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is called out to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could be due to hypoventilation caused by factors such as obesity, asthma, or medication overdose. Close monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old woman with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who was admitted with chest pain. She developed coagulant-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, which has been treated and cleared. The patient then became unresponsive with a high pCO2 level of 120 and was intubated. She was extubated yesterday and has been doing well. She slept with CPAP overnight.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, Haldol, Compazine, Desipramine, Chlorpromazine, Imipramine, Zoloft, shellfish, and unknown reactions to several medications.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/72 to 173/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 64 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 158.

Physical examination reveals that she is overweight/obese, with clear breath sounds and diminished pulses in her distal extremities. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. Her labs show"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated but experiences desaturation and requires non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night, and O2 by nasal cannula as necessary. She has a history of bipolar disorder, abdominal pain that has resolved, and a finger dislocation that was reduced and splinted. She is currently on several medications including citalopram, PPI, sc heparin, and a bowel regimen. The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hypoventilation caused by obstructive lung disease, obesity, or psychiatric medication overdose. The patient may require continuous monitoring of her oxygen saturation levels and respiratory function.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT/PE, which increases her risk of developing another clot in the ICU. She should be monitored for signs of DVT/PE, such as leg swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturation.

   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Patient  has no signs or sx concerning for intracranial disease.
   Over-medication or overdose is also possible, but pt denies, and
   lithium and valproate both negative.  Extubated well, only mild
   desaturation likely [**3-13**] habitus, obstructive disease, and
   hypoventilation.  Did well with CPAP overnight night of [**11-5**].
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   She refused CPAP overnight and was placed on 2L NC with rousing by
   nursing staff when her O2 sats dipped below the upper 80
s.  At ~0530
   she briefly desatted to mid 70
s and CPAP mask was placed on her face
   as she continued sleeping.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has been experiencing various medical complications and issues, including:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is suspected to have hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be caused by factors such as respiratory drive from intracranial pathology, new psychiatric medication regimen, primary lung pathology (e.g., asthma, COPD), or hypoventilation. The patient denies overdose and both lithium and valproate tests were negative. The patient's desaturation during extubation may be due to habitus, obstructive disease, and hypoventilation.

2. Psychiatric issues/bipolar/borderline personality disorder: The patient shows limited insight into her medical condition, specifically obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the danger of low oxygen saturation levels. She refuses CPAP treatment but does not want to die. The patient has a history of splitting and trying to make deals with the medical team.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, but it has since resolved, with negative liver function tests (LFTs), amylase, and lipase results.

4. Finger dislocation: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old woman with morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation, severe depression, and a history of suicide attempts. She presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and required invasive ventilation. She was agitated and asked for Ambien, leading to a code purple call and her return to the MICU. She was started on Abilify (Aripiprazole) for agitation. The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, haloperidol, prochlorperazine, desipramine, chlorpromazine, imipramine, sertraline, and shellfish-derived products. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/59 mmHg to 174/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on CPAP. She is on various medications, including atrovent, flovent, citalopram, valproate, and Abilify. 

24-hour events include the placement and removal of a PICC line, as well as the discontinuation of invasive ventilation. The patient received infusions and other ICU medications. Her medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for agitation and a recent increase in blood glucose levels. The flow sheet shows a fluid balance of -253 mL, and respiratory support with CPAP mask, with an SpO2 of 95% and ABG results of pH 7.39, PaCO2 66, PaO2 67, and HCO3-"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old woman with morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation, severe depression, and a history of suicide attempts. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and agitation. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, certain psychiatric medications, and shellfish. 

The patient has been started on Abilify (an antipsychotic medication) and is also taking other medications including Celexa, valproate, flovent, atrovent, and Zoloft. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/59 to 174/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on CPAP. The patient is on invasive ventilation, which was stopped briefly but then restarted. 

The physical examination reveals clear oropharynx, no cervical lymphadenopathy, clear lung sounds, regular heart sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and diminished radial and dorsalis pulses on the right side. 

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, platelet count of 259, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low sodium and potassium levels. Other lab results are within normal ranges. 

The patient has been monitored closely with frequent assessments of vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitated her admission to the ICU and invasive ventilation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory parameters will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Agitation: The patient's agitation requires careful management to prevent complications such as self-injury or interference with medical interventions. Collaboration with the psychiatric team will be essential for optimizing her agitation management and ensuring a safe transition to less restrictive settings.

3. Allergic Reactions: Given the patient's known allergies, it is crucial to avoid exposure to allergenic substances, especially penicillins and certain psychiatric medications.

4. Infection Risk: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase her risk of developing healthcare-associated infections. Close monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and other signs of infection will be necessary.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and obesity are risk factors for DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered to prevent DVT.

6. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient's obesity and immobility, she is at an increased risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments"

   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Wore CPAP
   for ~2 hours last night.  Did receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory
   status will not change while in hospital and is not likely going to
   improve if patient does not wear CPAP at home.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   - pt cleared medical for discharge
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt to
   be have capacity at that time to make medical decisions
   - discuss with psych regarding patient
s medical decision-making
   capacity

","The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status will not improve unless she wears CPAP at home. She is currently on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night and O2 by nasal canula as necessary.

The patient has limited insight into her medical condition of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the danger of low oxygen saturation levels. She refuses to wear CPAP, but also does not want to die. She has difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts to explain. The patient has a history of splitting and trying to strike deals with the medical team. She was evaluated during a code purple and was felt to have capacity at that time to make medical decisions.

The patient has resolved abdominal pain, negative liver function tests (LFTs), amylase, and lipase. She has a dislocated finger which has been reduced and splinted. She is being managed with Tylenol and Percocet as needed for pain. She will need a follow-up appointment with orthopedics two weeks after [**2156-12-6**].

The patient is receiving prophylactic medications including a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), subcutaneous heparin, and a bowel regimen"

   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Wore CPAP
   for ~2 hours last night.  Did receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory
   status will not change while in hospital and is not likely going to
   improve if patient does not wear CPAP at home.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   - pt cleared medical for discharge
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt to
   be have capacity at that time to make medical decisions
   - discuss with psych regarding patient

","The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been transferred to the floor but unable to stay secondary to agitation. She has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP. The patient's respiratory status will not change while in the hospital and is not likely going to improve if the patient does not wear CPAP at home.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is already present and could worsen if the patient does not wear CPAP at home.
2. Respiratory drive from intracranial pathology: This should be considered if there are any signs of neurological issues.
3. New psychiatric medication regimen: The patient's psychiatric condition may affect her response to certain medications.
4. Primary lung pathology with hypoventilation: Conditions like asthma or COPD could contribute to the patient's respiratory failure.
5. Dislocated finger: The patient had a left digit dislocation that has been reduced and splinted. Proper pain management and follow-up with orthopedics are essential.
6. Abdominal pain: The patient previously experienced abdominal pain, but it has resolved. It is important to monitor for any recurrence.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been transferred to the floor but unable to stay due to agitation. She received Ambien and continues to refuse CPAP but also does not want to die. The patient has limited insight into her medical condition of obstructive sleep apnea and the danger of low oxygen saturation levels. She is being evaluated for medical decision-making capacity and potential placement in a psychiatric facility. The patient also has abdominal pain, which has resolved, and a finger dislocation that was reduced and splinted. She is on prophylactic medications for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's glycemic control and nutrition are being monitored, and she has multiple IV lines in place. Her code status is full code, and her disposition is pending a psychiatric evaluation, as she does not want to return home. Discussions with case management are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of asthma and hypercarbic respiratory failure puts her at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.
2. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia increases her risk of developing further infections, such"

   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Alkalemic respiratory failure: Etiology of events leading to
   alkalemia and intubation last night are not clear, however, it is
   likely that the patient was having a seizure at the time given her
   downward deviated eyes.  However, seizure prophylaxis would be
   difficult given the number if different medications that the patient is
   already on.  Head CT without contrast unremarkable.  Neuro is
   following, appreciate their recs.
   - EEG
 possibly set-up while patient is sedated then plan to stop
   fentanyl & propofol and extubate patient for better study
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Attempt to wean from vent & extubate today
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Did

   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt to
   be have capacity at that time to make medical decisions.  Patient has
   intermittently been refusing her psychiatric meds.  She did accept
   these medicines early yesterday afternoon.  Most of them are not
   crushable and thus she cannot receive them while intubated.
   - discuss with psych regarding patient

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She had an alkaline respiratory failure, and a head CT showed no acute findings. She is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and has been refusing psychiatric medications intermittently. She is also refusing to wear CPAP at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of asthma, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and refusal to wear CPAP at home indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing new infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of DVT/PE puts her at risk for developing further thrombotic events.
4. Psychiatric complications: The patient's psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, may lead to complications such as agitation, refusal of treatment, and difficulty in making informed medical decisions.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's obesity and possible limited mobility increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, especially if she is not receiving adequate nutrition while in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Alkalemic respiratory failure: Etiology of events leading to
   alkalemia and intubation last night are not clear, however, it is
   likely that the patient was having a seizure at the time given her
   downward deviated eyes.  However, seizure prophylaxis would be
   difficult given the number if different medications that the patient is
   already on.  Head CT without contrast unremarkable.  Neuro is
   following, appreciate their recs.
   - EEG
 possibly set-up while patient is sedated then plan to stop
   fentanyl & propofol and extubate patient for better study
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Attempt to wean from vent & extubate today
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Did
   receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory status will not change while in
   hospital and is not likely going to improve if patient does not wear
   CPAP at home.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt to
   be have capacity at that time to make medical decisions.  Patient has
   intermittently been refusing her psychiatric meds.  She did accept
   these medicines early yesterday afternoon.  Most of them are not
   crushable and thus she cannot receive them while intubated.
   - discuss with psych regarding patient
s medical decision-making
   capacity
   - discuss placement with psych
   - cont all psyche meds (citalopram, depakote, and abilify, etc.)
   # abd pain- Has resolved, negative LFTs, amylase, and lipase
   .
   # Finger dislocation: s/p reducation and splinting.
   - ortho following; pt. needs follow-up appointment with them 2 weeks
   after [**2156-12-6**].
   - pain management with Tylenol, percocet PRN
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel regimen, therapeutic on coumadin
 holding
   coumadin for INR of 3.1
   .
   #) FEN:  regular foods when extubated; holding TF in anticipation of
   extubation later today
   - consider nutrition consult
   .
   #) Access: PIVs
   .
   #) Code Status: Full
   .
   #) Dispo: pending psych eval, pt does not want to return home.
   Continuing discussions with case management regarding safe placement
   for patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes an altered mental status, difficulty following commands, and limited insight into her medical condition. She has been extubated successfully and is tolerating facemask CPAP before switching to nasal CPAP for the night. The patient spiked a fever, and blood cultures were ordered. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate between 86-134 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 to 92/21 mmHg, respiratory rate between 18-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is on multiple medications including Ambien, Percocet, and various psychiatric medications. She has a history of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for pain in the right upper quadrant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a concern for ongoing respiratory issues such as hypoventilation or inadequate oxygenation. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and oxygen saturation is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever, and blood cultures were ordered. This indicates a potential bacterial infection, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/PE, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Alkalemic respiratory failure: Etiology of events leading to
   alkalemia and intubation on [**11-13**] are not clear.  Patient was
   successfully extubated yesterday.  Neuro does not feel that the patient
   had a seizure.  Their recommendation is for head and neck CT based on
   PE & subjective complaints of patient, however, her subjective
   complaints are quite variable.  Head & neck CT not performed last night
   secondary to patient agitation.  Would appreciate if neuro could
   re-examine patient today to decide whether these studies are truly
   necessary.  Patient
s symptoms and respiratory issues may be, in part,
   secondary to her psychotropic medications.
   - EEG
 awaiting results of study
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Did
   receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory status will not change while in
   hospital and is not likely going to improve if patient does not wear
   CPAP at home.  Patient continues to intermittently refuse to wear CPAP.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt not
   to have capacity at that time to make medical decisions.  Patient has
   intermittently been refusing her psychiatric meds.  She did take most
   of her medications last night, but routinely refuses her morning
   depakote dose and is only taking it at night.  Ongoing concern that her
   psychiatric regimen may be contributing to her respiratory issues.
   - discuss with psych patient
s medication regimen and whether meds can
   be further streamlined
   - discuss with psych regarding patient
s medical decision-making
   capacity
   - discuss placement with psych
   - cont all psych meds for now (citalopram, depakote, and abilify, etc.)
   .
   # abd pain- Has resolved, negative LFTs, amylase, and lipase
   .
   # Finger dislocation: s/p reducation and splinting.
   - ortho following; pt. needs follow-up appointment with them 2 weeks
   after [**2156-12-6**].
   - pain management with Tylenol, percocet PRN
   .
   # Chest pain
 likely related to anxiety and shortness of breath.  Do
   not feel that it is cardiac in origin or that any kind of stress test
   or cardiac imaging is clinically indicated.  Dobutamine and p-MIBI
   studies would be limited secondary to body habitus.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: bowel regimen; holding coumadin for INR of 3.4
   .
   #) FEN:  regular diet
   .
   #) Access: PIVs
   .
   #) Code Status: Full
   .
   #) Dispo: Trying to place at [**Hospital1 **].    Patient is not safe to return
   home.
