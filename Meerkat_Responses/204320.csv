   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 75 year old female with history of recurrent drug-resistant
   UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis who is
   admitted from an OSH with altered mental status, hypothermia and
   presumed sepsis.
   Plan:
   # Presumed sepsis: Likely sources are sputum growing GPCs, urine
   culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000 colonies), all at
   OSH.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase in cortisol level.
   - PICC line, triple lumen in place from OSH- needs to be replaced or
   moved centrally via fluoroscopy
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12 off PICC, check ScVO2
   - Transfuse for Hct > 25
   - CXR here, review films from OSH
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr,
   wean levophed for now as CVP 16, MAP> 65 at this time
   - Broad spectrum abx including vanc, zosyn, flagyl
   - Will obtain DIC panel and LFTs for signs of end-organ damage.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Will resend the above, and stool cultures for C. diff
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - No indication for stress dose steroids, though these had been started
   at OSH, can reconsider if persistently hypotensive
   - Can discuss abx choice with ID in am as patient is followed as
   outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7384**].
   .
   # AMS: Appears to be improving. Patient can open eyes spontaneously.
   Had Neuro consult at OSH, ruled out myxedema given thyroid disease, MRI
   unremarkable.  CT head negative for bleed.  Most likely
   multifactorial.  Low index of suspician for CNS infection given
   presentation and imaging.
   - Continue to follow mental status
   - Will review MRI with radiology
   - Avoid sedating meds if possible
   - Consider Haldol prn agitation, propofol if sedation needed
   # Neck fullness: Differential includes edema or hemorrhage possible due
   to hx of thyroid surgery.
   - Will obtain head and neck CT to evaluate.
   .
   # Stage V CKD: Followed by transplant surgery as outpatient.  Had plan
   for AVF placement on [**1-7**] but postponed due to recurrent
   UTI/urosepsis.  Has not needed urgent HD to date.
   - Renal consult for recommendations on inpatient management, ?of
   initiating HD/CVVHD, though does not appear to have indication at this
   time
   - Renally dose all meds, follow vanc level
   - Continue outpatient meds including phoslo, epo (will clarify dose).
   Will hold on iron supplementation as NPO for now.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 7385**].  Admit platelet count to OSH
   was within normal limits, HIT ab negative. Likely medication induced
   versus critical illness effect.
   - Will give DDAVP to mobilize vWF and increase ability for hemostasis
   - Send smear
   - Stop all potential exacerbating drugs
   - If continues to fall, will call heme consult
   .
   # PTT coagulopathy: Increased out of proportion to the rest of
   coagulation profile.  [**Month (only) 60**] be related to critical illness.  Got FFP at
   OSH today.  PTT up to 100s at OSH.
   - Check APLA, lupus anticoagulant (pending)
   - Will check mixing studies to rule out acquired factor deficiency
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Anemia: Drop in hematocrit of uncertain origin. No obvious source of
   bleed. ?GI bleed due to Guiac positive stool, though no frank blood in
   ileostomy bag or on other sources of bleeding. Chronic, macrocytic, due
   to ESRD and B12 deficiency. Baseline around 25.
   - Will obtain head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans to rule
   out occult sources of bleeding.
   - Received 1 unit PRBC
   - Serial hematocrits q4 hours with goal > 25
   - Continue procrit q Sunday
   - Maintain active T&S
   - B12 injections Q month
   - Holding iron supplementation as above
   .
   # Bradycardia: History of CAD, no MI, last ECHO [**2138-3-7**].  Has
   low voltage on ECG from OSH today as well, and given low albumin,
   concerning for pericardial effusion.
   - Repeat ECHO here today
   - Repeat ECG
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency: Continue outpatient wound
   care. Wound care consult placed for further recommendations.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given
   sepsis/hypotension. Not currently on pressors.
   .
   # UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy: Ostomy care
   .
   # FEN: Nutrition consult placed for TF recommendations, No longer on
   pressors, so patient can be fed.  Can consider TPN given IBD and watery
   diarrhea. IVF as above to maintain MAP and UOP. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   # Access: Triple lumen PICC. Not currently centrally located but will
   be advanced/ replaced this morning.
   .
   # PPx: Holding DVT ppx given lower extremity skin breakdown and low
   platelets, PPI, VAP ppx, HOB > 30 degrees
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: OG tube in place. Will require tube feedings

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of recurrent drug-resistant urinary tract infections, end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypothermia, and presumed sepsis. The patient has multiple medical complications including anemia, bradycardia, chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency, hypertension, hypotension, PTT coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and stage V chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Presumed sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, hypothermia, and low blood pressure suggest a possible severe infection (sepsis). The sources of infection could be sputum growing Gram-positive cocci, urine culture growing Pseudomonas, or other sources at the outside hospital.

2. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's mental status is improving, but it is important to continue monitoring and evaluating her condition. Imaging studies such as MRI have been ruled out, and multifactorial causes are being considered.

3. Neck fullness: There is a heterogeneous mass palpable in the anterior neck without discoloration or pitting. This could be due to edema or hemorrhage, possibly related to a history of thyroid surgery. A head and neck CT scan is recommended to evaluate this further.

4. Stage V CKD (Ch"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 75 year old female with history of recurrent drug-resistant
   UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis who is
   admitted from an OSH with altered mental status, hypothermia and
   presumed sepsis.
   Plan:
   # Presumed sepsis: Likely sources are sputum growing GPCs, urine
   culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000 colonies), all at
   OSH.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase in cortisol level.
   - PICC line, triple lumen in place from OSH- needs to be replaced or
   moved centrally via fluoroscopy
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12 off PICC, check ScVO2
   - Transfuse for Hct > 25
   - CXR here, review films from OSH
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr,
   wean levophed for now as CVP 16, MAP> 65 at this time
   - Broad spectrum abx including vanc, zosyn, flagyl
   - Will obtain DIC panel and LFTs for signs of end-organ damage.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Will resend the above, and stool cultures for C. diff
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - No indication for stress dose steroids, though these had been started
   at OSH, can reconsider if persistently hypotensive
   - Can discuss abx choice with ID in am as patient is followed as
   outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7384**].
   .
   # AMS: Appears to be improving. Patient can open eyes spontaneously.
   Had Neuro consult at OSH, ruled out myxedema given thyroid disease, MRI
   unremarkable.  CT head negative for bleed.  Most likely
   multifactorial.  Low index of suspician for CNS infection given
   presentation and imaging.
   - Continue to follow mental status
   - Will review MRI with radiology
   - Avoid sedating meds if possible
   - Consider Haldol prn agitation, propofol if sedation needed
   # Neck fullness: Differential includes edema or hemorrhage possible due
   to hx of thyroid surgery.
   - Will obtain head and neck CT to evaluate.
   .
   # Stage V CKD: Followed by transplant surgery as outpatient.  Had plan
   for AVF placement on [**1-7**] but postponed due to recurrent
   UTI/urosepsis.  Has not needed urgent HD to date.
   - Renal consult for recommendations on inpatient management, ?of
   initiating HD/CVVHD, though does not appear to have indication at this
   time
   - Renally dose all meds, follow vanc level
   - Continue outpatient meds including phoslo, epo (will clarify dose).
   Will hold on iron supplementation as NPO for now.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 7385**].  Admit platelet count to OSH
   was within normal limits, HIT ab negative. Likely medication induced
   versus critical illness effect.
   - Will give DDAVP to mobilize vWF and increase ability for hemostasis
   - Send smear
   - Stop all potential exacerbating drugs
   - If continues to fall, will call heme consult
   .
   # PTT coagulopathy: Increased out of proportion to the rest of
   coagulation profile.  [**Month (only) 60**] be related to critical illness.  Got FFP at
   OSH today.  PTT up to 100s at OSH.
   - Check APLA, lupus anticoagulant (pending)
   - Will check mixing studies to rule out acquired factor deficiency
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Anemia: Drop in hematocrit of uncertain origin. No obvious source of
   bleed. ?GI bleed due to Guiac positive stool, though no frank blood in
   ileostomy bag or on other sources of bleeding. Chronic, macrocytic, due
   to ESRD and B12 deficiency. Baseline around 25.
   - Will obtain head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans to rule
   out occult sources of bleeding.
   - Received 1 unit PRBC
   - Serial hematocrits q4 hours with goal > 25
   - Continue procrit q Sunday
   - Maintain active T&S
   - B12 injections Q month
   - Holding iron supplementation as above

   # Bradycardia: History of CAD, no MI, last ECHO [**2138-3-7**].  Has
   low voltage on ECG from OSH today as well, and given low albumin,
   concerning for pericardial effusion.
   - Repeat ECHO here today
   - Repeat ECG
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency: Continue outpatient wound
   care. Wound care consult placed for further recommendations.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given
   sepsis/hypotension. Not currently on pressors.
   .
   # UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy: Ostomy care

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of recurrent drug-resistant UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN, and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypothermia, and presumed sepsis. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. She has bilateral pleural effusions and infiltrates in the right and left lobes on chest X-ray. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. Her labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24.4 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 21.5%, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 45 K/uL. She has a prolonged PTT but normal PT/INR. She also has elevated lactic acid levels and low magnesium and potassium levels. The patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for GPCs in the sputum and pseudomonas in the urine. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.

2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of recurrent drug-resistant UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN, and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis. She was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department with altered mental status, hypothermia, and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a low heart rate and low blood pressure. She has several medical complications including sepsis, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, PTT coagulopathy, anemia, bradycardia, chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency, hypertension, UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with hypothermia, elevated WBC, and likely sources of infection are sputum growing GPCs, urine culture growing pseudomonas. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further cultures are pending.
2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient appears to be improving, but a neuroconsult has been obtained to rule out myxedema coma, and an MRI was unremarkable. Low index of suspicion for CNS infection given presentation and imaging.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear cause, but platelet count was within normal limits at OSH,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The note mentions possible sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, anemia, isolated elevated PTT, severe malnutrition, acute on chronic renal failure, bradycardia, neck fullness, and a grave prognosis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient may develop further signs of infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), leading to septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemia and the presence of pulmonary edema.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may lead to bleeding complications or the need for platelet transfusion.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, requiring dialysis or other renal replacement therapies.
5. Malnutrition: Severe malnutrition may contribute to delayed wound healing, infections, and impaired immune response.
6. Bradycardia: The underlying cause of the bradycardia should be investigated and treated appropriately.
7. Neck fullness: Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of neck fullness and its potential impact on"

5. Isolated Elevated PTT: The patient has an isolated prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

6. Severe Malnutrition: The patient is severely malnourished, as reported by the family. Nutritional support is necessary.

7. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure superimposed on chronic renal failure. Renal replacement therapy may be required.

8. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient has bradycardia, which could be related to prior hypothermia.

   TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status/ Possible sepsis
   24 Hour Events:
   - CT torso (prelim) showed: Large bilateral pleural effusions with
   complete left lower lobe collapse and near complete right lower lobe
   collapse. No RP bleed.
   - CT neck/head showed: No focal fluid collection is seen in the neck.
   Mild stranding of the soft fat is identified bilaterally. Degenerative
   changes are seen in the cervical spine. Opacity seen in partially
   visualized right upper lung, for which correlation with torso CT is
   recommended. No acute intracranial abnormalities or hemorrhage. Sinus
   fluid level and soft tissue changes could be related to intubation but
   clinical correlation recommended.
   - She was transfused with 1 unit of PRBC for a Hct of 21.5 in the am
   and bumped her Hct to 25.0.
   - Fe studies returned at Fe 122, TIBC 138, ferritin 402, and TRF of
   106.  DIC labs were negative.  LFTs WNL.
   - TTE showed: Mild symmetric LVH with EF>55%. Suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Pleural effusions.
   - PICC was pulled back, however CXR showed it may still cannulate in
   the azygous, will recheck placement on CXR in the am.
   - OSH Cx checked, BCx [**2-9**] NGTD, UCx [**2-9**] 40,000 Pseudomonas sensitive to
   ceftaz, gent, and pip-tazo, BCx [**2-10**] NGTD, Sputum Cx [**2-11**] pending
   - Renal recs: Attg thinks her decreased mental status is due to uremia,
   if no other cause is identified would recommend dialyzing her.
   - C.diff and stool Cx pending.
   - DDAVP given x 1 for uremic platlets.
   - UCx from [**2-11**] grew yeast so her foley was changed.
   - Nutrition consult recommended tube feedings with Novasource Renal-

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Assessment: 75 year old female with history of recurrent drug-resistant
   UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis who is
   admitted from an OSH with altered mental status, hypothermia and
   presumed sepsis.
   # UTI/ Presumed sepsis: Likely sources are sputum growing GPCs, urine
   culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000 colonies), all at
   OSH.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase in cortisol level. DIC
   panel negative
   - PICC line, triple lumen in place from OSH- needs to be replaced or
   moved centrally via fluoroscopy
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12 off PICC, check ScVO2
   - Transfuse for Hct > 25, checking q6 hematocrits
   - Broad spectrum abx including vanc, zosyn, flagyl
 for coverage of
   known pseudomasl UTI (zosyn) and vanc for GPC
s, flagyl for empiric C.
   diff coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Patient is followed as outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7384**] (ID)
 will contact
   # AMS: Appears to be improving, eyes intermittently open though she
   does not open eyes to command, but withdraws from pain. Had Neuro
   consult at OSH, ruled out myxedema given thyroid disease, MRI
   unremarkable.  CT head negative for bleed.  Renal consult believes
   uremia could be the cause- patient is to be dialyzed today after line
   placement with IR, so will assess response. Most likely
   multifactorial.  Low index of suspician for CNS infection given
   presentation and imaging, no LP for now.  Other causes could include
   sub-clinical seizure.
   - Continue to follow mental status
   - Will obtain EEG to rule out seizure activity
   - Hemodialysis today after catheter placement by IR.
   - Avoid sedating meds if possible
   - Consider Haldol prn agitation, propofol if sedation needed
   #Hypernatremia: 146 this morning. Likely secondary to large amounts of
   saline given IV
   - Increase free water boluses to 250 mL q8 hours
   - trend
   # Stage V CKD: Followed by transplant surgery as outpatient.  Had plan
   for AVF placement on [**1-7**] but postponed due to recurrent
   UTI/urosepsis.  Has not needed urgent HD to date.   Per renal c/s,
   possible cause of AMS is uremia, plan as above.
   - To IR for HD tunneled catheter placement today
   - Hemodialysis following tunneled catheter placement
   - Renally dose all meds, follow vanc level. Vanco trough to be drawn
   tomorrow AM
   - Continue outpatient meds including phoslo, epo (will clarify dose).
   Will hold on iron supplementation as NPO for now.
   # Thrombocytopenia: 42 this morning, up from 39.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 7385**].
   Admit platelet count to OSH was within normal limits, HIT ab negative.
   Likely medication induced versus critical illness effect. DDAVP given
   with minimal effect, but not dropping
   - Will need to transfuse platelets if required for line placement
   - Send smear
   - If continues to fall, will call heme consult
   # Neck fullness: CT shows no hemorrhage or focal fluid collection. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be edema from prior thyroid surgery or normal body habitus, as CT read
   shows soft fat with mild stranding.
   # PTT coagulopathy: Resolving. Current PTT of 33.8 is reduced from 41.4
   ( >100 on admission).  Got FFP at OSH several days ago.
   - APLA, lupus anticoagulant pending
   - mixing studies to rule out acquired factor deficiency pending
   - Continue to trend
   # Anemia: Hct stable this morning at 25.  Had drop in hematocrit from
   28--
21, unclear cause. No obvious source of bleed. ?GI bleed due to
   Guiac positive stool, though no frank blood in ileostomy bag or on
   other sources of bleeding. Chronic, macrocytic, due to ESRD and B12
   deficiency. Baseline around 25.  No GI c/s for now as hct stable.
   - Received 1 unit PRBC [**2-12**] with appropriate bump
   - Serial hematocrits q6 hours with goal > 25
   - Continue procrit q Sunday
   - Maintain active T&S
   - B12 injections Q month
   - Holding iron supplementation as above
   # Bradycardia:  None since admission.  History of CAD, no MI, last ECHO
   [**2138-3-7**].  Has low voltage on ECG from OSH  as well, and given
   low albumin, concerning for pericardial effusion. Echo on [**2138-2-11**] shows
   LVEF of 55%.
   - Continue to follow
   # Chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency: Appreciate wound care
   recommendations. Will keep legs elevated, turn and reposition every [**2-6**]
   hours, keep heels off bed, and keep legs moisturized and clean.
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given
   sepsis/hypotension. Not currently on pressors.  BP
s have been
   110-120
s systolic.
   # UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy: Ostomy care
   # FEN: Appreciate nutrition consult.  Will give tube feedings
   (Novasource Renal diet with 15g beneprotein at 10mL/hr, increased by
   10mL/hr to 30mL/hr x24 hours).
   -Will check residuals- feedings to be held if residuals > 150 mL.
   - If transitioned to TPN, will start regular TPN protocol and check
   triglycerides.Can consider TPN given IBD and watery diarrhea. IVF as
   above to maintain MAP and UOP. Replete lytes prn.
   # Access: Triple lumen PICC. Not currently centrally located.
   # PPx: Holding DVT ppx given lower extremity skin breakdown and low
   platelets, PPI, VAP ppx, HOB > 30 degrees

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently in the ICU and have been diagnosed with possible sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, anemia, isolated elevated PTT, severe malnutrition, acute on chronic renal failure, and severe hypokalemia. The patient's condition is grave, and they have chosen a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient may be at risk of further deterioration due to a possible infection leading to sepsis. This can be indicated by the presence of fever, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, and low blood pressure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory system is compromised, leading to difficulty in breathing. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs, potentially causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is limited, which could be attributed to various factors such as sepsis, renal dysfunction, or medication effects. This may lead to confusion, disorientation, and impaired decision-making abilities.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. This can manifest as spontaneous bleeding, bruising, or prolonged bleeding from wounds or procedures.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreased, indicating anemia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis with an altered mental status and renal dysfunction. Sepsis can progress to septic shock if not managed properly.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to hypoxemia and obtundation. This could be caused by pneumonia or other lung infections. If left untreated, it can lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ failure.

3. Pulmonary edema and pleural effusions: The presence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs. If not addressed, it can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of complications.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to various factors such as sepsis, uremia, or medication effects. Proper assessment and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate care.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has progressive thrombocytopenia, which may be related to medication use or an underlying condition. This can increase the risk of bleeding, especially if the platelet count continues to drop.

6. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped, indicating anemia. This could be a component of renal dysfunction-related platelet dysfunction. Monitoring and"

   -pt w/ spont rate; could trial PSV today. No plans to extubate given
   obtundation
   -cont  ABX as above
   -consider diuresis if Hct stable, remains hemodynamically stable
   -pulm toilet, HOB up, mouth care
   ALTERED MS- Most likely multifactorial. Low index of suspicion for
   bacterial meningitis. OSH MRI not consistent with Herpes. Poss

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 75 year old female with history of recurrent drug-resistant
   UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis who is
   admitted from an OSH with altered mental status, hypothermia and
   presumed sepsis.
   # UTI/ Presumed sepsis: Likely sources are sputum growing GPCs, urine
   culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000 colonies), all at
   OSH.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase in cortisol level. DIC
   panel negative
   - PICC line, triple lumen in place from OSH- needs to be replaced or
   moved centrally via fluoroscopy
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12 off PICC, check ScVO2
   - Transfuse for Hct > 25, checking q6 hematocrits
   - Broad spectrum abx including vanc, zosyn, flagyl
 for coverage of
   known pseudomasl UTI (zosyn) and vanc for GPC
s, flagyl for empiric C.
   diff coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Patient is followed as outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7384**] (ID)
 will contact
   # AMS: Appears to be improving, eyes intermittently open though she
   does not open eyes to command, but withdraws from pain. Had Neuro
   consult at OSH, ruled out myxedema given thyroid disease, MRI
   unremarkable.  CT head negative for bleed.  Renal consult believes
   uremia could be the cause- patient is to be dialyzed today after line
   placement with IR, so will assess response. Most likely
   multifactorial.  Low index of suspician for CNS infection given
   presentation and imaging, no LP for now.  Other causes could include
   sub-clinical seizure.
   - Continue to follow mental status
   - Will obtain EEG to rule out seizure activity
   - Hemodialysis today after catheter placement by IR.
   - Avoid sedating meds if possible
   - Consider Haldol prn agitation, propofol if sedation needed
   #Hypernatremia: 146 this morning. Likely secondary to large amounts of
   saline given IV
   - Increase free water boluses to 250 mL q8 hours
   - trend
   # Stage V CKD: Followed by transplant surgery as outpatient.  Had plan
   for AVF placement on [**1-7**] but postponed due to recurrent
   UTI/urosepsis.  Has not needed urgent HD to date.   Per renal c/s,
   possible cause of AMS is uremia, plan as above.
   - To IR for HD tunneled catheter placement today
   - Hemodialysis following tunneled catheter placement
   - Renally dose all meds, follow vanc level. Vanco trough to be drawn
   tomorrow AM
   - Continue outpatient meds including phoslo, epo (will clarify dose).
   Will hold on iron supplementation as NPO for now.
   # Thrombocytopenia: 42 this morning, up from 39.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 7385**].
   Admit platelet count to OSH was within normal limits, HIT ab negative.
   Likely medication induced versus critical illness effect. DDAVP given
   with minimal effect, but not dropping
   - Will need to transfuse platelets if required for line placement
   - Send smear
   - If continues to fall, will call heme consult
   # Neck fullness: CT shows no hemorrhage or focal fluid collection. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be edema from prior thyroid surgery or normal body habitus, as CT read
   shows soft fat with mild stranding.
   # PTT coagulopathy: Resolving. Current PTT of 33.8 is reduced from 41.4
   ( >100 on admission).  Got FFP at OSH several days ago.
   - APLA, lupus anticoagulant pending
   - mixing studies to rule out acquired factor deficiency pending
   - Continue to trend
   # Anemia: Hct stable this morning at 25.  Had drop in hematocrit from
   28--
21, unclear cause. No obvious source of bleed. ?GI bleed due to
   Guiac positive stool, though no frank blood in ileostomy bag or on
   other sources of bleeding. Chronic, macrocytic, due to ESRD and B12
   deficiency. Baseline around 25.  No GI c/s for now as hct stable.
   - Received 1 unit PRBC [**2-12**] with appropriate bump
   - Serial hematocrits q6 hours with goal > 25
   - Continue procrit q Sunday
   - Maintain active T&S
   - B12 injections Q month
   - Holding iron supplementation as above
   # Bradycardia:  None since admission.  History of CAD, no MI, last ECHO
   [**2138-3-7**].  Has low voltage on ECG from OSH  as well, and given
   low albumin, concerning for pericardial effusion. Echo on [**2138-2-11**] shows
   LVEF of 55%.
   - Continue to follow
   # Chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency: Appreciate wound care
   recommendations. Will keep legs elevated, turn and reposition every [**2-6**]
   hours, keep heels off bed, and keep legs moisturized and clean.
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given
   sepsis/hypotension. Not currently on pressors.  BP
s have been
   110-120
s systolic.
   # UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy: Ostomy care
   # FEN: Appreciate nutrition consult.  Will give tube feedings
   (Novasource Renal diet with 15g beneprotein at 10mL/hr, increased by
   10mL/hr to 30mL/hr x24 hours).
   -Will check residuals- feedings to be held if residuals > 150 mL.
   - If transitioned to TPN, will start regular TPN protocol and check
   triglycerides.Can consider TPN given IBD and watery diarrhea. IVF as
   above to maintain MAP and UOP. Replete lytes prn.
   # Access: Triple lumen PICC. Not currently centrally located.
   # PPx: Holding DVT ppx given lower extremity skin breakdown and low
   platelets, PPI, VAP ppx, HOB > 30 degrees

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of recurrent drug-resistant urinary tract infections (UTIs), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypothermia, and presumed sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has multiple medical complications including UTI, AMS (altered mental status), hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, PTT coagulopathy, anemia, bradycardia, chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency, hypertension, UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy, FEN (feeding tube), and access issues with a triple lumen PICC line. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UTI: The patient has a history of recurrent drug-resistant UTIs, and there is evidence of infection with GPCs in the sputum and Pseudomonas in the urine.
2. AMS: The patient presents with altered mental status, which could be due to multiple factors such as sepsis, uremia, or subclinical seizure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, likely secondary to large amounts of saline given IV. This needs to be corrected with free water boluses.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 75 year old female with history of recurrent drug-resistant
   UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis who is
   admitted from an OSH with altered mental status, hypothermia and
   presumed sepsis.
   # UTI/ Presumed sepsis: Likely sources are sputum growing GPCs, urine
   culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000 colonies), all at
   OSH.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase in cortisol level. DIC
   panel negative
   - PICC line, triple lumen in place from OSH- needs to be replaced or
   moved centrally via fluoroscopy
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12 off PICC, check ScVO2
   - Transfuse for Hct > 25, checking q6 hematocrits
   - Broad spectrum abx including vanc, zosyn, flagyl
 for coverage of
   known pseudomasl UTI (zosyn) and vanc for GPC
s, flagyl for empiric C.
   diff coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Patient is followed as outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7384**] (ID)
 will contact
   # AMS: Appears to be improving, eyes intermittently open though she
   does not open eyes to command, but withdraws from pain. Had Neuro
   consult at OSH, ruled out myxedema given thyroid disease, MRI
   unremarkable.  CT head negative for bleed.  Renal consult believes
   uremia could be the cause- patient is to be dialyzed today after line
   placement with IR, so will assess response. Most likely
   multifactorial.  Low index of suspician for CNS infection given
   presentation and imaging, no LP for now.  Other causes could include
   sub-clinical seizure.
   - Continue to follow mental status
   - Will obtain EEG to rule out seizure activity
   - Hemodialysis today after catheter placement by IR.
   - Avoid sedating meds if possible
   - Consider Haldol prn agitation, propofol if sedation needed
   #Hypernatremia: 146 this morning. Likely secondary to large amounts of
   saline given IV
   - Increase free water boluses to 250 mL q8 hours
   - trend
   # Stage V CKD: Followed by transplant surgery as outpatient.  Had plan
   for AVF placement on [**1-7**] but postponed due to recurrent
   UTI/urosepsis.  Has not needed urgent HD to date.   Per renal c/s,
   possible cause of AMS is uremia, plan as above.
   - To IR for HD tunneled catheter placement today
   - Hemodialysis following tunneled catheter placement
   - Renally dose all meds, follow vanc level. Vanco trough to be drawn
   tomorrow AM
   - Continue outpatient meds including phoslo, epo (will clarify dose).
   Will hold on iron supplementation as NPO for now.
   # Thrombocytopenia: 42 this morning, up from 39.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 7385**].
   Admit platelet count to OSH was within normal limits, HIT ab negative.
   Likely medication induced versus critical illness effect. DDAVP given
   with minimal effect, but not dropping
   - Will need to transfuse platelets if required for line placement
   - Send smear
   - If continues to fall, will call heme consult
   # Neck fullness: CT shows no hemorrhage or focal fluid collection. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be edema from prior thyroid surgery or normal body habitus, as CT read
   shows soft fat with mild stranding.
   # PTT coagulopathy: Resolving. Current PTT of 33.8 is reduced from 41.4
   ( >100 on admission).  Got FFP at OSH several days ago.
   - APLA, lupus anticoagulant pending
   - mixing studies to rule out acquired factor deficiency pending
   - Continue to trend
   # Anemia: Hct stable this morning at 25.  Had drop in hematocrit from
   28--
21, unclear cause. No obvious source of bleed. ?GI bleed due to
   Guiac positive stool, though no frank blood in ileostomy bag or on
   other sources of bleeding. Chronic, macrocytic, due to ESRD and B12
   deficiency. Baseline around 25.  No GI c/s for now as hct stable.
   - Received 1 unit PRBC [**2-12**] with appropriate bump
   - Serial hematocrits q6 hours with goal > 25
   - Continue procrit q Sunday
   - Maintain active T&S
   - B12 injections Q month
   - Holding iron supplementation as above
   # Bradycardia:  None since admission.  History of CAD, no MI, last ECHO
   [**2138-3-7**].  Has low voltage on ECG from OSH  as well, and given
   low albumin, concerning for pericardial effusion. Echo on [**2138-2-11**] shows
   LVEF of 55%.
   - Continue to follow
   # Chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency: Appreciate wound care
   recommendations. Will keep legs elevated, turn and reposition every [**2-6**]
   hours, keep heels off bed, and keep legs moisturized and clean.
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given
   sepsis/hypotension. Not currently on pressors.  BP
s have been
   110-120
s systolic.
   # UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy: Ostomy care
   # FEN: Appreciate nutrition consult.  Will give tube feedings
   (Novasource Renal diet with 15g beneprotein at 10mL/hr, increased by
   10mL/hr to 30mL/hr x24 hours).
   -Will check residuals- feedings to be held if residuals > 150 mL.
   - If transitioned to TPN, will start regular TPN protocol and check
   triglycerides.Can consider TPN given IBD and watery diarrhea. IVF as
   above to maintain MAP and UOP. Replete lytes prn.
   # Access: Triple lumen PICC. Not currently centrally located.
   # PPx: Holding DVT ppx given lower extremity skin breakdown and low
   platelets, PPI, VAP ppx, HOB > 30 degrees
   .

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have a history of acute on chronic renal failure, possible sepsis, respiratory failure with evidence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe malnutrition, and isolated elevated PTT. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are dependent on mechanical ventilation and have diminished breath sounds bilaterally. They have a tracheostomy tube in place and are receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. They also have positive cultures for pseudomonas in their urine and yeast in their urine. The patient's renal function is impaired, and they are oliguric. The patient's mental status is limited, and they are not purposefully moving. They have a history of poor nutrition, and their platelet count is low. The patient's condition is grave, and they have discussed their goals of care with the family, opting for a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of possible sepsis, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive cultures for pseudomonas and yeast in the urine. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening if not managed promptly and"

   Assessment: 75 year old female with history of recurrent drug-resistant
   UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis who is
   admitted from an OSH with altered mental status, hypothermia and
   presumed sepsis.
   # UTI/ Presumed sepsis: Likely sources are sputum growing GPCs, urine
   culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000 colonies), all at
   OSH.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase in cortisol level. DIC
   panel negative
   - PICC line, triple lumen in place from OSH- needs to be replaced or
   moved centrally via fluoroscopy
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12 off PICC, check ScVO2
   - Transfuse for Hct > 25, checking q6 hematocrits
   - Broad spectrum abx including vanc, zosyn, flagyl
 for coverage of
   known pseudomasl UTI (zosyn) and vanc for GPC
s, flagyl for empiric C.
   diff coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Patient is followed as outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7384**] (ID)
 will contact
   # AMS: Appears to be improving, eyes intermittently open though she
   does not open eyes to command, but withdraws from pain. Had Neuro
   consult at OSH, ruled out myxedema given thyroid disease, MRI
   unremarkable.  CT head negative for bleed.  Renal consult believes
   uremia could be the cause- patient is to be dialyzed today after line
   placement with IR, so will assess response. Most likely
   multifactorial.  Low index of suspician for CNS infection given
   presentation and imaging, no LP for now.  Other causes could include
   sub-clinical seizure.
   - Continue to follow mental status
   - Will obtain EEG to rule out seizure activity
   - Hemodialysis today after catheter placement by IR.
   - Avoid sedating meds if possible
   - Consider Haldol prn agitation, propofol if sedation needed
   #Hypernatremia: 146 this morning. Likely secondary to large amounts of
   saline given IV
   - Increase free water boluses to 250 mL q8 hours
   - trend
   # Stage V CKD: Followed by transplant surgery as outpatient.  Had plan
   for AVF placement on [**1-7**] but postponed due to recurrent
   UTI/urosepsis.  Has not needed urgent HD to date.   Per renal c/s,
   possible cause of AMS is uremia, plan as above.
   - To IR for HD tunneled catheter placement today
   - Hemodialysis following tunneled catheter placement
   - Renally dose all meds, follow vanc level. Vanco trough to be drawn
   tomorrow AM
   - Continue outpatient meds including phoslo, epo (will clarify dose).
   Will hold on iron supplementation as NPO for now.
   # Thrombocytopenia: 42 this morning, up from 39.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 7385**].
   Admit platelet count to OSH was within normal limits, HIT ab negative.
   Likely medication induced versus critical illness effect. DDAVP given
   with minimal effect, but not dropping
   - Will need to transfuse platelets if required for line placement
   - Send smear
   - If continues to fall, will call heme consult
   # Neck fullness: CT shows no hemorrhage or focal fluid collection. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be edema from prior thyroid surgery or normal body habitus, as CT read
   shows soft fat with mild stranding.
   # PTT coagulopathy: Resolving. Current PTT of 33.8 is reduced from 41.4
   ( >100 on admission).  Got FFP at OSH several days ago.
   - APLA, lupus anticoagulant pending
   - mixing studies to rule out acquired factor deficiency pending
   - Continue to trend
   # Anemia: Hct stable this morning at 25.  Had drop in hematocrit from
   28--
21, unclear cause. No obvious source of bleed. ?GI bleed due to
   Guiac positive stool, though no frank blood in ileostomy bag or on
   other sources of bleeding. Chronic, macrocytic, due to ESRD and B12
   deficiency. Baseline around 25.  No GI c/s for now as hct stable.
   - Received 1 unit PRBC [**2-12**] with appropriate bump
   - Serial hematocrits q6 hours with goal > 25
   - Continue procrit q Sunday
   - Maintain active T&S
   - B12 injections Q month
   - Holding iron supplementation as above
   # Bradycardia:  None since admission.  History of CAD, no MI, last ECHO
   [**2138-3-7**].  Has low voltage on ECG from OSH  as well, and given
   low albumin, concerning for pericardial effusion. Echo on [**2138-2-11**] shows
   LVEF of 55%.
   - Continue to follow
   # Chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency: Appreciate wound care
   recommendations. Will keep legs elevated, turn and reposition every [**2-6**]
   hours, keep heels off bed, and keep legs moisturized and clean.
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given
   sepsis/hypotension. Not currently on pressors.  BP
s have been
   110-120
s systolic.
   # UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy: Ostomy care
   # FEN: Appreciate nutrition consult.  Will give tube feedings
   (Novasource Renal diet with 15g beneprotein at 10mL/hr, increased by
   10mL/hr to 30mL/hr x24 hours).
   -Will check residuals- feedings to be held if residuals > 150 mL.
   - If transitioned to TPN, will start regular TPN protocol and check
   triglycerides.Can consider TPN given IBD and watery diarrhea. IVF as
   above to maintain MAP and UOP. Replete lytes prn.
   # Access: Triple lumen PICC. Not currently centrally located.
   # PPx: Holding DVT ppx given lower extremity skin breakdown and low
   platelets, PPI, VAP ppx, HOB > 30 degrees

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypothermia, and presumed sepsis. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently on various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may worsen due to sepsis and inadequate renal function.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent drug-resistant UTIs, and there is a concern for a current UTI contributing to her sepsis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There is also evidence of pneumonia with sputum growing Gram-positive cocci.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to medication-induced causes, critical illness, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely secondary to large amounts of saline given intravenously.
6. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, possibly due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and vitamin B12 deficiency.
7. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia, which may be related to her"

   Assessment: 75 year old female with history of recurrent drug-resistant
   UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis who is
   admitted from an OSH with altered mental status, hypothermia and
   presumed sepsis.
   # UTI/ Presumed sepsis: Likely sources are sputum growing GPCs, urine
   culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000 colonies), all at
   OSH.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase in cortisol level. DIC
   panel negative
   - PICC line, triple lumen in place from OSH- needs to be replaced or
   moved centrally via fluoroscopy
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12 off PICC, check ScVO2
   - Transfuse for Hct > 25, checking q6 hematocrits
   - Broad spectrum abx including vanc, zosyn, flagyl
 for coverage of
   known pseudomasl UTI (zosyn) and vanc for GPC
s, flagyl for empiric C.
   diff coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Patient is followed as outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7384**] (ID)
 will contact
   # AMS: Appears to be improving, eyes intermittently open though she
   does not open eyes to command, but withdraws from pain. Had Neuro
   consult at OSH, ruled out myxedema given thyroid disease, MRI
   unremarkable.  CT head negative for bleed.  Renal consult believes
   uremia could be the cause- patient is to be dialyzed today after line
   placement with IR, so will assess response. Most likely
   multifactorial.  Low index of suspician for CNS infection given
   presentation and imaging, no LP for now.  Other causes could include
   sub-clinical seizure.
   - Continue to follow mental status
   - Will obtain EEG to rule out seizure activity
   - Hemodialysis today after catheter placement by IR.
   - Avoid sedating meds if possible
   - Consider Haldol prn agitation, propofol if sedation needed
   #Hypernatremia: 146 this morning. Likely secondary to large amounts of
   saline given IV
   - Increase free water boluses to 250 mL q8 hours
   - trend
   # Stage V CKD: Followed by transplant surgery as outpatient.  Had plan
   for AVF placement on [**1-7**] but postponed due to recurrent
   UTI/urosepsis.  Has not needed urgent HD to date.   Per renal c/s,
   possible cause of AMS is uremia, plan as above.
   - To IR for HD tunneled catheter placement today
   - Hemodialysis following tunneled catheter placement
   - Renally dose all meds, follow vanc level. Vanco trough to be drawn
   tomorrow AM
   - Continue outpatient meds including phoslo, epo (will clarify dose).
   Will hold on iron supplementation as NPO for now.
   # Thrombocytopenia: 42 this morning, up from 39.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 7385**].
   Admit platelet count to OSH was within normal limits, HIT ab negative.
   Likely medication induced versus critical illness effect. DDAVP given
   with minimal effect, but not dropping
   - Will need to transfuse platelets if required for line placement
   - Send smear
   - If continues to fall, will call heme consult
   # Neck fullness: CT shows no hemorrhage or focal fluid collection. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be edema from prior thyroid surgery or normal body habitus, as CT read
   shows soft fat with mild stranding.
   # PTT coagulopathy: Resolving. Current PTT of 33.8 is reduced from 41.4
   ( >100 on admission).  Got FFP at OSH several days ago.
   - APLA, lupus anticoagulant pending
   - mixing studies to rule out acquired factor deficiency pending
   - Continue to trend
   # Anemia: Hct stable this morning at 25.  Had drop in hematocrit from
   28--
21, unclear cause. No obvious source of bleed. ?GI bleed due to
   Guiac positive stool, though no frank blood in ileostomy bag or on
   other sources of bleeding. Chronic, macrocytic, due to ESRD and B12
   deficiency. Baseline around 25.  No GI c/s for now as hct stable.
   - Received 1 unit PRBC [**2-12**] with appropriate bump
   - Serial hematocrits q6 hours with goal > 25
   - Continue procrit q Sunday
   - Maintain active T&S
   - B12 injections Q month
   - Holding iron supplementation as above
   # Bradycardia:  None since admission.  History of CAD, no MI, last ECHO
   [**2138-3-7**].  Has low voltage on ECG from OSH  as well, and given
   low albumin, concerning for pericardial effusion. Echo on [**2138-2-11**] shows
   LVEF of 55%.
   - Continue to follow
   # Chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency: Appreciate wound care
   recommendations. Will keep legs elevated, turn and reposition every [**2-6**]
   hours, keep heels off bed, and keep legs moisturized and clean.
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given
   sepsis/hypotension. Not currently on pressors.  BP
s have been
   110-120
s systolic.
   # UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy: Ostomy care
   # FEN: Appreciate nutrition consult.  Will give tube feedings
   (Novasource Renal diet with 15g beneprotein at 10mL/hr, increased by
   10mL/hr to 30mL/hr x24 hours).
   -Will check residuals- feedings to be held if residuals > 150 mL.
   - If transitioned to TPN, will start regular TPN protocol and check
   triglycerides.Can consider TPN given IBD and watery diarrhea. IVF as
   above to maintain MAP and UOP. Replete lytes prn.
   # Access: Triple lumen PICC. Not currently centrally located.
   # PPx: Holding DVT ppx given lower extremity skin breakdown and low
   platelets, PPI, VAP ppx, HOB > 30 degrees

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypothermia, and presumed sepsis. The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is currently experiencing acute renal failure. This can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and the need for dialysis.

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent drug-resistant UTIs, and there is suspicion of a current UTI. If left untreated, it can progress to urosepsis and potentially lead to septic shock.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding, especially during procedures such as line placements.

4. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk of malnutrition due to her chronic illness and inability to eat normally. This can lead to further complications and impair wound healing.

5. Sepsis: The patient is already presumed to have sepsis, and if not appropriately managed, it can progress to septic shock and organ failure.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis, which can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further skin breakdown and potential infections.

   Assessment: 75 year old female with history of recurrent drug-resistant
   UTIs, ESRD, CAD, HTN and chronic stasis dermatitis/cellulitis who is
   admitted from an OSH with altered mental status, hypothermia and
   presumed sepsis.
   # UTI/ Presumed sepsis: Likely sources are sputum growing GPCs, urine
   culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000 colonies), all at
   OSH.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase in cortisol level. DIC
   panel negative
   - PICC line, triple lumen in place from OSH- needs to be replaced or
   moved centrally via fluoroscopy
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12 off PICC, check ScVO2
   - Transfuse for Hct > 25, checking q6 hematocrits
   - Broad spectrum abx including vanc, zosyn, flagyl
 for coverage of
   known pseudomasl UTI (zosyn) and vanc for GPC
s, flagyl for empiric C.
   diff coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Patient is followed as outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7384**] (ID)
 will contact
   # AMS: Appears to be improving, eyes intermittently open though she
   does not open eyes to command, but withdraws from pain. Had Neuro
   consult at OSH, ruled out myxedema given thyroid disease, MRI
   unremarkable.  CT head negative for bleed.  Renal consult believes
   uremia could be the cause- patient is to be dialyzed today after line
   placement with IR, so will assess response. Most likely
   multifactorial.  Low index of suspician for CNS infection given
   presentation and imaging, no LP for now.  Other causes could include
   sub-clinical seizure.
   - Continue to follow mental status
   - Will obtain EEG to rule out seizure activity
   - Hemodialysis today after catheter placement by IR.
   - Avoid sedating meds if possible
   - Consider Haldol prn agitation, propofol if sedation needed
   #Hypernatremia: 146 this morning. Likely secondary to large amounts of
   saline given IV
   - Increase free water boluses to 250 mL q8 hours
   - trend
   # Stage V CKD: Followed by transplant surgery as outpatient.  Had plan
   for AVF placement on [**1-7**] but postponed due to recurrent
   UTI/urosepsis.  Has not needed urgent HD to date.   Per renal c/s,
   possible cause of AMS is uremia, plan as above.
   - To IR for HD tunneled catheter placement today
   - Hemodialysis following tunneled catheter placement
   - Renally dose all meds, follow vanc level. Vanco trough to be drawn
   tomorrow AM
   - Continue outpatient meds including phoslo, epo (will clarify dose).
   Will hold on iron supplementation as NPO for now.
   # Thrombocytopenia: 42 this morning, up from 39.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 7385**].
   Admit platelet count to OSH was within normal limits, HIT ab negative.
   Likely medication induced versus critical illness effect. DDAVP given
   with minimal effect, but not dropping
   - Will need to transfuse platelets if required for line placement
   - Send smear
   - If continues to fall, will call heme consult
   # Neck fullness: CT shows no hemorrhage or focal fluid collection. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be edema from prior thyroid surgery or normal body habitus, as CT read
   shows soft fat with mild stranding.
   # PTT coagulopathy: Resolving. Current PTT of 33.8 is reduced from 41.4
   ( >100 on admission).  Got FFP at OSH several days ago.
   - APLA, lupus anticoagulant pending
   - mixing studies to rule out acquired factor deficiency pending
   - Continue to trend
   # Anemia: Hct stable this morning at 25.  Had drop in hematocrit from
   28--
21, unclear cause. No obvious source of bleed. ?GI bleed due to
   Guiac positive stool, though no frank blood in ileostomy bag or on
   other sources of bleeding. Chronic, macrocytic, due to ESRD and B12
   deficiency. Baseline around 25.  No GI c/s for now as hct stable.
   - Received 1 unit PRBC [**2-12**] with appropriate bump
   - Serial hematocrits q6 hours with goal > 25
   - Continue procrit q Sunday
   - Maintain active T&S
   - B12 injections Q month
   - Holding iron supplementation as above
   # Bradycardia:  None since admission.  History of CAD, no MI, last ECHO
   [**2138-3-7**].  Has low voltage on ECG from OSH  as well, and given
   low albumin, concerning for pericardial effusion. Echo on [**2138-2-11**] shows
   LVEF of 55%.
   - Continue to follow
   # Chronic cellulitis/venous insufficiency: Appreciate wound care
   recommendations. Will keep legs elevated, turn and reposition every [**2-6**]
   hours, keep heels off bed, and keep legs moisturized and clean.
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given
   sepsis/hypotension. Not currently on pressors.  BP
s have been
   110-120
s systolic.
   # UC s/p colectomy with ileostomy: Ostomy care
   # FEN: Appreciate nutrition consult.  Will give tube feedings
   (Novasource Renal diet with 15g beneprotein at 10mL/hr, increased by
   10mL/hr to 30mL/hr x24 hours).
   -Will check residuals- feedings to be held if residuals > 150 mL.
   - If transitioned to TPN, will start regular TPN protocol and check
   triglycerides.Can consider TPN given IBD and watery diarrhea. IVF as
   above to maintain MAP and UOP. Replete lytes prn.
   # Access: Triple lumen PICC. Not currently centrally located.
   # PPx: Holding DVT ppx given lower extremity skin breakdown and low
   platelets, PPI, VAP ppx, HOB > 30 degrees

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Patient remains unresponsive, but on small amount of versed. I would
   stop the Versed and use propofol if needed for agitation so we can
   assess mental status off of sedation several times a day. Head CT was
   negative. Would obtain a neuro consult and EEG to assess for possible
   non motor seizures.
   Patien with excellent oxygenation on 35% FIO2. I have switched her from
   AC to PSV. If patient tolerates this well, not clear she needs
   mechanical ventilation. PEEP reduced from 10 to 5. If patient tolerates
   PSV, will need to determine if she can come off the vent. If she is
   felt to need airway protection, I would argue for a trach to enable her
   to be off the ventilator rather than keep the ETT in place (reduce risk
   of vent associated pneumonia). Patient getting dialysis to remove fluid
   and to see if elevated BUN is contributing to altered mental status.
   Given the level of BUN, I doubt uremia is playing a major role. Removal
   of fluid may help reduce the effusions. If not much progress made
   there, may need thoracentesis on left where there is significant
   compression atelectasis.
   Patient had dialysis yesterday and due for another episode today.
   Electrolytes acceptable. Mild metabolic acidosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, urinary tract infection, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, malnutrition, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. The patient is currently unresponsive but being sedated for agitation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 98/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) line in place and is receiving dialysis to remove fluid and treat elevated BUN levels. The patient's electrolytes are within acceptable ranges, but there is a mild metabolic acidosis. The patient is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure and current mechanical ventilation put them at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and atelectasis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including chronic urinary tract infection (UTI), possible urosepsis, altered mental status, and chronic kidney failure. 

The patient's neurologic status has improved slightly. The altered mental status is likely due to sepsis, poor oral intake, or accumulation of toxic metabolites. Thyroid studies are within normal limits per OSH.

The patient's urosepsis/pneumonia is being treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, pending culture and sensitivity data. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending, and the fecal culture is negative for campylobacter. Stool C. Diff toxin is also negative.

The patient's bradycardia has resolved, likely secondary to hypothermia. It will continue to be monitored via telemetry.

The patient has stage V chronic kidney disease, which is stable post first hemodialysis. The next dialysis is scheduled for Monday [**2-16**]. The patient's potassium will increase due to renal failure, so potassium phosphate 30mmol x1 dose will be given per renal recommendations.

   - K will increase due to renal failure. Will monitor and replete K as
   needed
   - Renal dosage of medications
   - Continue home regimen of phosphate binders
   - Vancomycin trough is slightly elevated at 23.4. Obtain vancomycin
   troughs q 48 hours prior to dialysis
   #Thrombocytopenia
   -TTP workup per Neuro consult: - Haptoglobin normal at 72. Ammonia 16
   -Likely secondary to renal failure.
   -Anti-PF4 negative on [**2-5**] so HIT unlikely
   -Continue Procrit injections. Next injection today [**2-15**]
   -Mixing study to determine inhibitor vs. factor deficiency
   -Antiphospholipid antibody study

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including chronic UTI/possible urosepsis, chronic kidney failure, and altered mental status. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated. The patient's neurologic status has slightly improved. She has a history of chronic UTI, which may be leading to urosepsis. She also has stage V chronic kidney disease and is on dialysis. Other conditions include thrombocytopenia, anemia, and LE cellulitis. The patient's altered mental status could be due to sepsis, poor oral intake, or accumulation of toxic metabolites. Thyroid studies are normal. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Urosepsis/PNA: The patient may develop further complications related to her chronic UTI, such as worsening sepsis or pneumonia.
2. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's kidney function is compromised, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to chronic renal failure and previous GI bleed.
5. LE cellulitis: The patient has chronic leg ulcers, which can become infected and complicate wound care.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed.
7. FEN (unknown abbreviation): The patient requires nutritional support through tube feeds.
8. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate may decrease, especially given her history of CAD.
9. TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura): Although initial workup was negative, the patient may still develop complications related to TTP.
10. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia): Although unlikely, the patient's negative anti-PF4 test reduces the risk of HIT.
11. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: This condition can cause blood clots and pregnancy-related complications, but it is not directly indicated in the patient's progress note.
12. GI bleed: The patient's history of GI bleed increases the risk of further bleeding.
13. Infection: Given the patient's compromised immune system, she is at increased risk of developing infections.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan: 75 y/o woman with multiple medical problems
   including chronic UTI/possible urosepsis with altered mental status and
   Chronic Kidney failure s/p HD initiation, with continued decreased
   mental status.
   #Altered mental status, Likely multifactorial, possibly due to sepsis
   vs. accumulation of toxic metabolites. Thyroid studies are wnl per OSH.
   EEG shows no evidence of seizure activity, but patient is on propofol,
   so will need to re-check after sedation has been weaned. There is also
   a possibility of HSV encephalitis despite the normal EEG (again
   possibly due to sedative effects).
   - Appreciate Neuro consult: TTP workup negative (Haptoglobin 72, LDH is
   254 but this is nonspecific and could be due to tissue hypoxia).
   Ammonia levels WNL
   - Obtained EEG- No seizure activity as noted above. Will avoid
   sedatives and repeat if necessary
   - Avoid benzodiazepines and other sedatives. Will use Haldol or
   propofol PRN agitation. Should wean sedation for accurate exam per
   neurology consult
   - Will obtain LP to check for HSV and begin acyclovir if appropriate.
   Will transfuse platelets prior to procedure- see below.
   #Urosepsis/PNA: Patient has chronic UTI at baseline. Final culture data
   from OSH shows sputum growing yeast but no GPC, urine growing
   Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn and ceftazidime, Blood culture negative.
   -Will continue Zosyn, and Flagyl tx pending culture and sensitivity
   data. [**Month (only) 60**] be able to discontinue vancomycin because no GPC growth was
   found on sputum culture @ OSH. Zosyn for Pseudomonas + urine Cx @ OSH.
   Continue PO Flagyl for empiric coverage. In-house Blood, urine, and
   sputum Cx pending. Fecal culture negative for campylobacter. Stool C.
   Diff toxin negative.
   -Goal MAP > 65 and UOP >30 mL/hr. Will give Levophed/IVF boluses to
   maintain
   -Maintain triple lumen catheter, can obtain CVP
   #Acute Respiratory Failure: Day 5 of intubation. Patient was intubated
   due to increased O2 requirements at outside hospital after she was
   found obtunded. Since patient is on PSV now with regular respirations
   and oxygen saturation of 98-99% on 35% O2, (RSBI =83), weaning is
   appropriate. Patient may require tracheostomy to meet respiratory
   requirements in order to reduce the risk of VAP.
   - Discussion with family regarding the risks and benefits of
   tracheostomy. Family amenable to tracheostomy should need arise.
   #Bradycardia
   -Hx CAD. Likely secondary to hypothermia. Has resolved. Will continue
   to monitor via telemetry.
   #Stage V Chronic Kidney Disease: Unclear etiology. Stable s/p first

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including chronic UTI/possible urosepsis, altered mental status, and chronic kidney failure. She was admitted to the ICU for intubation due to increased oxygen requirements at an outside hospital after being found obtunded. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has altered mental status. She is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and 35% oxygen. The respiratory support is appropriate given her RSBI of 83, indicating readiness for weaning.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage V, which is unclear in etiology. She received her first hemodialysis session yesterday and showed stable renal function post-dialysis. She will continue with regular dialysis sessions as recommended by the renal team.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 46. This is likely secondary to renal failure. A TTP workup was performed, but it came back negative. The patient's ammonia levels are within normal limits, so there is no need for further investigation for hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has several other comorbidities, including hypertension, LE cellulitis, ulcerative colitis, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). These conditions are being managed appropriately based on their respective treatment plans.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is int"

   Assessment and Plan: 75 y/o woman with multiple medical problems
   including chronic UTI/possible urosepsis with altered mental status and
   Chronic Kidney failure. Patient
s neurologic status has improved
   slightly.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   #Altered mental status, Likely multifactorial, possibly due to sepsis
   vs. poor PO intake vs. accumulation of toxic metabolites. Thyroid
   studies are wnl per OSH. EEG shows no evidence of seizure activity, but
   patient is on propofol, so will need to re-check after sedation has
   been weaned. There is also a possibility of HSV encephalitis despite
   the normal EEG (again possibly due to sedative effects).
   - Appreciate Neuro consult: TTP workup negative (Haptoglobin 72, LDH is
   254 but this is nonspecific and could be due to tissue hypoxia.
   Ammonium levels WNL
   - Obtained EEG- results pending
   - Avoid benzodiazepines and other sedatives. Will use Haldol or
   propofol PRN agitation. Should wean sedation for accurate exam per
   neurology consult
   - Will obtain LP to check for HSV and begin acyclovir if appropriate.
   Will transfuse platelets prior to procedure- see below.
   #Urosepsis/PNA
   -Will continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl tx pending culture and
   sensitivity data. Vancomycin for GPCs on sputum culture @ OSH. Zosyn
   for Pseudomonas + urine Cx @ OSH. Continue PO Flagyl for empiric
   coverage. Blood, urine, and sputum Cx pending. Fecal culture negative
   for campylobacter. Stool C. Diff toxin negative.
   -Goal MAP > 65 and UOP >30 mL/hr. Will give Levophed/IVF boluses to
   maintain
   -Maintain triple lumen catheter, can obtain CVP
   #Bradycardia
   -Hx CAD. Likely secondary to hypothermia. Has resolved. Will continue
   to monitor via telemetry.
   #Stage V Chronic Kidney Disease: Unclear etiology. Stable currently
   post first hemodialysis.
   - Patient received dialysis yesterday: Lytes post-dialysis: Na- 140, K-
   3.2, Cl- 104, HCO3- 24, BUN-15, Cr- 1.2
   - Next dialysis Monday [**2-16**]
   - K will increase due to renal failure. Will give potassium phosphate
   30 mmol x1 dose per Renal recommendations.
   - Renal dosage of medications
   - Continue home regimen of phosphate binders
   - Vancomycin trough is slightly elevated at 23.4. Obtain vancomycin
   troughs q 48 hours prior to dialysis.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets stable at 46 this morning, Likely
   secondary to renal failure.
   -TTP workup per Neuro consult: - Haptoglobin normal at 72. Ammonia 16
   - Will transfuse 1 unit platelets prior to LP
   -Anti-PF4 negative on [**2-5**] so HIT unlikely
   -Continue Procrit injections. Next injection today [**2-15**]
   -Mixing study to determine inhibitor vs. factor deficiency pending
   -Antiphospholipid antibody study pending
   #Anemia: Likely secondary to previous GI bleed and chronic renal
   failure. Serial hematocrits have been stable around 25.
   - Continue to monitor hematocrit q day
   - Epoietin today
   - B12 injections q month
   - Holding iron supplementation
   #LE cellulitis
   -Chronic condition- Appreciate wound care consult and will continue
   wound care protocol including elevation of legs, heels off bed and skin
   care.
   #HTN
   -Hold antihypertensives for now.
   - Pressors if necessary.
   #Ulcerative colitis: Chronic condition. Stable for now.
   -Ostomy care.

   seeded CSF.
   Patient dialysed yesterday. Due for repeat dialysis tomorrow. Potassium
   being repleted.
   Hct and platelet count stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at
   transfusion threshold, but if LP entertained, will need platelet
   transfusion prior to LP.
   Patient on minimal ventilatory support. At this point, the ETT is place
   for suctioning and because of concern about her ability to protect her
   airway. I suspect she does not need the ventilator and we are being
   forced to keep her sedated because of it. I suggest a discussion with
   the family about either extubation and possible reintubation if she is
   unable ot handle her secretions, or go straight to a trach to allow us
   to maintain access to the lower airways.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and presents with several medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

From the review of systems and physical examination, the patient appears to have well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and is overweight/obese. The cardiovascular examination shows normal pulse rate and blood pressure. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally without crackles, wheezes, or diminished breath sounds. Extremities show 2+ edema in the right leg and 2+ edema in the left leg without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination indicates that the patient is sedated, non-purposeful movement, and unable to follow simple commands.

The laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 42 K/uL. Renal function tests indicate chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results show elevated white blood cell count, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated lactate levels.

Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions with increased interstitial markings on chest X-ray and no significant change on ultrasound.

Assessment and plan include chronic renal failure, urinary tract infection, acute respiratory failure, acute thrombocytopenia, chronic anemia, malnutrition, severe sepsis with"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   75 y/o woman with multiple medical problems including chronic
   UTI/possible urosepsis with altered mental status and Chronic Kidney
   failure s/p HD initiation, with continued decreased mental status.
   #Altered mental status, Likely multifactorial, possibly due to sepsis
   vs. accumulation of toxic metabolites. Thyroid studies are wnl per OSH.
   EEG shows no evidence of seizure activity, but patient is on propofol,
   so will need to re-check after sedation has been weaned. There is also
   a possibility of HSV encephalitis despite the normal EEG (again
   possibly due to sedative effects).
   - Appreciate Neuro consult: TTP workup negative (Haptoglobin 72, LDH is
   254 but this is nonspecific and could be due to tissue hypoxia).
   Ammonia levels WNL
   - Obtained EEG- No seizure activity as noted above. Will avoid
   sedatives and repeat if necessary
   - Avoid benzodiazepines and other sedatives. Will use Haldol or
   propofol PRN agitation. Should wean sedation for accurate exam per
   neurology consult
   - Will obtain LP to check for HSV and begin acyclovir if appropriate.
   Will transfuse platelets prior to procedure- see below.
   #Urosepsis/PNA: Patient has chronic UTI at baseline. Final culture data
   from OSH shows sputum growing yeast but no GPC, urine growing
   Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn and ceftazidime, Blood culture negative.
   -Will continue Zosyn, and Flagyl tx pending culture and sensitivity
   data. [**Month (only) 60**] be able to discontinue vancomycin because no GPC growth was
   found on sputum culture @ OSH. Zosyn for Pseudomonas + urine Cx @ OSH.
   Continue PO Flagyl for empiric coverage. In-house Blood, urine, and
   sputum Cx pending. Fecal culture negative for campylobacter. Stool C.
   Diff toxin negative.
   -Goal MAP > 65 and UOP >30 mL/hr. Will give Levophed/IVF boluses to
   maintain
   -Maintain triple lumen catheter, can obtain CVP
   #Acute Respiratory Failure: Day 5 of intubation. Patient was intubated
   due to increased O2 requirements at outside hospital after she was
   found obtunded. Since patient is on PSV now with regular respirations
   and oxygen saturation of 98-99% on 35% O2, (RSBI =83), weaning is
   appropriate. Patient may require tracheostomy to meet respiratory
   requirements in order to reduce the risk of VAP.
   - Discussion with family regarding the risks and benefits of
   tracheostomy. Family amenable to tracheostomy should need arise.
   #Bradycardia
   -Hx CAD. Likely secondary to hypothermia. Has resolved. Will continue
   to monitor via telemetry.
   #Stage V Chronic Kidney Disease: Unclear etiology. Stable s/p first
   hemodialysis.
   - Patient received dialysis yesterday: Lytes post-dialysis: Na- 140, K-
   3.2, Cl- 104, HCO3- 24, BUN-15, Cr- 1.2
   - K will increase due to renal failure. Will give potassium phosphate
   30 mmol x1 dose per Renal recommendations.
   - Renal dosage of medications
   - Continue home regimen of phosphate binders
   - Next dialysis Monday [**2-16**]
   - Vancomycin trough is slightly elevated at 23.4. Obtain vancomycin
   troughs q 48 hours prior to dialysis and adjust dose as necessary.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets stable at 46 this morning, Likely
   secondary to renal failure.
   -TTP workup per Neuro consult: Haptoglobin normal at 72. Ammonia 16
   - Will transfuse 1 unit platelets prior to LP
   -Anti-PF4 negative on [**2-5**] so HIT unlikely
   -Continue Procrit injections. Next injection today [**2-15**]
   -Mixing study to determine inhibitor vs. factor deficiency pending
   -Antiphospholipid antibody study pending
    #Anemia: Likely secondary to previous GI bleed and chronic renal
   failure. Serial hematocrits have been stable around 25.
   - Continue to monitor hematocrit q day
   - Erythropoietin today
   - B12 injections q month
   - Holding iron supplementation
    #LE cellulitis
   -Chronic condition- Appreciate wound care consult and will continue
   wound care protocol including elevation of legs, heels off bed and skin
   care.
   #HTN
   - Continue to hold antihypertensives
   - Pressors if necessary.
   #Ulcerative colitis: Chronic condition. Stable for now.
   -Ostomy care.
   #FEN
   -Appreciate Nutrition consult. Will continue tube feeds with NovaSource
   15g beneprotein at 30mL/hr
   -No fluids for now.
    #PPx
   -PPI, VAP, HOB up, Heparin 5000 U SC BID.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including chronic urinary tract infection (UTI), possible urosepsis, chronic kidney failure, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, malnutrition, sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and requires ongoing dialysis. There is a risk of further renal deterioration or complications related to dialysis.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of chronic UTI, which could lead to recurrent infections or progression to urosepsis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or complications related to prolonged intubation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to renal failure. There is a risk of bleeding or hemorrhagic complications.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, likely due to previous gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure. There is a risk of worsening anemia and associated complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient has malnutrition, which can impede wound healing, increase infection risk, and delay recovery.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient received one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to perform a lumbar puncture (LP). The LP results showed clear fluid with an opening pressure of 19 cm H2O, white blood cell count of 3 (with mostly lymphocytes), red blood cell count of 1, protein level of 28, and glucose level of 67 mg/dL. No cells were seen on gram stain, and there was no cryptococcal antigen.

2. The patient has chronic renal failure, for which renal recommends continuing empiric hemodialysis (HD). The next session of HD is scheduled today.

3. There is a suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) due to new leukocytosis without fever and an unknown source of infection. Blood culture, urine culture, and sputum culture are ordered to identify the source of infection. Antibiotics such as vancomycin (Vanco), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole (Flagyl) are being continued.

4. The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure and has a high respiratory support burden index (RSBI) of 107. The family is aware of the need for tracheostomy (trach) placement to support the patient's ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o woman with multiple medical problems including chronic
   UTI/possible urosepsis with altered mental status and Chronic Kidney
   failure s/p HD initiation, with continued decreased mental status.
   #Altered mental status, Likely multifactorial, possibly due to sepsis
   vs. accumulation of toxic metabolites. Thyroid studies are wnl per OSH.
   EEG shows no evidence of seizure activity, but patient is on propofol,
   so will need to re-check after sedation has been weaned. There is also
   a possibility of HSV encephalitis despite the normal EEG (again
   possibly due to sedative effects).
   - LP results (see above) are not concerning for infectious etiology.
   HSV PCR, VDRL pending.
   - Obtained EEG- No seizure activity as noted above. Will avoid
   sedatives and repeat if necessary
   - Avoid benzodiazepines and other sedatives. Will use propofol PRN
   agitation. Should wean sedation for accurate exam per neurology consult
   #Urosepsis/PNA: Patient has chronic UTI at baseline. Final culture data
   from OSH shows sputum growing yeast but no GPC, urine growing
   Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn and ceftazidime, Blood culture negative.
   -Will continue Zosyn,
   -Can d/c vancomycin and Flagyl because no organisms were found for
   which these agents treat. Sputum cx negative, C. Diff toxin negative.
   -Goal MAP > 65 and UOP >30 mL/hr. Will give Levophed/IVF boluses to
   maintain
   -Maintain triple lumen catheter, can obtain CVP
   #R arm cellulitis: [**Month (only) 60**] represent irritation due to cuffs, or may be new
   cellulitis. Patient has a slightly elevated WBC count this morning at
   12.3, but patient has been afebrile, no other signs or symptoms of
   infections.
   - Will continue to follow and trend.
   #Acute Respiratory Failure: Day 6 of intubation. Patient was intubated
   due to increased O2 requirements at outside hospital after she was
   found obtunded. Patient is on PSV with RSBI of 107.
   - Will not try to extubate today due to high RSBI.
   - Discussion with family regarding the risks and benefits of
   tracheostomy. Family amenable to tracheostomy should need arise.
   #Stage V Chronic Kidney Disease: Unclear etiology. Stable s/p first
   hemodialysis.
   - Patient received dialysis Saturday: Lytes post-dialysis: Na- 137, K-
   3.6, Cl- 103, HCO3- 21, BUN-21, Cr- 1.5
   - K will increase due to renal failure. Will replete potassium and
   phosphate as necessary.
   - Renal dosage of medications
   - Continue home regimen of phosphate binders
   - Next dialysis today
   - Vancomycin discontinued. No need to measure trough.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets stable at 53 this morning s/p 1 unit given
   prior to LP, Likely secondary to renal failure. Inhibitor study was
   negative, mixing study is pending.
   -TTP workup per Neuro consult: Haptoglobin normal at 72. Ammonia 16
   -Anti-PF4 negative on [**2-5**] so HIT unlikely
   -Continue Procrit injections q Sunday
   -Antiphospholipid antibody study pending
    #Anemia: Likely secondary to previous GI bleed and chronic renal
   failure. Serial hematocrits have been stable around 25.
   - Continue to monitor hematocrit q day
   - Erythropoietin today
   - B12 injections q month
   - Holding iron supplementation
   #Bradycardia
   -Hx CAD. Likely secondary to hypothermia. Has resolved. Will continue
   to monitor via telemetry.
    #LE cellulitis
   -Chronic condition- Appreciate wound care consult and will continue
   wound care protocol including elevation of legs, heels off bed and skin
   care.
   #HTN
   - Continue to hold antihypertensives
   - Pressors if necessary.
   #Ulcerative colitis: Chronic condition. Stable for now.
   -Ostomy care.
   #FEN
   -Appreciate Nutrition consult. Will continue tube feeds with NovaSource

She was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and respiratory failure. She has been intubated for six days and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 107. The patient has a history of chronic UTI and was found to have Pseudomonas in her urine, which is sensitive to Zosyn and ceftazidime. Her blood culture is negative. She also has evidence of right forearm erythema and warmth, possibly indicating cellulitis. The patient's platelet count has been stable at 53, likely secondary to renal failure. Other ongoing issues include acute respiratory failure, stage V chronic kidney disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, bradycardia, lower extremity cellulitis, hypertension, ulcerative colitis, and familial hypertriglyceridemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The family has been discussed the potential need for a tracheostomy to prevent future VAP episodes and is amenable to this intervention.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): With multiple lines and cath"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including chronic urinary tract infection (UTI), possible urosepsis, altered mental status, and chronic kidney failure. She is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 103 bpm with a baseline of 81-121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/71 mmHg to 149/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, blood glucose level of 106 mg/dL, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. The CSF analysis reveals clear and colorless fluid with 3 WBCs, 1 RBC, protein level of 28, and glucose level of 67.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including propofol, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metronidazole, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole (Protonix).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and the risk of developing pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, there is a potential for VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.

3. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.

4. Dialysis catheter-related infection: The insertion of a dialysis catheter poses a risk of infection, which can be serious and require further management.

5. Nosocomial infection: Due to the patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures, there is a risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia.

These are potential complications that may arise in this patient's case. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent and manage these complications effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o woman with multiple medical problems including chronic
   UTI/possible urosepsis with altered mental status and Chronic Kidney
   failure s/p HD initiation, with continued decreased mental status.
   #Altered mental status, Likely multifactorial, possibly due to sepsis
   vs. accumulation of toxic metabolites. Thyroid studies are wnl per OSH.
   EEG shows no evidence of seizure activity, but patient is on propofol,
   so will need to re-check after sedation has been weaned. There is also
   a possibility of HSV encephalitis despite the normal EEG (again
   possibly due to sedative effects).
   - LP results (see above) are not concerning for infectious etiology.
   HSV PCR, VDRL pending.
   - Obtained EEG- No seizure activity as noted above. Will avoid
   sedatives and repeat if necessary
   - Avoid benzodiazepines and other sedatives. Will use propofol PRN
   agitation. Should wean sedation for accurate exam per neurology consult
   #Urosepsis/PNA: Patient has chronic UTI at baseline. Final culture data
   from OSH shows sputum growing yeast but no GPC, urine growing
   Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn and ceftazidime, Blood culture negative.
   -Will continue Zosyn,
   -Can d/c vancomycin and Flagyl because no organisms were found for
   which these agents treat. Sputum cx negative, C. Diff toxin negative.
   -Goal MAP > 65 and UOP >30 mL/hr. Will give Levophed/IVF boluses to
   maintain
   -Maintain triple lumen catheter, can obtain CVP
   #R arm cellulitis: [**Month (only) 60**] represent irritation due to cuffs, or may be new
   cellulitis. Patient has a slightly elevated WBC count this morning at
   12.3, but patient has been afebrile, no other signs or symptoms of
   infections.
   - Will continue to follow and trend.
   #Acute Respiratory Failure: Day 6 of intubation. Patient was intubated
   due to increased O2 requirements at outside hospital after she was
   found obtunded. Patient is on PSV with RSBI of 107.
   - Will not try to extubate today due to high RSBI.
   - Discussion with family regarding the risks and benefits of
   tracheostomy. Family amenable to tracheostomy should need arise.
   #Stage V Chronic Kidney Disease: Unclear etiology. Stable s/p first
   hemodialysis.
   - Patient received dialysis Saturday: Lytes post-dialysis: Na- 137, K-
   3.6, Cl- 103, HCO3- 21, BUN-21, Cr- 1.5
   - K will increase due to renal failure. Will replete potassium and
   phosphate as necessary.
   - Renal dosage of medications
   - Continue home regimen of phosphate binders
   - Next dialysis today
   - Vancomycin discontinued. No need to measure trough.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets stable at 53 this morning s/p 1 unit given
   prior to LP, Likely secondary to renal failure. Inhibitor study was
   negative, mixing study is pending.
   -TTP workup per Neuro consult: Haptoglobin normal at 72. Ammonia 16
   -Anti-PF4 negative on [**2-5**] so HIT unlikely
   -Continue Procrit injections q Sunday
   -Antiphospholipid antibody study pending
    #Anemia: Likely secondary to previous GI bleed and chronic renal
   failure. Serial hematocrits have been stable around 25.
   - Continue to monitor hematocrit q day, transfuse for <21
   - Erythropoietin today
   - B12 injections q month
   - Holding iron supplementation
   #Bradycardia
   -Hx CAD. Likely secondary to hypothermia. Has resolved. Will continue
   to monitor via telemetry.
    #LE cellulitis
   -Chronic condition- Appreciate wound care consult and will continue
   wound care protocol including elevation of legs, heels off bed and skin
   care.
   #HTN
   - Continue to hold antihypertensives
   - Pressors if necessary
   #Ulcerative colitis: Chronic condition. Stable for now.
   -Ostomy care.
   #FEN
   -Appreciate Nutrition consult. Will continue tube feeds with NovaSource
   15g beneprotein at 30mL/hr
   -No fluids for now.
    #PPx
   -PPI, VAP, HOB up, Heparin 5000 U SC BID.

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including chronic UTI/possible urosepsis, altered mental status, and chronic kidney failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

The patient's recent progress includes the following:

- Negative blood culture but urine culture positive for Pseudomonas, which is sensitive to Zosyn and ceftazidime. Sputum culture shows normal flora and yeast.
- The patient received a platelet transfusion and her platelet count has improved from 46 to 53.
- Lumbar puncture results are not concerning for infectious etiology.
- The patient is on propofol for agitation, and sedation will be weaned off for a more accurate neurological examination.
- She is on Zosyn for Pseudomonas infection, and vancomycin and Flagyl can be discontinued as no organisms were found for which these agents treat.
- Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 and urine output (UOP) >30 mL/hr will be maintained.
- Triple lumen catheter will be maintained to obtain central venous pressure (CVP).
- The patient has a slightly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, but is afebrile with no signs or symptoms of infection.
- Respiratory support will continue with pressure-controlled assisted ventilation (PCAV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 107.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 5 cmH2O with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 107. However, there is a high likelihood of extubation failure and possible reintubation and tracheostomy if needed, versus do-not-intubate (DNI).

2. Renal Failure, Chronic: The patient has chronic renal failure and is currently on renal replacement therapy (RRT) per renal consultation. The end-goal of treatment is uncertain given no change in mental status after 48 hours.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for a total of 14 days, and other antibiotics have been discontinued due to no evidence of other infectious processes.

4. Thrombocytopenia, Acute: The patient has low platelet counts, and the cause is suspected to be drug-induced. Unnecessary medications should be stopped, and the patient should be monitored closely.

5. Anemia, Chronic: The patient has chronic anemia with a transfusion threshold of hemoglobin 7.0 g/dL. 

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has cool skin with diffuse"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including central venous catheter placement, hemodialysis catheter placement, and lumbar puncture. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 108 bpm and slightly elevated blood pressure of 125/79 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal range at 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 99% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mention of altered mental status, which is described as not delirium but a mixed toxic-metabolic process. 

The patient's physical examination reveals cool, diffuse ecchymoses on the skin and erythema and warmth in the right lower extremity, suggesting possible cellulitis. 

Laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels, chronic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 49,000/mm3, and elevated D-dimer indicating possible coagulopathy. 

The patient's imaging shows bilateral effusions and interstitial edema on chest X-ray, which may be related to their respiratory failure. 

The assessment and plan for the patient include altered mental status, respiratory failure,"

   Total time spent: 30 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with multiple organ failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown no improvement. The family has been informed about the terminal extubation and plans for comfort measures only (CMO) if there is no improvement today. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate ranging from 89 to 190 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 58 to 112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the 40-minute period of slow ventricular tachycardia that responded to analgesics. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally and 2+ extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Radiology images are not available for review. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP, which can be a serious infection of the lungs.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest can increase the risk of developing blood cl"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of multi-organ failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 58-112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 35% FiO2.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a mixed picture, with low blood pressures and high heart rates. Fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid administration. The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Coagulation studies indicate a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Other lab values, including electrolytes, glucose, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's blood cultures have been negative for C. difficile and all chest x-rays have been unremarkable.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with assist-control ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The patient's respiratory system compliance is decreased at 33.3 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally and peripheral pulses are present but not assessed. The patient's neurologic examination is nonfocal, with responses to noxious stimuli and non-purposeful movements.

The patient's medical history is significant for obesity and hypertension. The patient's family history is significant for coronary artery disease. Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent 40-minute episode of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) which responded to analgesics.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI). The family has been informed of the terminal nature of the patient's illness and plans for extubation and comfort measures only (CMO) will be implemented.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of multi-organ failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization."
