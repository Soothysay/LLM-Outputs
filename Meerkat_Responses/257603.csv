   Imaging: [**11-14**] EEG pending
   [**11-13**] CT without contrast
   FINDINGS: There is a new large 2.5 cm fluid collection in a lentiform
   [**Doctor Last Name 9874**]
   overlying the right frontoparietal area (series 105B, image 76) which
   effaces
   the sulci and causes mass effect with 8 mm of rightward shift. The
   attenuation is at the fluid level although more hyperattenuating
   strands are
   seen within this fluid collection consistent with blood. There is no
   loss of
   [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation. Ventricles on the right are of normal
   configuration. There is no depressed skull fracture. Visualized mastoid
   air
   cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are normal. The orbits
   appear
   normal.
   IMPRESSION: Lentiform left frontoparietal fluid collection measuring
   2.6 cm,
   new with mass effect. Attenuation values suggest mostly CSF densoty
   with some
   hemorrhagic elements. This may represent a subdural hygroma mostly
   containing
   CSF secondary to hypotension.
   [**11-13**] CXR portable
   IMPRESSION: Unchanged retrocardiac opacification which likely
   represents
   atelectasis and pleural effusion, although underlying infectious
   process
   cannot be excluded.

   Assessment and Plan
 MALNUTRITION
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 89 year old male with a history of
   dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for
   fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal
   episode found to have a new left sided fluid collection on head CT.
   1. Unresponsiveness: Likely due to Ativan and Dilantin in pt with ESRD
   and elderly.
   - No more sedating meds
   - Hold on Dilantin until f/u with Neurology this am
   - If doesn
t wake up may need drugs dialyzed off?
   2. Left sided intracranial fluid collection:  Unclear chronicity but pt
   has been having significant decline over past couple months. Family has
   been in discussion with neurosurgery re: burr hole and evacuation,
   however apparently they were hesitant after speaking anesthesia
   - F/u with family about whether they want to do the NSurg procedure
   - F/u with Neurology, NSurg
   - Is NPO for procedure
   - Hold SubQ heparin
   - Given Dilantin load for seizures, will hold on further administration
   due to decreased responsiveness
   3. Seizure activity:
   - Was given ativan and dilantin and is now unresponsive
   - F/u with Neurology this am
   - Repeat EEG in context of unresponsiveness
   Low grade fevers: No clear signs of infection but with suspicious
   opacity on CXR
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - Needs UA and UCx
   - Hold off on ABx for now
   -ESRD on hemodialysis: Received dialysis Saturday.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - renal consult in AM for dialysis in house
   Asthma: Stable.
   - continue Fluticasone 110 mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]
   Dementia/Malnutrition/Failure to Thrive:  Per notes, patient has had a
   substantial decline recently and has waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] mental status.
   Currently unable to respond to questions.
   - continue mirtazapine
   - will need to discuss goals of care with family
   Hypertension:
   - continue captopril 6.25 mg TID
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue simvastatin 10 mg daily
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive. The patient presented from dialysis with a syncopal episode and was found to have a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT. The patient's unresponsiveness is likely due to Ativan and Dilantin in a patient with ESRD and elderly status. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:
1. Unresponsiveness: This is likely due to the sedating medications Ativan and Dilantin, especially in an elderly patient with ESRD. It is important to hold on Dilantin until further evaluation by Neurology and consider drug dialysis if necessary.
2. Left-sided intracranial fluid collection: The chronicity of this fluid collection is unclear, but the patient has been experiencing a significant decline over the past couple of months. Neurosurgery consultation is needed to discuss the possibility of a burr hole and evacuation procedure. Anesthesia consultation should also be obtained, as there are concerns about difficulty with extubation. The patient should be NPO for the procedure and SubQ heparin should be held.
3. Seizure activity: The patient was given Ativan and Dilantin but is now unresponsive. Further evaluation by Neurology is necessary, and a repeat EEG should be done in the context of unresponsiveness.
4. Low-grade"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient experienced focal seizure activity, leading to neurology consultation. They administered ativan, which showed some improvement in seizure activity. It was recommended to load dilantin prior to the expected burr hole procedure. However, the 5pm dilantin level was high at 17.7, correcting to 41.2 due to albumin of 3.3 and low Cr clearance. Dilantin was not given further that night, and the neuro team was reassessed in the morning.

The family gave consent for the neurosurgical procedure, but expressed concern about the possibility of difficulty extubating the patient.

The patient has several allergies, including iodine, aspirin, NSAIDs, E-Mycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and phenylephrine.

The patient is currently on various medications, including dilantin, and receives other ICU medications. There are also ongoing infusions and other medications being administered.

There are no changes reported in the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent seizure activity.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/60 to 165/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

   [**Doctor Last Name 9874**]
   overlying the right frontoparietal area (series 105B, image 76) which
   effaces
   the sulci and causes mass effect with 8 mm of rightward shift. The
   attenuation is at the fluid level although more hyperattenuating
   strands are
   seen within this fluid collection consistent with blood. There is no
   loss of
   [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation. Ventricles on the right are of normal
   configuration. There is no depressed skull fracture. Visualized mastoid
   air
   cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are normal. The orbits
   appear
   normal.
   IMPRESSION: Lentiform left frontoparietal fluid collection measuring
   2.6 cm,
   new with mass effect. Attenuation values suggest mostly CSF densoty
   with some
   hemorrhagic elements. This may represent a subdural hygroma mostly
   containing
   CSF secondary to hypotension.
   [**11-13**] CXR portable
   IMPRESSION: Unchanged retrocardiac opacification which likely
   represents
   atelectasis and pleural effusion, although underlying infectious
   process
   cannot be excluded.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive, presented from dialysis with a syncopal episode.
- A new left-sided fluid collection was found on head CT.
- The patient is currently unresponsive to voice or sternal rub.
- EEG showed focal seizure activity, and neurology recommended ativan and dilantin loading prior to the expected burr hole procedure.
- The patient's dilantin level was 17.7, which corrected to 41.2 due to albumin and low Cr clearance. Further dilantin will not be given tonight, and the neuro team will reassess in the morning.
- Family gave consent to neurosurgery for the procedure but expressed concern about potential difficulties with extubation.
- The patient has a history of allergies to iodine, aspirin, NSAIDs, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and phenylephrine.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.8°C (100°F), HR: 93 bpm (84-102), BP: 153/60 mmHg (115/43-165/109), RR: 28 breaths/min (13-32), SpO2: 93%.

","The patient is an 89-year-old man with a subdural hematoma, midline shift, decline in mental status/worsened encephalopathy (temporally associated with anti-epileptic medication), and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The patient's condition requires immediate attention, as there is a plan to take him to the operating room for surgical drainage of the subdural hematoma. If surgery cannot be performed soon, an urgent re-CT scan is needed in the morning to assess the progression of the hematoma. Additionally, it is important to check arterial blood gas (ABG) and venous blood gas (VBG) to exclude hypercarbia. The dosing of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) should be reviewed with the neurology team. Hemodialysis is required today or tomorrow, considering the patient's renal condition. Stress ulcer prophylaxis is necessary due to the intracranial process and end-stage renal disease. Other issues will be addressed according to the ICU team's note."

","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive. He presented from dialysis with a syncopal episode and was found to have a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT. 

The patient is currently unresponsive and has poor air movement in the lungs. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 143/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
 MALNUTRITION
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 89 year old male with a history of
   dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for
   fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal
   episode found to have a new left sided fluid collection on head CT.
   Drained yesterday, now with tachypnea.
   1. Unresponsiveness: Likely due to medications in pt with ESRD and
   elderly but concerning for worsening intracranial process.  His CT head
   this morning shows air, which per neurosurgery is reassuring and shows
   room for brain re-expansion.
   - No more sedating meds
   - Hold on Dilantin until f/u with Neurology this am
 the drug seems to
   be making him more sedated.
   - Get stat head CT again during the day today if neuro exam seems to be
   worsening.
   2. Tachypnea: His exam is concerning for stridor.  His O2 saturations
   have been normal, and he does not have secretions or cough to suggest a
   new pneumonia.  Also has history of asthma.
   - CXR for new process.
   - bedside bronchoscopy to assess for cause of stridor.
   - Talk to neurosurgery about a possible central source.
   - Will try giving bronchodilators.
   3. Left sided intracranial fluid collection:  Drained in OR yesterday.
   Unclear chronicity but pt has been having significant decline over past
   couple months. Per neurosurgery brain will take time to re-expand as
   this was a chronic process.
   - F/u with Neurology, NSurg regarding further recs.
   - Will likely restart phenytoin.
   - Is NPO for procedure
   4. Seizure activity:
   - Currently not following commands but does not appear to be seizing.
   - f/u phenytoin level to decide on further doses.
   5. ESRD on hemodialysis: Received dialysis Saturday.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - plan for dialysis in ICU today.  Will hold off on treating
   hyperkalemia until then.
   Dementia/Malnutrition/Failure to Thrive:  Per notes, patient has had a
   substantial decline recently and has waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] mental status.
   Currently unable to respond to questions.
   - continue mirtazapine
   - will need to discuss goals of care with family
   Hypertension:
   - continue captopril 6.25 mg TID
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue simvastatin 10 mg daily
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, bowel regimen, H2 blocker
   Access: peripherals
   Code:  DNR/DNI.  Per discussion with wife, she would not want heroic
   measures and understands the significant risks involved with surgery
   that was done.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive. He presents with a syncopal episode found to have a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT, which was drained yesterday. The patient is currently unresponsive, likely due to medications in his condition and advanced age. There is concern for worsening intracranial process, but the CT head shows air, indicating room for brain re-expansion.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 143/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His physical examination shows that he opens his eyes to voice but does not follow commands, has pupils that are 5mm bilaterally and constrict to light, breathes loudly with expiratory grunting, and has poor to fair air movement in the lungs with a significant systolic murmur on the left side.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including malnutrition, subdural hemorrhage, and dementia. He is currently experiencing unresponsiveness, tachypnea, and a left-sided intracranial fluid collection. The assessment and plan include holding off on Dilantin until further evaluation by neurology, getting a stat head CT during the day if the"
