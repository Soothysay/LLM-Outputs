   Assessment and Plan
   32F with hx asthma who is transferred from OSH with status asthmaticus,
   admitted to the MICU for continued management.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress, status.  Pt appears more comfortable,
   although still wheezing, moving fair amount of air.  ABG with pCO2
   stable in 40s. Elevated pCO2 concerning in asthmatic patient, will need
   close monitoring for fatiguing.
   - CTA negative from OSH
   - Continue Solumedrol 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Received magnesium
   - Continuous nebs (albuterol), also on atrovent and advair
   - Advance to clears
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - urine legionella negative
   - Pertussis (cough, episode of post-tussive emesis, child at home with
   cough) sent
   - Will start Azithromycin in case of atypical infection given
   persistent hypoxia despite 24h of steroids/nebs
   - a-line for ABG monitoring
   - Consider heliox, NIPPV if pCO2 rises
   - If not improving consider re-imaging
   .
   2. Positive blood cx. GPC in pairs & chains, possible contaminant but
   identified as ENTEROCOCCUS, pt afebrile with leukocytosis in setting of
   steroids.
   - Started vanco, re-cultured
   - F/U repeat cx
   .
   3. Hyperglycemia. No hx Diabetes, but BS elevated. Given steroid use,
   expect BS to possibly rise.
   - RISS
   .
   4. Anxiety. Hx of high doses of valium, confirmed with pt's pharmacy.
   Given respiratory status, concering to administer benzos. Received one
   dose of 10mg overnight with improvement.
   - CIWA scale to monitor for signs of withdrawal
   - Switch to Ativan prn since shorter acting
   .
   5. Crohn's Disease. Not active x years.
   - NTD
   .
   6. Chest pain. Atypical for cardiac ischemia, lasting less than 5
   minutes and sharp. Initial EKG around time of pain was sinus with TWI
   in V2, V3, no STE. Approximately one hour later, similar but now TW
   more biphasic. Compared to admission EKG, TW changes appear different.
   - Cycle CE although low suspicion for active ischemia
   - Non-specific changes can be seen in PE, but CTA from OSH negative
   (for central PE) and clinical picture not consistent with PE.
   .
   Ppx: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old female with a history of asthma who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for status asthmaticus. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and is still wheezing, although she appears more comfortable. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a stable partial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO2) in the 40s, which is concerning in asthmatic patients. Close monitoring for fatigue is needed.

The patient's allergies include metronidazole, nausea/vomiting, and sulfonamides. She has received one dose of 10 mg of valium due to anxiety. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 107/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87% on aerosol-cool delivery device.

The patient has been started on Vancomycin pending speciation after identifying Enterococcus in blood culture from 08/31. Her white blood cell count is elevated at 21.3 K/uL, hematocrit is 41.0%, platelet count is 303 K/uL, creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T is less than 0.01. Other lab results include glucose levels of 205 mg/dL and 189 mg/dL, lactic acid of 1.9 mmol/L, calcium of 8.7 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.6 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.7 mg/dL. The chest X-ray shows improved aeration without clear infiltrates.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory distress, close monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory fatigue, and consideration of heliox or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) if pCO2 rises. The patient is also being monitored for sputum and blood cultures, as well as urine for Legionella. Azithromycin has been started due to persistent hypoxia despite 24 hours of steroids/nebs. The patient's anxiety has been addressed with a single dose of valium, and benzodiazepine withdrawal is being monitored using the CIWA scale. The patient's hyperglycemia will be monitored closely due to steroid use. Lastly, the patient has a history of Crohn's disease and chest pain that is atypical for cardiac ischemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Worsening respiratory distress and fatigue, potentially requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Persistent hypoxia despite treatment, which may necessitate alternative interventions such as heliox or NIPPV.
3. Infection, given the positive blood culture for Enterococcus and ongoing monitoring of sputum and urine cultures.
4. Hyperglycemia due to steroid use.
5. Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.
6. Possible exacerbation of Crohn's disease.
7. Cardiac ischemia, although less likely based on the description of the chest pain and initial EKG findings."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of allergies to metronidazole, nausea/vomiting, and sulfa (sulfonamides). He is currently receiving treatment with Vancomycin for an infection, as indicated by blood cultures showing GPC pairs & chains.

The patient experienced transient sharp left chest pain at 330 AM, with new twigs in V2-V4 compared to the admission EKG. Partial resolution of changes occurred, and the patient did not have any further symptoms. The patient also received one dose of 10 mg Valium due to anxiety.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.7°C (98°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 79 bpm with a range of 79-105 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 107/55 mmHg with a range of 73-137/130 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute with a range of 16-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 87%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR).

The patient's weight remains unchanged at 153.5 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,709 mL and a total output of 550 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,159 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, with an SpO2 of 87%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 158.

The patient's physical examination reveals warm, dry, well-perfused skin with no rashes. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 21.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 41.0%, platelet count (Plt) at 303 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T at <0.01, and lactic acid at 1.9 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and presence of GPC pairs & chains in the blood culture suggest an ongoing infection. The patient is currently receiving Vancomycin, which indicates a possible bacterial infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and lab results is essential to identify any worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.

2. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient's chest pain and EKG changes raise concern for an MI. Although troponin-T levels are"

   1.  Respiratory distress, status.  Pt appears more comfortable,
   although still wheezing, moving fair amount of air.  ABG with pCO2
   stable in 40s. Elevated pCO2 concerning in asthmatic patient, will need
   close monitoring for fatiguing.
   - CTA negative from OSH
   - Continue Solumedrol 80 IV q 8
   - Received magnesium
   - Continuous nebs (albuterol), also on atrovent and advair
   - NPO for now pending improvement
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - urine legionella but low suspicion
   - Pertussis (cough, episode of post-tussive emesis, child at home with
   cough)
   - Hold further abx given no infiltrates on CT
   - a-line for ABG monitoring
   - Consider heliox, NIPPV if pCO2 rises
   - If not improving consider re-imaging

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of asthma who was admitted to the MICU for status asthmaticus. He has been transferred from another hospital and is currently experiencing respiratory distress. The patient's arterial line was started on 08/31/2114 at 03:24 PM, and an EKG was performed on 09/01/2114 at 03:52 AM. Blood cultures were taken on the same day. The patient received one dose of 10mg valium due to anxiety and is currently on Vancomycin pending speciation. He has a history of allergies to metronidazole, nausea/vomiting, and sulfa (sulfonamides), as well as an unknown allergy. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin at 12:01 AM on 09/01/2114. He is receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98%), heart rate of 79-105 bpm, blood pressure of 107/55 mmHg (73-137/130 mmHg), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (16-28), oxygen saturation of 87%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 153.5 kg (admission: 153.5 kg). Fluid balance shows a total in of 4,709 mL, including 268 mL of IV fluids, and a total out of 550 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device with an SpO2 of 87% and ABG results of 7.36/43/78 with PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 158. Physical examination reveals warm, dry, well-perfused skin without rashes. Lab results indicate elevated WBC count of 21.3 K/uL, Hct of 41.0%, Plt of 303 K/uL, Cr of 0.8-0.7 mg/dL, TropT of <0.01, TCO2 of 28-29 mmHg, Glucose of 205-189 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old female with a history of asthma, Crohn's disease, and smoking. She is currently in the ICU due to an asthma exacerbation and other medical complications. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She is receiving multiple medications, including corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics. Her blood cultures have shown gram-positive cocci pairs and chains, but this is likely a contaminant. The patient also has hyperglycemia, which is being monitored and managed. She is anxious, but not currently on high-dose valium due to concerns of respiratory depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's asthma is currently worsening despite treatment. If not properly managed, she may experience respiratory distress or failure.
2. Chest pain with EKG changes: The patient had chest pain with EKG changes, which could indicate a cardiac issue. This should be monitored closely to rule out any cardiac complications.
3. Positive blood culture: Although the blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci pairs and chains, they are likely a contaminant. However, if the infection spreads or if the organism is later identified as a pathogen, it could lead to sepsis or other bloodstream infections.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, which can increase the risk of infection and delayed wound healing. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
5. Anxiety: The patient is"

","The patient is a 32-year-old female with a history of asthma, Crohn's disease, and smoker. She is currently in the ICU for an asthma exacerbation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/66 mmHg to 143/130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on several medications including heparin sodium, valium, citalopram, Advair, omeprazole, HCTZ, and others.

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She has an arterial line in place and has undergone blood cultures. The patient's arterial blood gas results show persistent hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Her EKG demonstrated new twigs V2-V4.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dL, blood glucose level of 205 mg/dL, and elevated C-reactive protein level of 41.0%. The patient's imaging reveals low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the right middle lobe.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of her asthma exacerbation, ruling out coronary artery disease, addressing a potential bloodstream infection, managing hyperglycemia, treating anxiety, and"

   32 yo female with obesity, asthma admitted with status asthmaticus with
   recent sick contact (son). Overnight she was treated with continuous
   nebs with slight improvement today. Afebrile, conversant in full
   sentences with no accessory muscle use. O2 sats 93% RA. Lungs with fair
   air movement, diffuse insp and exp wheezes. HR mildly tachycardic, no
   murmurs. Abdomen obese, soft +bs. Ext no edema.
   No worsening with status asthmaticus though she remains mildly hypoxic
   with high nebulizer requirement. Will attempt to wean down neb
   frequency as tolerated, and continue steroids. Azithromycin added for
   possible atypical infection. Plans otherwise as per above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old female with obesity, asthma, and a history of Crohn's disease. She was admitted with status asthmaticus and has been treated with continuous nebulizers, showing slight improvement. The patient is currently afebrile, conversant, and in no respiratory distress. Her oxygen saturation is at 90% on RA, and her lungs show diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. The patient has mild tachycardia, no murmurs, and a soft abdomen. There is no evidence of peripheral edema. She remains mildly hypoxic with high nebulizer requirements. The plan is to decrease the frequency of nebulizers as tolerated, continue steroids, and add azithromycin for possible atypical infection. Other plans remain unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's asthma is currently uncontrolled, and there is a risk of further exacerbation. Close monitoring and adjustment of treatment may be necessary.
2. Infection: Although the blood culture is likely a contaminant, the patient is at risk for developing an infection due to her prolonged hospital stay and immunocompromised state. Empiric coverage with antibiotics should be continued until the source of infection is identified.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This can increase the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or poor wound healing"

   1.  Respiratory distress, status.  Pt appears more comfortable,
   improving although still wheezing, moving fair amount of air.  ABG with
   pCO2 stable in 40s since arrival in MICU, suspect some component of
   obesity hypoventilation.
   - CTA negative from OSH
   - Switch to prednisone 60 qd
   - Spaced to q 4H nebs but hypoxic off oxygen
   - Also on atrovent and advair
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - urine legionella negative
   - Pertussis (cough, episode of post-tussive emesis, child at home with
   cough) sent
   - Azithromycin in case of atypical infection given persistent hypoxia
   despite 24h of steroids/nebs
   - d/c a-line as ABGs stable and likely call-out
   - Consider heliox, NIPPV if pCO2 rises
   - If not improving consider re-imaging
   .
   2. Positive blood cx. GPC in pairs & chains, possible contaminant but
   identified as ENTEROCOCCUS, pt afebrile with leukocytosis in setting of
   steroids.
   - Switched to Ampicillin, re-cultured
   - F/U repeat cx
   .
   3. Hyperglycemia. No hx Diabetes, but BS elevated. Given steroid use,
   expect BS to possibly rise.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. Upon admission, the patient had elevated white blood cell count and fever, suggesting an infectious process. The initial EKG was negative for any cardiac issues. The patient was started on Solumedrol 40 mg and Azithromycin, with a change in antibiotic therapy from Vancomycin to Ampicillin due to sensitivity. The patient also received social work support for coping.

Vital signs remained relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range and blood pressure within acceptable limits. The patient's heart rhythm was sinus rhythm, and he had a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight remained unchanged since admission.

Fluid balance showed an intake of 2200 mL and output of 1300 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient received 770 mL of oral fluids, 535 mL of intravenous fluids, and 100 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Blood products were not administered, and the patient's urine output was within normal limits.

The patient required respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, maintaining an SpO2 of 93%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results showed a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 40, PaO2 of 73, and HCO3- of 27. The ABG also indicated a respiratory acidosis with a compensated metabolic alkalosis.

Physical examination revealed no abnormalities in the general appearance, HEENT, or abdomen. However, wheezing was heard bilaterally in the lungs, and the patient's extremities were weak and without edema.

Laboratory results showed elevated leukocyte count, slightly elevated glucose levels, and decreased platelet count. The patient's electrolytes were within normal range, except for a slightly low magnesium level. The chest X-ray showed no significant findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's initial presentation with fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests an infectious process. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection, such as increased fever or changes in sputum culture, is crucial.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for respiratory support indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABG values will help assess the patient's respiratory status.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake-output difference of 900 mL over the past 24 hours. Close monitoring of fluid status and adjusting the fluid regimen accordingly may be necessary to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.
4. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, it is essential to monitor for any signs of hypotension, especially during weaning off respiratory support or changes in medication.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized in the ICU, there is a risk for DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium infusion should be continued to prevent clot formation.
6. Delirium or Cognitive Impairment: The patient's weak and weak extremities, along with the need for respiratory support, may increase the risk of delirium or cognitive impairment. Frequent assessments of mental status and providing appropriate stimulation and communication are important.

It is crucial to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of asthma who was transferred to the MICU for the management of status asthmaticus. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, although he appears more comfortable and is improving. He continues to wheeze but is moving a fair amount of air. His ABG shows a stable pCO2 in the 40s, with an elevated pCO2 which is concerning in asthmatic patients and requires close monitoring for fatiguing.

The patient has been given Solumedrol 40mg, magnesium, continuous nebs (albuterol), spacing to q 4H nebs but hypoxic off oxygen, atrovent, and advair. He is being advanced to clears and will have follow-up sputum cultures and blood cultures. The urine Legionella test is negative. Azithromycin has been started in case of atypical infection given persistent hypoxia despite 24h of steroids/nebs. The patient is on a-line for ABG monitoring and may consider heliox, NIPPV if pCO2 rises. If not improving, re-imaging may be considered.

The patient also has a positive blood culture showing Enterococcus, which was initially identified as GPC in pairs & chains, possible contaminant but re-cultured and switched to Ampicillin. Hyperglycemia is present without a history of diabetes, possibly due to steroid use. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease and asthma. She presented with severe asthma exacerbation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments for her conditions. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/58 mmHg to 155/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for wheezing. 

The patient's laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL and a decreased hematocrit level of 41.0%. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging reveals clear lung volumes on chest X-ray without any infiltrates. The patient has been prescribed several medications, including prednisone, albuterol, atrovent nebs, supplemental oxygen, azithromycin, and ampicillin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's severe asthma exacerbation may lead to respiratory distress, hypoxia, and potential respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Enterococcus blood culture: The presence of enterococcus in the blood culture indicates a potential bloodstream infection, which can be serious if not treated promptly.
3. Hyperglycemia"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease and asthma. She presents with severe asthma exacerbation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure of 112/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on various medications including celexa, advair, omeprazole, hctz, heparin, rissole, atrovent, solumedrol, azithromycin, and ampicillin.

The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status, with reduced wheezing. However, she still experiences hypoxia on movement. She has a history of obesity hypoventilation and potential sleep apnea. Her asthma is likely hyperreactive. The plan is to decrease glucocorticoid (GC) to prednisone 60 qday, continue albuterol and atrovent nebs every 4 hours, provide supplemental oxygen as needed, administer azithromycin for 5 days, and follow up with sputum and pertussis cultures. The use of aline will be discontinued.

The patient also has an enterococcus blood culture, which is atypical for a contaminant. Therefore, it is important to continue with"
