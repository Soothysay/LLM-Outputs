","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with severe bullous emphysema and cor pulmonale. He was admitted for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient had an episode of hypoxia and mental status changes after receiving hyperoxia therapy. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98%), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 98/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen and has been placed on BiPAP to manage his respiratory failure. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's lactic acid level is elevated. 

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired peripheral pulses and skin assessment. Neurologic assessment is also impaired due to the patient's mental status changes. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which needs to be addressed.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly exacerbated by pulmonary edema and cor pulmonale. Management includes continuing COPD management with azithromycin, prednisone,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with impaired skin integrity and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various medications, including PPI, lasix, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/67 to 114/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient is on a nasally cannula for oxygen support. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and blood products are within normal limits. However, the patient's ABG results indicate hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. The patient's neurological assessment is incomplete. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased hematocrit and potassium levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an 18-gauge and a 20-gauge line. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk of worsening respiratory distress. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support should be provided.
2. Infection: The elevated white"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with severe bullous emphysema and cor pulmonale. He was admitted to the MICU for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has improved, with improved mental status and oxygenation on 1-2L NC. He continues to receive COPD management with azithromycin, prednisone, and nebs. The goal is to maintain SaO2 between 86-88%. The patient also has L diastolic heart failure in the setting of right heart failure and has diuresed 3L during the ICU stay on lasix gtt. He will transition to IV lasix and continue digoxin therapy. Cardiology follow-up is needed as an outpatient. Pulmonary will follow on the floor. Smoking cessation counseling is ongoing. The patient has LE burns and will continue silver sulfadiazine cream. Goals of care are ongoing discussions with the family regarding follow-up after hospitalization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of severe bullous emphysema and cor pulmonale, which can lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient may develop pulmonary edema due to left diastolic heart failure in the setting of right heart failure. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload, such as increased JVP or decreased lung sounds,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of bullous emphysema, presenting with progressive shortness of breath and respiratory failure. The patient likely has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cor pulmonale. He is currently in the ICU and has been on supplemental oxygen, with an overnight oxygen saturation (SaO2) ranging from 82-90%. The patient has been receiving IV lasix for diuresis, digoxin, and prophylactic heparin. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 108/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 85%. The patient has diminished breath sounds, right and left lower extremity edema, and muscle wasting. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and normal glucose levels. The patient's assessment and plan include managing hypercarbic respiratory failure, smoking cessation, and treatment for burns. The patient is to be transferred to the floor with continued pulmonary service follow-up.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged or worsening respiratory failure leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with severe bullous emphysema and cor pulmonale who was admitted to the MICU for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been diuresing well on IV lasix boluses and has shown improvement in mental status and oxygenation. He is currently on 1-2L NC and has not required bipap since admission.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has two burn ulcers on the lower extremities. The plan is to continue silver sulfadiazine cream.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is a chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure patient, likely with pulmonary edema secondary to cor pulmonale. CO2 levels are improving after bipap, and the patient's mental status is stable. The goal is to maintain SaO2 between 86-88% and continue COPD management with azithromycin (day #4), prednisone, and nebs. Smoking cessation counseling will be continued.
3. Cor pulmonale: The patient has developed left diastolic heart failure in the setting of right heart failure. Effusions have been noted, and digoxin has been started. The plan is to continue IV lasix with a goal of 2L out, continue digoxin, and consider right heart catheterization with NO/sildenafil challenge once adequately diuresed"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with severe bullous emphysema and cor pulmonale. He was admitted to the MICU for the management of hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has not required BiPAP since admission. The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure (acute on chronic), cor pulmonale, left diastolic heart failure in the setting of right heart failure, and LE burns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and worsening hypoxemia.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cor pulmonale and left diastolic heart failure suggest a risk for cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure exacerbation.
3. Wound Infections: The impaired skin integrity and lower extremity (LE) burns increase the risk of wound infections, especially if proper wound care is not maintained.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines can increase the risk of developing DVT.
5. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes and likelihood of previous hypoxia may predispose him to delirium.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided progress note."

The patient is a 61-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cor pulmonale who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypercapnic respiratory failure. He has been on and off BiPAP, and his respiratory status has improved. The patient's allergies are unknown, and he has been receiving azithromycin and heparin prophylaxis. His medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged except for cardiovascular edema and decreased dyspnea. The patient appears comfortable and is not in pain. Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs, fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and SpO2 of 100%. His ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals a thin appearance, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and diminished breath sounds. The patient has soft, non-tender abdominal examination and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as decreased creatinine and glucose levels. Other labs indicate normal electrolyte levels and kidney function. Assessment and plan include transferring the patient to the floor, monitoring bicarbonate levels, and conducting a thoracic CT scan. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and communication. The patient's code status is full code"
