   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: 51 yo man with IBD, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who
   presents from [**Hospital6 6222**] with pneumonia and respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: Likely in the setting of acute
   pulmonary process, like acute bacterial pneumonia. Community acquired
   most likely, especially given GPC growing in sputum at [**Hospital3 9141**]. Pt w/ [**Last Name (un) 7645**] dx of PAP putting him at higher risk as well for
   PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 9142**]. No sign of PAP flare given mainly unilateral disease on
   his CXR.
   - ARDS type ventilation w/ low TV given poor oxygenation/?bilateral dz,
   AC - 6cc/hg
   - Repeat CXR
   - sputum, BAL cultures - specify modified [**Name Initial (NameIs) 688**] for [**Name Initial (NameIs) 9142**], PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Legionella Ag
   - f/u cx data (including blood cx) from [**Hospital3 **]
   - broadly cover w/ vancomycin, aztreonam (cannot use ceftriaxone given
   amox allergy --> hives)
   - CT Chest without contrast
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypovolemia vs. sepsis. Responded well to NS boluses,
   still on low dose of neo drip. No reason to have adrenal insufficiency.
   [**Month (only) 8**] also be contributed by propofol drip
   - IVF bolus - NS x 3 L, reeval
   - Fentanyl/midaz drips in place of propofol
   - Neo drip, titrate to MAP > 60 for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Suspect this is due to hypovolemia, sepsis. Will
   give back fluids and recheck creatinine in the morning. If still high,
   will complete w/u --> urine lytes/sediment.renal U/S
   .
   # EKG changes: Some nonspecific ST segment abnormalities on lateral
   leads. No risk factors for CAD

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP).
- He was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- His current condition includes respiratory failure/pneumonia, hypotension, acute renal failure, EKG changes, and hypothyroidism.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with ARDS-type ventilation due to poor oxygenation.
- He received fluid boluses for hypotension and is responding well.
- Cultures have been taken, including sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and blood cultures.
- Broad coverage antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin and aztreonam.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a high neutrophil count, elevated lactate levels, and renal dysfunction.
- Imaging studies, such as a repeat chest X-ray, CT chest without contrast, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), have been ordered.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is on mechanical ventilation with ARDS-type ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: 51 yo man with IBD, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who
   presents from [**Hospital6 6222**] with pneumonia and respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: Likely secondary to acute infectious
   pneumonia in setting of chronic lung disease.  Cx from outside
   hospital  Community acquired most likely, especially given GPC growing
   in sputum at [**Hospital6 6222**]. Studies for Nocardia and PCP
   are pending.
   - cx data from OSH hospital suggestive of 3+ presumptive Strep PNA and
   strep bacteremia;  D/c vanc and aztreonam; continue levofloxacin (strep
   in blood from OSH is sensitive to levoquin; sensitivities of strep from
   sputum is pending)
   - Follow sputum and BAL cultures - specify modified AFB for Nocardia,
   PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Follow repeat CXR from this AM
 consolidation appears worsened
   - Follow up CT Chest without contrast
   - Switching from ARDS type ventilation protocol to pressure support;
   decreasing PEEP to 8 to reduce compounding of hypotension
   - No need for whole lung lavage as unclear how much PAP is playing a
   role in current presentation; unilaterl disease makes it less likely;
   consider sending out GM-CSF antibodies
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to hypovolemia or underlying sepsis.
   No evidence for poor perfusion on physical exam; creatinines have been
   resolving
   -Can check mixed venous O2 sat to differentiate hypovolemia from
   distributive hypotension:  mixed venous O2 sat is 98% (high) more
   suggestive of distributive picture.  Continue to treat underlying
   infection.
   -Continue maintainence fluids and give IV fluid boluses as necessary
   -Has not required pressors; keep neo drip and titrate to MAP > 60
   .
   #Anemia: Hematocrit has trended down.  Check afternoon HCT.  Likely
   secondary to fluid boluses this AM and multiple blood draws.
   -Guiaic all stools
   -Repeat HCT this PM; transfusion goal of 20
   -hold on any iron studies given that this is more likely an acute
   change rather than a chronic process
   .
   #Pericardial effusion
 Unlikely due to volume overload given that
   there are no pleural effusions.  Could be secondary to infectious
   etiology (in setting of strep pneumonia) so would check troponins X 2
   today.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   -Resolving, was likely prerenal given response to fluids, trend Cr
   .
   # EKG changes: Some nonspecific ST segment abnormalities on lateral
   leads. No risk factors for CAD
   -1X troponins negative; echo does not show any wall abnormalities
   -no events on telemetry

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who presented with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient likely has community-acquired pneumonia, especially considering the growth of Gram-positive cocci in the sputum at the outside hospital. Sensitivities of the streptococcus pneumoniae (Strep PNA) from the blood culture are pending, and the patient will continue receiving levofloxacin, as it is sensitive to this antibiotic. Further studies for Nocardia and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) are pending.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to hypovolemia or underlying sepsis. There is no evidence of poor perfusion on physical examination, and creatinine levels have been resolving. Mixed venous O2 saturation is high, suggesting a distributive hypotension picture. The patient should continue to receive maintenance fluids and IV fluid boluses as necessary. Pressors have not been required, but the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained above 60.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has trended down, likely due to fluid boluses and multiple blood draws. A guaiac test should be performed on stools"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of inflammatory bowel disease and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. He presented to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure/pneumonia, hypotension, acute renal failure, EKG changes, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may worsen if there is a progression of respiratory failure, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The presence of suspected Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia and pneumonia increases the risk of sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function may deteriorate if there is inadequate perfusion or ongoing renal insult, leading to further impairment in kidney function.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's EKG changes and history of hypothyroidism raise concerns for potential cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or ischemic events.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP, which can be caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Early identification and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent this complication.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the"

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. He was admitted to the ICU from another hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure likely secondary to acute infectious pneumonia, possibly community-acquired. There are pending studies for Nocardia and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). The patient self-extubated last night but was put back on high-flow oxygen, which is currently at 80% with a blood gas showing pH 7.40, PaCO2 41, and SaO2 96%. Levofloxacin has been continued as the patient's sputum culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae sensitive to levofloxacin. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures have been ordered, including modified AFB for Nocardia and PCP. A repeat chest X-ray showed worsening consolidation. A bronchoscopy was performed with the aspiration of a large mucus plug. 

The patient also has hypotension likely secondary to underlying sepsis/distributive shock, with a high MVO2. The patient's anemia is likely due to fluid boluses and multiple blood draws.

   are pending.
   -Currently on high Flow O2.  SpO2 is 95%, Follow blood gas, continue on
   high-flow mask and wean off O2 as tolerated.
   - cx data from OSH hospital suggestive of 3+ presumptive Strep PNA and
   strep bacteremia; continue levofloxacin (strep in blood and sptum from
   OSH is sensitive to levoquin;)
   - Follow sputum and BAL cultures - specify modified AFB for Nocardia,
   PCP

   - bronchoscopy performed with aspiration of large mucus plug; consider
   starting chest PT, mucolytics
   - No need for whole lung lavage as unclear how much PAP is playing a
   role in current presentation; unilateral disease makes it less likely;
   consider sending out GM-CSF antibodies
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to underlying sepsis/distributive shock
   given high MVO2.

   -HCTs were stable over past 24 hours
   -hold on any iron studies given that this is more likely an acute
   change rather than a chronic process
   #Pericardial effusion
 Unlikely due to volume overload given that
   there are no pleural effusions.  Could be secondary to infectious
   etiology (in setting of strep pneumonia); no signs of tamponade.

   51 yo man with IBD, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who presents from

   # Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: Likely secondary to acute infectious
   pneumonia in setting of chronic lung disease.  Cx from outside
   hospital  Community acquired most likely, especially given GPC growing
   in sputum at [**Hospital6 6222**]. Studies for Nocardia and PCP
   are pending.
   -Currently on high Flow O2.  SpO2 is 95%, Follow blood gas, continue on
   high-flow mask and wean off O2 as tolerated.
   - cx data from OSH hospital suggestive of 3+ presumptive Strep PNA and
   strep bacteremia; continue levofloxacin (strep in blood and sptum from
   OSH is sensitive to levoquin;)
   - Follow sputum and BAL cultures - specify modified AFB for Nocardia,
   PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Follow repeat CXR from this AM
 not significantly changed from
   prior, possibly improved aeration in LL lung
   - bronchoscopy performed with aspiration of large mucus plug; consider
   starting chest PT, mucolytics
   - No need for whole lung lavage as unclear how much PAP is playing a
   role in current presentation; unilateral disease makes it less likely;
   consider sending out GM-CSF antibodies
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to underlying sepsis/distributive shock
   given high MVO2.
   -Continue to tx underlying infection as above
   -Continue maintainence fluids
   -Has not required pressors; titrate to MAP > 60
   #Mental Status changes - [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to sepsis, however, improving
   from his infection stand point.
   - Thyroid levels checked - T3, T4 levels low.  However, in setting of
   acute illness not reliable.
   - replete lytes
   - No signs of meningismus, LP deferred
   #Anemia: Hematocrit has trended down.  Check afternoon HCT.  Likely
   secondary to fluid boluses this AM and multiple blood draws.
   -HCTs were stable over past 24 hours
   -hold on any iron studies given that this is more likely an acute
   change rather than a chronic process
   - check stool guiac
   #Pericardial effusion
 Unlikely due to volume overload given that
   there are no pleural effusions.  Could be secondary to infectious
   etiology (in setting of strep pneumonia); no signs of tamponade.
   -troponins negative, making an infectious process less likely
   # Acute renal failure:  Resolved, likely prerenal given response to
   fluids, trend Cr
   # EKG changes: Some nonspecific ST segment abnormalities on lateral
   leads. No risk factors for CAD
   -1X troponins negative; echo does not show any wall abnormalities

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. He was admitted to the ICU with streptococcus pneumonia pneumonia, bacteremia, and respiratory failure. He is currently extubated but experiencing new mental status changes since yesterday.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 139/73 to 161/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow mask.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL, sodium level of 146 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The chest X-ray reveals left lower lobe pneumonia, possibly improving right-sided opacities more consistent with pulmonary edema.

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin) for suspected Streptococcus pneumonia infection, which is sensitive to this medication. Blood and sputum cultures are pending, with studies for Nocardia and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia also planned.

They have mental status changes, but these have improved overnight. The patient is confused and agitated, receiving 0.5 mg IV ativan for agitation earlier in the morning. The patient expresses a desire to eat, stating they are ""starving."" The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and hives. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/75 to 156/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the left mid lung zone and left base. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and analgesics. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.0, slightly decreased hemoglobin at 9.5 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of PAP (possibly referring to pulmonary arterial hypertension) who was admitted with S.P. pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis. The patient has been febrile, improving mental status, and experiencing chest pain episodes. He has been treated with various antibiotics and medications, including nebulizers for wheezing and acetaminophen for fever. The patient's vital signs have fluctuated, with a high temperature, slightly elevated blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation level is at 93%. The patient has a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg and has received a total of 2,751 mL of fluids since 12 AM. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet levels, and normal troponin-T levels. Imaging reveals worsened right perihilar consolidation and contralateral spreading pneumonia, stabilized right lung edema, and slightly improved left lung consolidation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient has secondary respiratory failure due to a florid pneumonia in the setting of chronic lung disease (PAP). This condition requires continuous monitoring of respiratory status on high flow O2 mask with periodic ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes are likely secondary to the underlying septic picture. If these changes continue or progress"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of PAP admitted to the ICU for suspected pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis. The patient's temperature has been febrile at 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. There have been improvements in mental status, as the patient is now on a regular diet and off restraints. The patient experienced an episode of CP (cardiac pulse) at 0100, but it suddenly ended. An ECG showed no abnormalities, and creatine kinase (CK) levels were negative. The patient was given nebulizer for wheezing and acetaminophen for fever.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient has respiratory failure due to a severe pneumonia, which is worsened by chronic lung disease (PAP). The consolidation is spreading to the contralateral lung.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes are likely secondary to sepsis. Although the CT head performed on 10/4 was negative for any acute process, the LP (lumbar puncture) is still being deferred due to improving mental status and absence of clinical signs suggestive of meningitis.
3. Pericardial Effusion: The etiology of the pericardial effusion is unclear, although it was initially attributed to a possible infectious process. Negative troponins and absence of hemodynamic compromise suggestive of tamponade indicate that the effusion may"

   51 yo man with IBD, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who presents from
   [**Hospital6 6222**] with pneumonia and respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: Likely secondary to acute infectious
   pneumonia in setting of chronic lung disease.  Cx from outside
   hospital  Community acquired most likely, especially given GPC growing
   in sputum at [**Hospital6 6222**]. Studies for Nocardia and PCP
   are pending.
   -Currently on high Flow O2.  SpO2 is 95%, Follow blood gas, continue on
   high-flow mask and wean off O2 as tolerated.
   - cx data from OSH hospital suggestive of 3+ presumptive Strep PNA and
   strep bacteremia; continue levofloxacin (strep in blood and sptum from
   OSH is sensitive to levoquin;)
   - Follow sputum and BAL cultures - specify modified AFB for Nocardia,
   PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Follow repeat CXR from this AM
 not significantly changed from
   prior, possibly improved aeration in LL lung
   - bronchoscopy performed with aspiration of large mucus plug; consider
   starting chest PT, mucolytics
   - No need for whole lung lavage as unclear how much PAP is playing a
   role in current presentation; unilateral disease makes it less likely;
   consider sending out GM-CSF antibodies
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to underlying sepsis/distributive shock
   given high MVO2.
   -Continue to tx underlying infection as above
   -Continue maintainence fluids
   -Has not required pressors; titrate to MAP > 60
   #Mental Status changes - [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to sepsis, however, improving
   from his infection stand point.
   - Thyroid levels checked - T3, T4 levels low.  However, in setting of
   acute illness not reliable.
   - replete lytes
   - No signs of meningismus, LP deferred
   #Anemia: Hematocrit has trended down.  Check afternoon HCT.  Likely
   secondary to fluid boluses this AM and multiple blood draws.
   -HCTs were stable over past 24 hours
   -hold on any iron studies given that this is more likely an acute
   change rather than a chronic process
   - check stool guiac
   #Pericardial effusion
 Unlikely due to volume overload given that
   there are no pleural effusions.  Could be secondary to infectious
   etiology (in setting of strep pneumonia); no signs of tamponade.
   -troponins negative, making an infectious process less likely
   # Acute renal failure:  Resolved, likely prerenal given response to
   fluids, trend Cr
   # EKG changes: Some nonspecific ST segment abnormalities on lateral
   leads. No risk factors for CAD
   -1X troponins negative; echo does not show any wall abnormalities
   -no events on telemetry
   # Hypothyroidism: IV levothyroxine - home dose
   # FEN: replete lytes, po nutrition once mental status clears

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of PAP (possibly pulmonary arterial hypertension) admitted to the ICU for S.P. pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis. The patient presented with fever, improving mental status, and an episode of chest pain that was non-cardiac in origin. The patient received nebulizers for wheezing and acetaminophen for fever. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate between 81-98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/59-154/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 2,751 mL, output of 1,570 mL, and a positive balance of 1,181 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count between 13.0-13.6 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin at 9.6 g/dL, normal glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending. Imaging shows worsened right perihilar consolidation with contralateral spreading pneumonia, stabilized right lung edema, and slightly improved left lung consolidation.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]) secondary to pneumococcal
   pneumonia, sensitive to levofloxicin. CXR today shows decreased
   consolidation on left base; more confluent in RUL.  Followup on
   remaining respiratory cultures.   Quite weak as been lying in bed; out
   of bed to chair as tolerated.  PT consult.

 HYPOTHYROIDISM:  On levothyoxine.  Check thyroid studies.
 FEVER:  Had defervesced with low grade temps, repeat temp spike
   overnight.  Send blood and urine cultures, don't change antibiotics.
   Sputum for repeat gram stain and culture if productive. If persistently
   febrile consider diagnostic thorocentesis.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Mental status continues to
   improve.

 ANEMIA:  Initial drop on this admission likely related to
   dehydration and volume resusitation.  Guaiac all stools.  Send iron
   studies.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):   Reproducible chest pain
   with palpation overnight, improved with tylenol.  No pain this
   morning.
 NUTRITION:  Clear liquid diet, advance as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and received Levofloxacin on [**2165-10-5**]. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/82 mmHg to 109/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left base with rhonchi, warm skin, and normal neurologic status. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytosis, and normal liver and kidney function. The patient's chest X-ray shows decreased consolidation on the left base but more confluent consolidation in the right upper lobe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumococcal pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is essential. Consideration for intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.

2. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. It is important to regularly check thyroid studies to ensure adequate thyroid hormone levels and to monitor for any signs of worsening hypothy"

   Aeration in the left lung has improved though large areas of

   persist throughout particularly in the lower lobe. Some of the apparent
   improvement on the left may have been due to involution of pleural
   effusion, now small to moderate. On the right, upper lobe pneumonia has
   grown more coalescent, but only a small region of consolidation is seen
   in the lower lobe. Overall the findings suggest worsening between

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAP) who was admitted with severe pneumonia (S.pneumoniae pneumosepsis). The patient's condition has shown modest improvements since admission. He is currently off the ventilator and on a high flow oxygen mask. His central line and Foley catheter have been discontinued.

The patient continues to receive medications including levoquin (sensitive to S.pneumoniae), famotidine, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and zolpidem for sleep. His allergies include a reaction to amoxicillin.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mental status changes likely secondary to the underlying septic picture. A CT head performed on [**10-4**] was negative for any acute process, and a lumbar puncture (LP) has been deferred as the patient's mental status is improving.

The patient has a pericardial effusion of unclear etiology, but with no signs of hemodynamic compromise or tamponade. His hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine, and he is receiving a regular diet with repletion of electrolytes as needed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/64 to 158/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-"
