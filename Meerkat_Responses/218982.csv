","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer, who presented to the ICU with septic shock. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple comorbidities including renal failure, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, metoprolol, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock indicates a high risk for further episodes of infection and sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity with a wound that has stopped bleeding. There is a risk of developing pressure ulcers and wound infections.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, which may indicate hepatic dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but there is still a risk of malnutrition due to prolonged"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer, who presented to the ICU with septic shock. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, and liver function abnormalities. The patient has undergone several procedures including an esophagectomy, placement of a feeding jejunostomy, and drainage of loculated effusion and pelvic abscess. He is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), tracheostomy, and has a 16Fr open feeding jejunostomy with a fistula appliance over his abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring respiratory system compliance and incentive spirometry can help reduce this risk.

2. Renal Complications: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from medications or sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and continued CVVH will be necessary to manage this complication.

3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has impaired gastrointestinal function with ongoing wound bleeding from the abdominal wound. Monitoring for signs of infection or worsening bleeding is essential. Nutritional support through"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of distal esophageal adenocarcinoma, stage T3N1, who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications.

The patient's chief complaints include dyspnea, increased oxygen requirements, and hypotension. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has been given a small bolus of fluid, which slightly decreased their pressure. The patient's respiratory rate has increased, and they remain acidemic. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) has been increased and the patient appears more comfortable. Two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) have been transfused for hypotension in discussion with the primary team.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (76-110 bpm), blood pressure of 100/51 mmHg (68-127/37-86 mmHg), respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (20-38 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 530 mL (463-530"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of distal esophageal adenocarcinoma (EUS staged T3N1). The patient has undergone a 3-hole esophagectomy and neoadjuvant chemorads. Currently, he is in the ICU with several medical complications.

The patient's chief complaint includes dyspnea, increased oxygen requirements, and hypotension. The 24-hour events indicate that the patient is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) but has decreased blood pressure, so a small bolus was given. The patient's respiratory rate increased and remains acidemic, and the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) has improved. Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was done due to hypotension.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits, but blood pressure is low. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and oxygen delivery is through a tracheostomy tube. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 530 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to spontaneous respiratory rate exceeding 35 breaths per minute.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of distal esophageal adenocarcinoma, who underwent a 3-hole esophagectomy and is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaints include dyspnea, increased oxygen requirements, and hypotension.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, atrial flutter, and liver function abnormalities. The patient also has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the esophagus.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 95/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but the albumin level is low. The cardiac markers (CK-MB and troponin-T) are negative.

The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including a tr"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of distal esophageal adenocarcinoma, who underwent a neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by an esophagectomy. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, atrial flutter, and liver function abnormalities.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and increased oxygen requirements. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set at a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's blood pressure is 95/53 mmHg, heart rate is 65 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension (not in shock), acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, liver function abnormalities, atrial flutter, and renal failure. The patient also has a history of esophageal cancer and has undergone surgical resection.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that"
