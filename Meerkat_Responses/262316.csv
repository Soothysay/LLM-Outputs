","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and diverticulitis.
- He presented to the ICU for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) evaluation of melanotic stools.
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) during the second unit due to a temperature of 101.7 degrees.
- He became confused and restless, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal or delirium tremens (DTs), and was given Valium (diazepam) at a dose of 60mg over 2 hours.
- The patient required leather restraints and continued to be restless, so Valium was decreased to 10mg Q1hr PRN.
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed pseudoaneurysm near the duodenum, which may be the source of bleeding.
- Radiology recommends embolizing the vessel before pancreatic biopsy.
- The patient's hematocrit (hct) after receiving 1.75 units of pRBCs was 31.1.
- The patient's fever continued, with a temperature of 101.8 degrees.
- He had an endoscopy at 12:00 PM on [**2111-1-10**].
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- He received infusions and other medications including diazepam (Valium) at 06"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, diverticulitis, and acute pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU for an endoscopy evaluation of melena (black, tarry stools) and fever. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to a low hemoglobin level, but developed a temperature of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit during the second unit transfusion. Tylenol and Benadryl were given, but the patient became confused and agitated, requiring Valium and restraints. His heart rate remained elevated in the 130s.

A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed pseudoaneurysm near the duodenum, which may be the source of bleeding. Radiology recommends embolizing the bleeding vessel before performing a pancreatic biopsy. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) after receiving 1.75 units of pRBCs is 31.1.

The patient has been on Valium for sedation, with the dosage decreased to 10mg every hour. He underwent an endoscopy at 12:00 PM on [date] and had a fever of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit in the evening.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He is currently receiving diazepam (Valium) and other medications as per the ICU protocol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) evaluation of melanotic stools. The patient experienced two episodes of melanotic stools and required blood transfusions. 

The patient developed a fever of 101.7 during the second unit of blood transfusion and became confused, likely experiencing withdrawal symptoms or delirium tremens (DTs). Diazepam (Valium) was administered, initially at a dose of 60mg over 2 hours and then decreased to 10mg Q1hour. The patient required leather restraints due to restlessness.

A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a pseudoaneurysm near the duodenum, which may be the source of bleeding. Radiology recommends embolizing the vessel before pancreas biopsy. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) after receiving 1.75 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) is 31.1.

During the 24-hour period, the patient had a temperature of 101.8 and received diazepam for agitation. Vital signs include a heart rate (HR) ranging from 71 to 128 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) between 74 and 91 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 12 to 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

   evidence of GIB and with unrevealing endoscopy yesterday.  He had
   evolution of increasing agitation and requirement for significant
   increase in benzo dosing to control symptoms of autonomic arousal.  The
   evolution of significnat fever noted overnight may be related to
   withdrawl syndrome but may welll be related to infection.
   1)GI Bleed-
   -HCT at 27 but patient with ongoing requirement for transfusion (2

   -Will pursue colonscopy as next evaluation
   -Prep today for colonscopy tomorrow
   -HCT q 6 hours

 FEVER-Concerning for alternative source of infection or, when
   combined with abdominal pain--possible diverticulitis.  The fever
   timing was during transfusion but inital hemolysis labs did not reveal

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and pancreatic mass. The patient had an endoscopy yesterday that did not reveal a source of bleeding. The patient has been experiencing increased agitation and fever overnight, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal or infection. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure of 97/58 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been given diazepam (Valium) to manage agitation, pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcers, and hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for pain management.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 245 K/uL, decreased hematocrit level of 27.9%, decreased platelet count of 242, and increased creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. Other lab values including blood glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, distant S2 heart sound, absent peripheral pulses, clear breath sounds with symmetric expansion and resonant percussion in the chest, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no neurological deficits assessed.

   substantially with assessment and plan as outlined above.  He is
   somewhat sleepy this morning, but arousable with no tremor. Difficult
   to assess orientation due to language barrier.   Hct continues to drift
   down suggesting ongoing oozing, but no frank blood.  With no obvious
   bleeding site on EGD plan is to do colonoscopy today although his stool
   is consistently described as melanotic.  We are transfusing with goal
   of maintaining hct > 25.  Withdrawal relatively controlled with
   diazepam.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, diverticulitis, presenting to the ICU for an EGD evaluation of melanotic stools. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that can arise:

1. GI Bleeding: The patient presents with melanotic stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite an EGD procedure showing no bleeding site, multiple potential causes including small bowel or colonic bleeding are still possible. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is trending down, suggesting ongoing blood loss. Serial hematocrits will be monitored, and blood transfusions will be given to maintain Hct above 26. A colonoscopy is recommended to identify the source of bleeding.

2. Pancreatitis/Pancreatic mass: The patient has a confirmed cystic mass at the head of the pancreas, and pancreatitis is suspected. The patient will continue to be treated with IV fluids and pain medications as needed. An ERCP is scheduled for Tuesday to obtain an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass.

3. Alcohol abuse: The patient continues to have symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, for which he received valium yesterday. CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure Prophylaxis) will be continued with valium as needed. Thiamine and folate supplementation will also be provided to address nutritional deficiencies associated with alcohol abuse.

4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, diverticulitis, and presenting symptoms of melanotic stools. He has been admitted to the ICU for an EGD evaluation. 

From the note, it can be determined that the patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of melanotic stools. An EGD procedure was performed, but no active bleeding site was found. The cause of the bleeding remains undetermined, with potential sources including small bowel or colonic bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels are continuing to trend down slowly, indicating ongoing blood loss. Serial hematocrits will be monitored, and the patient will be transfused if the hemoglobin level falls below 26. A type and screen blood test has been ordered for cross-matching purposes. 

The patient also has pancreatitis and a cystic mass at the head of the pancreas, confirmed by a CT scan. Treatment for pancreatitis includes NPO (nothing by mouth), pain management with Dilaudid as needed, and an ERCP scheduled for Tuesday to obtain an ultrasound-guided biopsy. 

The patient is also dealing with alcohol abuse and is experiencing symptoms consistent with withdrawal. He has been given Valium at a dose of 50mg yesterday, and CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) will be used to monitor his withdrawal symptoms. Thiamine and folate supplementation have been initiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting to the ICU for an evaluation of melanotic stools. The patient has been experiencing ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin, acute pancreatitis, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss. The patient has been treated with packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is scheduled for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) tomorrow to investigate and potentially perform a biopsy of a cystic mass at the head of the pancreas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's melanotic stools suggest ongoing bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to significant blood loss and potentially result in hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can progress to pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation. These complications can lead to sepsis, multiorgan failure, and increased mortality.
3. Pancreatic mass: The presence of a cystic mass at the head of the pancreas raises concerns for malignancy. Biopsy and histopathological examination are necessary to determine the nature of the mass. If it is indeed malignant, the patient may require further surgical intervention and treatment.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts him at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting to the ICU for an EGD evaluation of melanotic stools. The patient has experienced multiple episodes of melena, with the most recent one occurring on 1/14 at 11 AM. His hematocrit (Hct) has been trending down, indicating ongoing blood loss. Despite receiving 2 units of blood, his Hct continues to decrease. The source of bleeding remains unidentified through EGD, suggesting a possible small bowel or colonic bleeding. The plan is to proceed with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and colonoscopy today to further investigate the cause of bleeding.

Additionally, the patient has a history of pancreatitis and a confirmed cystic mass at the head of the pancreas on CT scan. He is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), and his pain medication will be managed as needed. An ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is scheduled for an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass.

The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse, previously experiencing delirium tremens. He is being treated with CIWA (alcohol withdrawal scale) and valium PRN (as needed) for withdrawal symptoms, along with thiamine and folate supplementation.

Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient"

   Critical Care
   Present for key portions of resident
s history and exam. Agree
   substantially with assessment and plan.  He continues to bleed with
   some BRB evident in stool over night after prep.  Hct continues to
   slowly decline. Has now received 7 U PRBC but remains hemodyn stable.
   Alert, comfortable on exam w/o abd tenderness or evidence of
   withdrawal.
   Continued bleeding, almost certainly from colonic source.  Oozing seems
   somewhat atypical for diverticular source and an AVM seems more likely.
   In any case needs complete evaluation. If not amenable to colonoscopic
   intervention may welll need surgery.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents to the ICU for an evaluation of melanotic stools. He has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of melena and a decreasing hematocrit level. Despite receiving 7 units of blood transfusion, the patient remains hemodynamically stable.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal kidney function. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but his INR is slightly elevated at 1.1.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has multiple potential causes for his bleeding, including small bowel or colonic bleeding. Endoscopic evaluation (EGD) did not reveal any site of bleeding, so further investigations are needed. The plan includes endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and colonoscopy to identify the source of bleeding.

In terms of medical complications, the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding poses a significant risk. The ongoing blood loss can lead to hypovolemia and shock if not promptly managed. The need for repeated blood transfusions also increases the risk of transfusion-related complications.

Additionally, the patient's history of alcohol abuse and previous delirium tremens suggest the possibility of withdrawal symptoms. The use of CIWA with valium PRN is appropriate to manage any alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and prompt intervention to address the ongoing bleeding and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, diverticulitis, presenting to the ICU for EGD evaluation of melanotic stools. The patient has been experiencing melena (black, tarry stools), which indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite undergoing an EGD, no site of bleeding was identified, suggesting potential bleeding from the small bowel or colon. The patient's hematocrit levels have been trending down, indicating ongoing blood loss. Serial hematocrit checks will be performed, and the patient will be transfused if the level falls below 26. 

The patient also has a confirmed cystic mass at the head of the pancreas, consistent with acute pancreatitis. He will be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) and treated with pain medications as needed. An ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) has been scheduled for Tuesday to perform an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and previous delirium tremens. He will continue to receive CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) with valium as needed, along with thiamine and folate supplementation.

The patient is receiving IV fluids (IVF) and will have his electrolytes repleted. Subcutaneous heparin is being administered as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's peripheral lines have been"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse and diverticulitis. He is currently in the ICU for an evaluation of melanotic stools, which suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has received a total of 7 units of blood during his hospital stay. Endoscopy (EGD) performed on [**1-10**] did not reveal a site of bleeding, and colonoscopy on [**1-14**] showed only hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, with no active bleeding observed. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Re-bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding has not been completely resolved, as indicated by the presence of melanotic stools and the need for ongoing monitoring and transfusions. There is a risk of re-bleeding, which could require additional interventions such as another EGD or surgery.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has a cystic mass at the head of the pancreas, which could be a source of bleeding. This finding suggests a potential risk of pancreatitis or worsening pancreatic condition.

3. Infection: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and previous episode of delirium tremens, there is a possibility of an increased risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate management will be necessary.

4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis against deep"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and diverticulitis who presented to the ICU for an evaluation of melanotic stools. He has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, with a total of 7 units of blood transfused during his hospital course. Endoscopy (EGD) on 1/10 did not reveal any bleeding site, and colonoscopy on 1/14 only showed hemorrhoids and diverticulitis but no active bleeding. Potential causes of bleeding include small bowel or colonic bleeding. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is now stable.

Plan:
- If bleeding redevelops and is more rapid, consider tagged RBC scan, also will contact surgery.
- Consider EGD after ERCP if no source of bleeding still present.
- Will check serial hematocrits.
