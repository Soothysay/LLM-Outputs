   Microbiology: Urine and blood cultures pending
   UA negative
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man presenting with hypotension and septic shock.
   # Shock, likely septic:  Elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension
   requiring pressors, and evidence of end organ damage meet criteria for
   severe sepsis.  Volume replete based on PA diastolic pressior of in low
   20s and CVP of 14.  Source is unclear but may include lungs (given
   recent cough, for which he was started on levoquin), abdomen (h/o C.
   diff, c/o abdominal pain).  Cardiac and hypovolemic shock not c/w
   clinical picture.  Neuro/endocrine unlikely.
   - Maintain CV O2 sat > 80 with transfusion
   - CVP monitoring with central line, CVP goal [**11-17**]
   - Arterial line; Continue levophed drip, titrate to MAP > 65, use
   Vasopressin if second [**Doctor Last Name **] needed
   - Broad spectrum ABX targeting abdomen: IV Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.  PO Vanco
      - Vanc trough sufficient with morning labs.  Repeat dose and recheck
   tomorrow.
   - CT C/A/P with PO but not IV contrast to eval for source, r/o
   drainable collection
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - Contact PCP for culture data, h/o VRE, MRSA
   - Check cortisol to r/o adrenal insufficency
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation
   would also be consistent with pericarditis.  Patient may have output
   capacity in the setting of infection limited by restrictive heart
   disease.
   - Continue Statin, ASA 81 mg
   - Echocardiogram to r/o restrictive heart disease
   # COPD: COPD is rare in patients without a smoking history.  Would
   consider bronchiectasis, restrictive lung disease.
   - Will eval by CT thorax
   - Contact PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 414**]
   # Renal failure:  Unclear baseline Cr, but high suspicion for acute
   renal failure given current infection
   - NAC and bicarb for post-contrast nephropathy
   - Renal dose meds
   - Avoid renal toxic meds
   - Follow Cr
   - Consider renal u/s and sediment if not clearing
   # S/P Cath: Back pain appears chronic but in setting of recent cath
   would be concerning for RP hematoma.
   - Will eval during Abd CT
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man admitted to the ICU with hypotension and septic shock. He has an elevated WBC count, tachycardia, and evidence of end-organ damage, which meet the criteria for severe sepsis. The source of infection is unclear but may involve the lungs or abdomen. He requires pressors for blood pressure support and has a central line in place. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting the abdomen, as well as vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending. The patient also has elevated ST segments on ECG, consistent with myocardial ischemia or pericarditis, and may have limited cardiac output due to restrictive heart disease. He has a history of COPD, renal failure, back pain, Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He is currently on multiple medications including antihypertensives, which are held in the setting of septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued septic shock and its associated complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Myocardial ischemia or infarction due to the elevated ST segments on ECG.
3. Respiratory failure due to underlying COPD or complications from the infection.
4. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal failure.
5. Clostridium difficile colitis exacerb"

   UA negative
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man presenting with hypotension and septic shock.
   # Shock, likely septic:  Elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension
   requiring pressors, and evidence of end organ damage meet criteria for
   severe sepsis.  On arrival to MICU was volume replete based on PA
   diastolic pressior of in low 20s and CVP of 14.  However CVP has
   trended down overnight.  Source remains is unclear but may include
   lungs (given recent cough, and retrocardiac lesion), abdomen (C. diff
   positive, c/o abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal distension on CT).
   Cardiac and hypovolemic shock not c/w clinical picture.  Blood loss
   from procedures may have contributed somewhat.  Neuro/endocrine
   unlikely, cortisol appropriately high.
   - Broad spectrum ABX targeting abdomen: IV Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.  PO Vanco
      - Vanc trough sufficient with morning labs.  Repeat dose today and
   recheck tomorrow.
      - PO Vanc limited by NPO.  Will advance today.  Takes meds crushed
   in applesauce at home.
      - Atypicals unlikely given legionella negative and recent Levoquin
   use.
   - Probiotics
   - Further C. diff management per GI given several week history of
   poorly treated C. diff
   - NG tube placement with sedation with GI guidance, given recent
   bleeding.
   - Maintain CV O2 sat > 80 with transfusion
   - CVP monitoring with central line, CVP goal 15 (increased given
   possible diastolic dysfunction), 500 cc NS bolus as needed.
   - Continue levophed drip, titrate to MAP > 65, use Vasopressin if
   second [**Doctor Last Name **] needed
   - F/U final CT read
   - Follow sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - Contact PCP for culture data, h/o VRE, MRSA
   # Bleeding:  Likely secondary to anticoagulation including plavix for
   MI workup.
   - Pressure to hold IJ site

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man admitted to the ICU with hypotension and septic shock. He has a history of multiple comorbidities including Parkinson's disease, hypertension, and possible myocardial ischemia. The patient has been experiencing symptoms such as cough, fever, and abdominal pain. He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and has not responded to previous treatments. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and he requires pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate levels, indicating ongoing infection and sepsis. The patient's imaging studies reveal mild aortic regurgitation, pericardial effusion, and atelectasis. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting the abdomen and lungs. The patient's bleeding from the insertion site of a central line and elevated INR requires management. There are multiple potential medical complications that can arise, including further deterioration of renal function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, worsening of sepsis, and potential bleeding events due to the use of anticoagulants."

   The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
   No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
   mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   CHEST/ABD/PELVIS CT:  Atelectasis at lung bases.  Thickening of sigmoid
   and rectum c/w colitis.  Cystic lesion near duodenum of low concern.
   CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
   1. Coronary arteries are without angiographically apparent disease.
   2. Normal left sided filling pressure.
   3. Mildly elevated right atrial pressure.
   4. Systemic hypotension.
   5. Preserved cardiac index (while receiving levophed IV).

   Legionella negative
   C. diff positive
   UA negative
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man presenting with hypotension and septic shock.
   # Shock, likely septic:  Elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension
   requiring pressors, and evidence of end organ damage meet criteria for
   severe sepsis.  On arrival to MICU was volume replete based on PA
   diastolic pressior of in low 20s and CVP of 14.  However CVP has
   trended down overnight.  Source remains is unclear but may include
   lungs (given recent cough, and retrocardiac lesion), abdomen (C. diff
   positive, c/o abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal distension on CT).
   Cardiac and hypovolemic shock not c/w clinical picture.  Blood loss
   from procedures may have contributed somewhat.  Neuro/endocrine
   unlikely, cortisol appropriately high.
   - Broad spectrum ABX targeting abdomen: IV Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.  PO Vanco
      - Vanc trough sufficient with morning labs.  Repeat dose today and
   recheck tomorrow.
      - PO Vanc limited by NPO.  Will advance today.  Takes meds crushed
   in applesauce at home.
      - Atypicals unlikely given legionella negative and recent Levoquin
   use.
   - Probiotics
   - Further C. diff management per GI given several week history of
   poorly treated C. diff
   - NG tube placement with sedation with GI guidance, given recent
   bleeding.
   - Maintain CV O2 sat > 80 with transfusion
   - CVP monitoring with central line, CVP goal 15 (increased given
   possible diastolic dysfunction), 500 cc NS bolus as needed.
   - Continue levophed drip, titrate to MAP > 65, use Vasopressin if
   second [**Doctor Last Name **] needed
   - F/U final CT read
   - Follow sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - Contact PCP for culture data, h/o VRE, MRSA
   # Bleeding:  Likely secondary to anticoagulation including plavix for
   MI workup.
   - Pressure to hold IJ site
   - Obtain blood consent
   - TID Hct, transfuse for HCT < 29 (5 point drop)
   - Hold anticoagulants except SQH
   - Vitamin K given elevated INR and antibiotic use.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of hypotension, septic shock, and multiple medical conditions. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has several ongoing issues that require attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's presentation with hypotension, tachycardia, elevated WBC count, and evidence of end organ damage suggests severe sepsis. This condition can lead to further deterioration in organ function and potentially result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

2. Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding episodes, likely secondary to anticoagulation therapy. This increases the risk of hemorrhage and requires close monitoring and management.

3. Myocardial ischemia: Elevated ST segments seen on the electrocardiogram (EKG) suggest myocardial ischemia. This could indicate an acute coronary syndrome, especially considering the clean coronaries found during cardiac catheterization. Appropriate cardiac support and management are necessary.

4. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level indicates chronic kidney disease, but there is a high suspicion for acute renal failure due to the ongoing infection. Renal dose medications and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents should be considered.

5. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a sacral decubitus, which requires wound care management to prevent further complications such as infection.

6. Back pain: Chronic spinal stenosis"

   Imaging: ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
   LVEF > 55%, Mild AR, MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 667**] effusion, mild LVH
   The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
   No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
   mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   CHEST/ABD/PELVIS CT:  Atelectasis at lung bases.  Thickening of sigmoid
   and rectum c/w colitis.  Cystic lesion near duodenum of low concern.
   CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
   1. Coronary arteries are without angiographically apparent disease.
   2. Normal left sided filling pressure.
   3. Mildly elevated right atrial pressure.
   4. Systemic hypotension.
   5. Preserved cardiac index (while receiving levophed IV).
   Microbiology: Urine and blood cultures pending
   UA negative
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man presenting with hypotension and septic shock.
   # Shock, likely septic:  Elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension
   requiring pressors, and evidence of end organ damage meet criteria for
   severe sepsis.  On arrival to MICU was volume replete based on PA
   diastolic pressior of in low 20s and CVP of 14.  However CVP has
   trended down overnight.  Source remains is unclear but may include
   lungs (given recent cough, and retrocardiac lesion), abdomen (C. diff
   positive, c/o abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal distension on CT).
   Cardiac and hypovolemic shock not c/w clinical picture.  Blood loss
   from procedures may have contributed somewhat.  Neuro/endocrine
   unlikely, cortisol appropriately high.
   - Broad spectrum ABX targeting abdomen: IV Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.  PO Vanco
      - Vanc trough sufficient with morning labs.  Repeat dose today and
   recheck tomorrow.
      - PO Vanc limited by NPO.  Will advance today.  Takes meds crushed
   in applesauce at home.
   - Probiotics
   - Maintain CV O2 sat > 80 with transfusion
   - CVP monitoring with central line, CVP goal [**11-17**], 500 cc NS bolus as
   needed.
   - Continue levophed drip, titrate to MAP > 65, use Vasopressin if
   second [**Doctor Last Name **] needed
   - F/U final CT read
   - Follow sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - Contact PCP for culture data, h/o VRE, MRSA
   # Bleeding:  Likely secondary to anticoagulation including plavix for
   MI workup.
   - Pressure to hold IJ site
   - Obtain blood consent
   - TID Hct, transfuse for HCT < 29 (5 point drop)
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation
   would also be consistent with pericarditis.  Echocardiogram showed no
   evidence of restrictive heart disease.  Troponins are reassuring.
   - Continue Statin, ASA 81 mg
   # COPD: COPD is rare in patients without a smoking history.  Would
   consider bronchiectasis, restrictive lung disease.
   - F/U CT throax
   - Contact PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 414**]
   # Renal failure:  Somewhat improved today.  Baseline Cr, but high
   suspicion for acute renal failure given current infection
   - Renal dose meds, avoid renal toxic meds
   - Obtain baseline Cr from PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Follow Cr
   - Consider renal u/s and sediment if not clearing
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
   - Wound care c/s
   # Back pain - likely chronic spinal stenosis.

","The patient is a 76-year-old man who presented with hypotension and septic shock. He has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggests septic shock. The source of infection is unclear but may involve the lungs, abdomen, or both.

2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Given the current infection, acute renal failure is a concern.

3. Myocardial ischemia: Elevated ST segments are present in the setting of clean coronaries, suggesting demand ischemia or pericarditis. Troponin levels are reassuring, indicating no significant myocardial damage.

4. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy. Measures should be taken to control any bleeding episodes, such as applying pressure to hold the internal jugular (IJ) site and obtaining blood consent.

5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and renal dose medications should be administered while avoiding renal toxic drugs.

6. COPD: Although rare in non-smokers, the patient's symptoms could indicate bronchiectasis or restrictive lung disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o man with
          Shock
   o         Likely a mixed picture.  Appears somewhat hypovolemic, but
   likely septic.  Cardiac disease (particularly pericardial) is not
   excluded.
   o         Sources include C diff and pneumonia.  Decub less likely.
   Doubt atypical pneumonia given that he was on levoflox until a couple
   of days ago and that Legionella Ag is negative.  Antibiotic therapy:
          Oral vanco
          IV Flagyl
          Zosyn
   o         Discuss with cardiology (no RV pressure recorded)
   o         Goal-directed therapy, aiming for CVP a bit higher then 12
   o         Adrenal insufficiency adequately excluded
   o         Does not meet criteria for drotrecogin
   o         Other issues as per ICU team note
          C diff
   o         Vanco oral; Flagyl IV
   o         Re-attempt NG decompression
   o         Consult GI for assistance with complicated C diff management
   (?supplementary therapies)
          Repeat lactate
 if elevated consult surgery.
          ST elevations
   o         Do not appear ischemic.  Will discuss further with
   cardiology.
   Contact PCP for old records.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man admitted to the MICU with hypotension and ST elevations. He has a history of allergies to various medications and is unable to provide his own medical history due to encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/62 mmHg to 95/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on multiple medications including norepinephrine, heparin, sinemet, statin, Flagyl, ASA, Zosyn, PPI, levophed, and others. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. He also has elevated levels of AST, ALT, amylase, lipase, and LDH. The patient tested positive for C. difficile but negative for Legionella. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with shock, likely a mixed picture of hypovolemic and septic shock. The sources of infection include C. difficile and pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated with oral vancomycin, IV Flagyl, and Zosyn. The patient's cardiac status needs further evaluation, and goal-directed therapy is planned to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) above 12. Adrenal insufficiency has been ruled out, and the patient does not meet criteria for drotrecogin. Additional issues such as Parkinson's disease, decubitus ulcer, and line site bleeding are mentioned but not fully addressed in the note. The ICU team will continue to monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man presenting with hypotension and septic shock.
   # Shock, likely septic:  Elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension
   requiring pressors, and evidence of end organ damage meet criteria for
   severe sepsis.  On arrival to MICU was volume replete based on PA
   diastolic pressior of in low 20s and CVP of 14.  However CVP trended
   down overnight.  Source is likely colitis, but may include lungs (given
   recent cough, and retrocardiac lesion on CT), abdomen (C. diff
   positive, c/o abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal distension on CT).
   Cardiac and hypovolemic shock not c/w clinical picture.  Blood loss
   from procedures may have contributed somewhat.  Neuro/endocrine
   unlikely, cortisol appropriately high.
   - Initial broad spectrum ABX targeting abdomen: IV Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.
   PO Vanc
   - Vanc trough sufficient with morning labs.  Repeat dose today and
   recheck tomorrow.
   - PO Vanc limited by NPO.  Will advance today.  Takes meds crushed in
   applesauce at home.
   - Atypicals unlikely given legionella negative and recent Levoquin use.
   - Probiotics may be appropriate when no longer on Abx
   - Further C. diff management per GI given several week history of
   poorly treated C. diff
   - NG tube placement with sedation with GI guidance, given recent
   bleeding.
   - Maintain CV O2 sat > 80 with transfusion
   - CVP monitoring with central line, CVP goal initially 15 (increased
   given possible diastolic dysfunction), 500 cc NS bolus as needed.
   - Had levophed drip, titrated to MAP > 65, would use Vasopressin if
   second [**Doctor Last Name **] needed
   - Final CT read as above.
   - Following sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - Contact PCP for culture data, h/o VRE, MRSA
   - Pt improving clinically with IVF, still appearing clinically dry and
   continues to have good/baseline respiratory status.
   - Continue 500cc NS fluid bolus, titrate to CVP 6-7, MAP > 65-70.
   - GI recs: surgery consult ? toxic megacolon, continue
   Vanc/Flagyl/Zosyn, No intraluminal vanco, no IVIG, hold laxatives, hold
   narcotics.
   # Bleeding:  Likely secondary to anticoagulation including plavix for
   MI workup.
   - Pressure to hold IJ site
   - Obtain blood consent
   - TID Hct, transfuse for HCT < 29 (5 point drop)
   - Hold anticoagulants except SQH
   - Vitamin K given elevated INR and antibiotic use.
   - Bleeding from right IJ site resolved
   - Transfused 1unit PRBCs with HCT rise from 30.9 to 34.2
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation
   would also be consistent with pericarditis.  Echocardiogram showed no
   evidence of restrictive heart disease.  Troponins are reassuring.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   # COPD: COPD is rare in patients without a smoking history.  Would
   consider bronchiectasis, restrictive lung disease.
   - F/U CT throax
   - Contact PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 414**].
   - PCP reports no hx of COPD
   # Renal failure:  Improved today from Cr 1.5 to 1.2.  Per PCP baseline
   Cr is 1.1. Likely [**3-9**] to dehydration/prerenal.
   - Renal dose meds, avoid renal toxic meds while Cr elevated
   - Continue to follow Cr
   - Consider renal u/s and sediment if not clearing
   - Continue IV hydration
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub

   # Back pain - likely chronic spinal stenosis.
   - pt without complaints while here
   - written for Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain, but should avoid
   narcotics unless necessary.
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.  Add
   back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10 mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: replete lytes prn.  Colase/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now
   with colitis and diarrhea.
   - Speech and swallow c/s, careful diet as advancement (thickened
   liquids and observation).
   - NPO except meds for now
   # Endo: QID finger sticks, Insulin sliding scale
   # PPx: subq heparin, home dose of Protonix 40 mg QD for stress ulcer

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male presenting with hypotension and septic shock. The patient has been in the ICU since admission and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of multiple comorbidities including Parkinson's disease, hypertension, COPD, and renal failure. The patient's initial vital signs were unstable with a blood pressure in the 90s despite receiving several 500cc boluses throughout the day. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending downward, from 36.7 on admission to 30.9, indicating significant blood loss. The patient's C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are elevated, suggesting an ongoing inflammatory response.

The patient's blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods consistent with a bacterial infection. He has been empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting the abdomen, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. Probiotics may be considered once the patient is no longer on antibiotics.

The patient's chest X-ray shows clear lung fields with a hiatal hernia and the NG tube coiled in the stomach. A CT scan of the chest/abdomen reveals a distended sigmoid colon, edema of the rectal wall, and a moderate pericardial effusion. There is also evidence of axial hiatal hernia and left lower lobe consolidation, which could be indicative of pneumonia. The patient's cardiac enzymes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man presenting with hypotension and septic shock. He has elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension requiring pressors, and evidence of end-organ damage, which meet criteria for severe sepsis. The source of infection is unclear but may include the lungs and abdomen. Blood loss from procedures may have contributed. Neuro/endocrine shock is unlikely. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started targeting the abdomen, and probiotics have also been given. The patient's CVP has trended down overnight. Other medical issues include bleeding secondary to anticoagulation, myocardial ischemia, COPD, renal failure, Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, back pain, hypertension, and endocrine disorders.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to further hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Bleeding: Due to anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of bleeding, particularly at the IJ site and from other sites. Transfusion may be necessary if the Hct level drops below 29.
3. Myocardial ischemia: Elevated ST segments indicate demand ischemia or pericarditis. Continued cardiac monitoring and evaluation are required.
4. COPD exacerbation: While COPD is rare without a smoking history, the patient may still experience exacerbations that"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man presenting with hypotension and septic shock.
   # Shock, likely septic:  Elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension
   requiring pressors, and evidence of end organ damage meet criteria for
   severe sepsis.  On arrival to MICU was volume replete based on PA
   diastolic pressior of in low 20s and CVP of 14.  However CVP has
   trended down overnight.  Source remains is unclear but may include
   lungs (given recent cough, and retrocardiac lesion), abdomen (C. diff
   positive, c/o abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal distension on CT).
   Cardiac and hypovolemic shock not c/w clinical picture.  Blood loss
   from procedures may have contributed somewhat.  Neuro/endocrine
   unlikely, cortisol appropriately high.
   - Broad spectrum ABX targeting abdomen: IV Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.  PO Vanc
   - Vanc trough sufficient with morning labs.  Repeat dose today and
   recheck tomorrow.
   - PO Vanc limited by NPO.  Will advance today.  Takes meds crushed in
   applesauce at home.
    - Atypicals unlikely given legionella negative and recent Levoquin
   use.
   - Probiotics
   - Further C. diff management per GI given several week history of
   poorly treated C. diff
   - NG tube placement with sedation with GI guidance, given recent
   bleeding.
   - Maintain CV O2 sat > 80 with transfusion
   - CVP monitoring with central line, CVP goal 15 (increased given
   possible diastolic dysfunction), 500 cc NS bolus as needed.
   - Continue levophed drip, titrate to MAP > 65, use Vasopressin if
   second [**Doctor Last Name **] needed
   - F/U final CT read
   - Follow sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - Contact PCP for culture data, h/o VRE, MRSA
   # Bleeding:  Likely secondary to anticoagulation including plavix for
   MI workup.
   - Pressure to hold IJ site
   - Obtain blood consent
   - TID Hct, transfuse for HCT < 29 (5 point drop)
   - Hold anticoagulants except SQH
   - Vitamin K given elevated INR and antibiotic use.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation
   would also be consistent with pericarditis.  Echocardiogram showed no
   evidence of restrictive heart disease.  Troponins are reassuring.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   # COPD: COPD is rare in patients without a smoking history.  Would
   consider bronchiectasis, restrictive lung disease.
   - F/U CT throax
   - Contact PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 414**]
   # Renal failure:  Somewhat improved today.  Baseline Cr, but high
   suspicion for acute renal failure given current infection
   - Renal dose meds, avoid renal toxic meds
   - Obtain baseline Cr from PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Follow Cr
   - Consider renal u/s and sediment if not clearing
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
   -          Wound care c/s
   # Back pain - likely chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.  Add
   back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10 mg QD
   # FEN/GI: replete lytes prn.  Colase/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN.
   - Speech and swallow c/s, diet as tolerated (thickened liquids and
   observation).
   - NPO except meds for now
   # Endo: QID finger sticks, Insulin sliding scale
   # PPx: subq heparin, home dose of Protonix 40 mg QD for stress ulcer
   # Access: PIV
   # Code: DNR/DNI but could reverse if intubation likely to be temporary

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with hypotension and septic shock. He has a history of several medical conditions including COPD, C. difficile infection, renal failure, Parkinson's disease, hypertension, and a possible hiatal hernia. The patient's current vital signs show a low blood pressure, increased heart rate, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation above 98%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula. 

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting the abdomen, probiotics, and sedation for NG tube placement. He is also being given pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure above 65. 

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. These include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has been bleeding secondary to anticoagulation including Plavix for an MI workup. Measures such as applying pressure to the internal jugular (IJ) site, obtaining blood consent, and holding anticoagulants except for subcutaneous heparin should be taken to manage this complication.

2. Myocardial ischemia: The patient has elevated ST segments in the setting of clean coronaries per cath report, which may indicate demand ischemia or pericarditis. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease, and troponins are reassuring. The patient should continue taking a statin at 40 mg and hold ASA 81 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man presenting with hypotension and septic shock.
   # Shock, likely septic:  Elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension
   requiring pressors, and evidence of end organ damage meet criteria for
   severe sepsis.  On arrival to MICU was volume replete based on PA
   diastolic pressior of in low 20s and CVP of 14.  However CVP trended
   down overnight.  Source is likely colitis, but may include lungs (given
   recent cough, and retrocardiac lesion on CT), abdomen (C. diff
   positive, c/o abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal distension on CT).
   Cardiac and hypovolemic shock not c/w clinical picture.  Blood loss
   from procedures may have contributed somewhat.  Neuro/endocrine
   unlikely, cortisol appropriately high.
   - Initial broad spectrum ABX targeting abdomen: IV Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.
   PO Vanc
   - Vanc trough sufficient with morning labs.  Repeat dose today and
   recheck tomorrow.
   - PO Vanc limited by NPO.  Will advance today.  Takes meds crushed in
   applesauce at home.
   - Atypicals unlikely given legionella negative and recent Levoquin use.
   - Probiotics may be appropriate when no longer on Abx
   - Further C. diff management per GI given several week history of
   poorly treated C. diff
   - NG tube placement with sedation with GI guidance, given recent
   bleeding.
   - Maintain CV O2 sat > 80 with transfusion
   - CVP monitoring with central line, CVP goal initially 15 (increased
   given possible diastolic dysfunction), 500 cc NS bolus as needed.
   - Had levophed drip, titrated to MAP > 65, would use Vasopressin if
   second [**Doctor Last Name **] needed
   - Final CT read as above.
   - Following sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - Contact PCP for culture data, h/o VRE, MRSA
   - Pt improving clinically with IVF, still appearing clinically dry and
   continues to have good/baseline respiratory status.
   - Continue 500cc NS fluid bolus, titrate to CVP 6-7, MAP > 65-70.
   - GI recs: surgery consult ? toxic megacolon, continue
   Vanc/Flagyl/Zosyn, No intraluminal vanco, no IVIG, hold laxatives, hold
   narcotics.
   # Bleeding:  Likely secondary to anticoagulation including plavix for
   MI workup.
   - Pressure to hold IJ site
   - Obtain blood consent
   - TID Hct, transfuse for HCT < 29 (5 point drop)
   - Hold anticoagulants except SQH
   - Vitamin K given elevated INR and antibiotic use.
   - Bleeding from right IJ site resolved
   - Transfused 1unit PRBCs with HCT rise from 30.9 to 34.2
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation
   would also be consistent with pericarditis.  Echocardiogram showed no
   evidence of restrictive heart disease.  Troponins are reassuring.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   # COPD: COPD is rare in patients without a smoking history.  Would
   consider bronchiectasis, restrictive lung disease.
   - F/U CT throax
   - Contact PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 414**].
   - PCP reports no hx of COPD
   # Renal failure:  Improved today from Cr 1.5 to 1.2.  Per PCP baseline
   Cr is 1.1. Likely [**3-9**] to dehydration/prerenal.
   - Renal dose meds, avoid renal toxic meds while Cr elevated
   - Continue to follow Cr
   - Consider renal u/s and sediment if not clearing
   - Continue IV hydration
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
   -          Wound care c/s
   # Back pain - likely chronic spinal stenosis.
   - pt without complaints while here
   - written for Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain, but should avoid
   narcotics unless necessary.
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.  Add
   back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10 mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: replete lytes prn.  Colase/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now
   with colitis and diarrhea.
   - Speech and swallow c/s, careful diet as advancement (thickened
   liquids and observation).
   - NPO except meds for now
   # Endo: QID finger sticks, Insulin sliding scale
   # PPx: subq heparin, home dose of Protonix 40 mg QD for stress ulcer
   # Access: PIV x 2, L art line, R-IJ.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man who presented with hypotension and septic shock. He has a history of multiple comorbidities, including COPD, hypertension, and Parkinson's disease. The patient's condition has been complex and has required close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's initial presentation with hypotension and tachycardia suggests septic shock. This condition requires immediate attention and aggressive treatment to maintain organ perfusion and prevent further complications.

2. Sepsis Source: The source of sepsis is likely colitis, but there may be involvement of the lungs and abdomen as well. The patient's symptoms, including cough and retrocardiac lesion on CT, along with positive C. diff and abdominal pain, point towards these possibilities. Identifying the exact source will guide targeted antibiotic therapy.

3. Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding from the right internal jugular vein site, likely due to anticoagulation. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and timely intervention with blood products are necessary to manage this complication.

4. Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments were observed, suggesting myocardial ischemia. However, clean coronaries per cath report and reassuring troponin levels indicate that this could be related to demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome. Ongoing cardiac monitoring is essential.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved"

   1. Bilateral pulmonary consolidations, left more than right, could
   reflect aspiration pneumonia in the setting of hiatal hernia. There is
   also an abnormal appearance to the hypopharynx, which is gas-distended
   with apparent external laryngoceles, which may relate to aspiration
   risk.
   2. Massively distended sigmoid colon measuring up to 10.3 cm. There is
   a transition point at the rectosigmoid junction with fullness in the
   rectum and associated mural edema. Overall, these findings reflect
   potential rectosigmoid obstruction possibly from volvulus, occult mass
   or stricture. Within limitations on non-contrast evaluation, no
   associated secondary signs of
   inflammation or ischemia were noted.
   3. Cystic structure adjacent to the proximal third part of duodenum as
   described above may represent a duodenal duplication cyst/fluid-filled
   duodenal diverticulum. Other differential considerations include cystic
   neoplasm or, less likely, aneurysm, overall incompletely evaluated in
   the non- contrast setting.

   1. Bilateral pulmonary consolidations, left more than right, could
   reflect aspiration pneumonia in the setting of hiatal hernia. There is
   also an abnormal appearance to the hypopharynx, which is gas-distended
   with apparent external laryngoceles, which may relate to aspiration
   risk.
   2. Massively distended sigmoid colon measuring up to 10.3 cm. There is
   a transition point at the rectosigmoid junction with fullness in the
   rectum and associated mural edema. Overall, these findings reflect
   potential rectosigmoid obstruction possibly from volvulus, occult mass
   or stricture. Within limitations on non-contrast evaluation, no
   associated secondary signs of
   inflammation or ischemia were noted.
   3. Cystic structure adjacent to the proximal third part of duodenum as
   described above may represent a duodenal duplication cyst/fluid-filled
   duodenal diverticulum. Other differential considerations include cystic
   neoplasm or, less likely, aneurysm, overall incompletely evaluated in
   the non- contrast setting.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man presenting with hypotension and septic shock.
   # Septic shock related to C. diff colitis.  Pressured improved and
   stable off levophed.  Symptoms are resolving.
   - PO Vanc/IV flagyl
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - Probiotics may be appropriate when no longer on Abx
   - IVF with CVP goal > 8
   - CVP goal > 8
   - Follow cultures
   - NG tube for decompression
   - KUB today
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat.
   - Rate control with diltiazam and digitalis
   - consider amiodorone if needed
   # Bleeding:  Hct stable to trending up.  Got Vit K.
   - Hold anticoagulants except SQH.
   - Bleeding from right IJ site resolved
   - Transfusion if needed
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation
   would also be consistent with pericarditis.  Echocardiogram showed no
   evidence of restrictive heart disease.  Troponins are reassuring.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   # COPD: COPD is rare in patients without a smoking history.  Would
   consider bronchiectasis, restrictive lung disease.
   - F/U CT throax
   - Contact PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 414**].
   - PCP reports no hx of COPD
   # Renal failure:  Improved today from Cr 1.5 to 1.2.  Per PCP baseline
   Cr is 1.1. Likely [**3-9**] to dehydration/prerenal.
   - Renal dose meds, avoid renal toxic meds while Cr elevated
   - Continue to follow Cr
   - Consider renal u/s and sediment if not clearing
   - Continue IV hydration
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub

","The patient is a 76-year-old man who presented with hypotension and septic shock, which was later identified as related to Clostridium difficile colitis. The patient's symptoms have improved, and he is now stable off levophed. He is currently being treated with PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, for which he is being treated with diltiazem and digitalis. The ECG is flat, indicating no pre-excitation syndrome.

There is a concern for bleeding, as the patient's HCT is stable and trending up. He has received vitamin K, and anticoagulants have been held except for subcutaneous heparin. The bleeding from the right internal jugular site has resolved, and the patient may require a blood transfusion if necessary.

The patient has evidence of myocardial ischemia, with elevated ST segments. However, his coronaries were reported as clean, suggesting demand ischemia. Troponin levels are reassuring. The patient is on a statin at 40 mg and ASA 81 mg, which has been temporarily held due to bleeding.

The patient has a history of COPD, but it is rare in patients without a smoking history. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his respiratory symptoms. A follow-up CT scan of the thorax and contact with the primary care physician are recommended.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man who presented with hypotension and septic shock. The assessment indicates that the patient has septic shock related to Clostridium difficile colitis. The patient's symptoms are resolving, and he is off levophed. The plan includes administering PO Vanc/IV flagyl, following GI recommendations, using probiotics when off antibiotics, maintaining IVF with a CVP goal of more than 8, and monitoring for bleeding secondary to anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is likely to experience bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy. Measures such as pressure to hold the internal jugular (IJ) site, obtaining blood consent, and transfusing packed red blood cells (PRBCs) have already been implemented.

2. Myocardial ischemia: The patient has elevated ST segments, suggesting myocardial ischemia. However, the clean coronaries per cath report suggests that this may be demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome. The troponin levels are reassuring, indicating no ongoing myocardial injury.

3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 1.5 to 1.2, indicating improvement in renal function. However, the baseline creatinine level is 1.1, and the patient is still at risk for renal failure due to dehydration or prerenal causes. Renal dose medications"

The last doses of antibiotics were given at 10:00 AM, 06:00 PM, and 09:00 PM. Infusions include heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,376 mL and total output of 1,435 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,941 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 98%. Peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, and neurologic examination shows the patient responding but not fully assessed due to intubation.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (19.7 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (10.9 g"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 70-inch tall, elderly male who is cachetic and has scoliosis. He is feeling well and denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. On physical examination, his HEENT shows poor dentition and mildly dry mucus membranes. His neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, and an external jugular vein that is distended. Respiratory examination shows small crackles at the right base. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or distention, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show strong pulses in both upper and lower limbs, and sensation is intact. Neurological examination reveals a resting tremor but otherwise normal findings.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (normal range 85-97 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 103/61 mmHg to 123/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (normal range 17-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 6 mmHg (normal range 0-10 mmHg) with a total fluid intake of 3,376 mL and output of 1"

   1. Bilateral pulmonary consolidations, left more than right, could
   reflect aspiration pneumonia in the setting of hiatal hernia. There is
   also an abnormal appearance to the hypopharynx, which is gas-distended
   with apparent external laryngoceles, which may relate to aspiration
   risk.
   2. Massively distended sigmoid colon measuring up to 10.3 cm. There is
   a transition point at the rectosigmoid junction with fullness in the
   rectum and associated mural edema. Overall, these findings reflect
   potential rectosigmoid obstruction possibly from volvulus, occult mass
   or stricture. Within limitations on non-contrast evaluation, no
   associated secondary signs of
   inflammation or ischemia were noted.
   3. Cystic structure adjacent to the proximal third part of duodenum as
   described above may represent a duodenal duplication cyst/fluid-filled
   duodenal diverticulum. Other differential considerations include cystic
   neoplasm or, less likely, aneurysm, overall incompletely evaluated in
   the non- contrast setting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man who presented with hypotension and septic shock due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. His symptoms are resolving with antibiotic treatment and fluid resuscitation. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with beta-blockers and digoxin. He also has a history of bleeding, myocardial ischemia, renal failure, Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, back pain, hypertension, and gastrointestinal issues. The patient's current medications include statins, ASA, metformin, probiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and anticoagulants. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk for further complications related to septic shock, such as organ dysfunction, multiple organ failure, and death.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient may experience a recurrence or worsening of C. diff colitis, leading to diarrhea, abdominal pain, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to an increased risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
4. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding tendency may increase due to anticoagulant therapy, resulting in hemorrhagic complications.
5. Myocard"

The patient is on pressors, and tube feeds have been withheld to allow the bowel to rest.

The patient's physical examination reveals scoliosis, poor dentition, external jugular vein distension, crackles at the right base of the lungs, and a resting tremor. His neurologic examination is otherwise unremarkable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). His creatinine (Cr) has improved from previous levels, and"

","The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection who presented with septic shock. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, back pain due to chronic spinal stenosis, hypertension, and C. diff colitis.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving several medications, including diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and vancomycin for C. diff infection. He is also on prophylactic heparin, metoprolol, and statin therapy.

His vital signs show a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 to 119/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient's central venous pressure is 5 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 4,055 mL and output of 495 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination reveals scoliosis, poor dentition, dry but intact mucus membranes, supple neck, regular heart sounds, clear lung fields, soft abdomen, distal pulses present, intact sensation, and a resting tremor consistent with Parkinson"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, who presented with septic shock and is now improving. He has leukocytosis of unclear etiology, but it does not appear to be an infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is off levophed. He has a pressure ulcer that is improving, and his abdominal exam is benign with minimal diarrhea. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, for which he received diltiazem drip and converted back to sinus rhythm. He also has myocardial ischemia, but with reassuring troponin levels. The patient has Parkinson's disease and chronic spinal stenosis. His hypertension is currently well-controlled, and he is holding antihypertensive medications due to septic shock. 

The patient's assessment includes refractory C. diff colitis, leukocytosis, pressure ulcer, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, myocardial ischemia, Parkinson's disease, and chronic spinal stenosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of refractory C. diff infection, which is a type of bacterial infection. There is a potential risk of developing another infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization.

2. Pressure Ulcer: The patient has a pressure ulcer that"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic [**Month/Year (2) 281**] [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology. Clinically does not appear to be
   infected above and beyond his C.diff. Appears to be improving. No rash
   or fever to indicate drug reaction. Abd exam benign, diarrhea
   resolving, no other obvious source. Consider pericarditis, if
   hemodynamics worsen get stat ECHO.
   -  check diff for eos
   -  check UA/cx
   -  repeat  CBC in am for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be aberrant value
   - Follow CXRs
   # C.diff.  Pressured improved and stable off levophed.  Abdominal exam
   benign and very little diarrhea.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat.  Likely secondary to fluid hydration for
   sepsi. Converted yesterday am with diltiazem drip. Diltiazem, d/c
   - monitor
   - No need to anticoagulate for single episode of a-fib in setting of
   treating septic [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] monitor, and consider anticoagulation if
   afib repeats.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation
   would also be consistent with pericarditis.  Echocardiogram showed no
   evidence of restrictive heart disease.  Troponins are reassuring.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   - consider stat ECHO if hemodynamics change
   - recheck lactate
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per wound care note.
   -          viualized today
   -          monitor
   -          frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension: Held antihypertensives in setting of septic [**First Name3 (LF) 281**].
   Currently normotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Difficult situation of poor swallowing function and NG tube
   curled stomach w/ hiatal hernia.
   - replete lytes prn.  Colace/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with
   colitis and diarrhea.
   - Speech and swallow consult. Suggests consider PEG placement for long
   term nutrition, currently swallow is poor and pt should only have small
   amounts of thickened fluids.
   - IR for manipulation of NG tube into position below the diaphragm.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia
   # Glycemic control: BS well controlled with SSI.
   # Lines: PIV times 2. R IJ
 maintain for now, c/s d/cing tonight or
   tomorrow dep on clinical condition.
   - IR for PICC placement
   # PPx: subq heparin. D/c
d protonix for increased risk of C. diff.
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 209**] [**Name (NI) 1800**] (Nephew): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1801**]
   # Code: DNR/DNI but could reverse if intubation likely to be temporary
   # Dispo: Likely to floor later today if remains stable after PICC/NG

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C. diff presenting with septic C. diff colitis. He has leukocytosis of unclear etiology, which does not appear to be infected above and beyond his C. diff. His vital signs are stable, and he is improving. The patient's medical history includes Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus, chronic spinal stenosis, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia. He is currently being treated for C. diff with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole, and his abdominal exam is benign with very little diarrhea. He also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has converted to sinus rhythm with diltiazem drip. The patient's myocardial ischemia is being managed with a statin and close monitoring for any changes in hemodynamics. He has a sacral decubitus that is mild and is being managed with wound care. The patient's back pain is related to chronic spinal stenosis and is being treated with Vicodin. His hypertension is currently controlled, but he is holding antihypertensives due to his recent septic episode. The patient has poor swallowing function and a hiatal hernia, which require further evaluation and management. His glycemic control is well-managed with subcutaneous insulin. The patient has multiple lines in place, including PIV times two and an IJ line, which will be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C.difficile infection who presented with septic C.difficile colitis. The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with an unclear etiology. There are no signs of infection, rash, or fever to indicate a drug reaction. The abdominal examination is benign, and diarrhea is resolving. No other obvious source of infection has been found. The possibility of pericarditis is being considered if the patient's hemodynamics worsen.

2. Clostridium difficile (C.diff): The patient's C.difficile infection appears to be improving. The pressured improved and stable off levophed. The abdominal exam is benign with very little diarrhea. The patient will continue receiving PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl for 14 days, follow GI recommendations, and monitor blood cultures.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (A Fib with RVR): The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. This is likely secondary to fluid hydration for sepsis. The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm yesterday morning with a diltiazem drip. Diltiazem should be discontinued, and the patient should be monitored. There is no need to anticoagulate for a single episode of A Fib in the setting of treating septicemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic [**Month/Year (2) 281**] [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology. Clinically does not appear to be
   infected above and beyond his C.diff. Appears to be improving. No rash
   or fever to indicate drug reaction. Abd exam benign, diarrhea
   resolving, no other obvious source. Consider pericarditis, if
   hemodynamics worsen get stat ECHO.
   -  check diff for eos
   -  check UA/cx
   -  repeat  CBC in am for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be aberrant value
   - Follow CXRs
   # C.diff.  Pressured improved and stable off levophed.  Abdominal exam
   benign and very little diarrhea.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat.  Likely secondary to fluid hydration for
   sepsi. Converted yesterday am with diltiazem drip. Diltiazem, d/c
   - monitor
   - No need to anticoagulate for single episode of a-fib in setting of
   treating septic [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] monitor, and consider anticoagulation if
   afib repeats.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: Elevated ST segments in setting of clean
   coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such diffuse elevation
   would also be consistent with pericarditis.  Echocardiogram showed no
   evidence of restrictive heart disease.  Troponins are reassuring.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   - consider stat ECHO if hemodynamics change
   - recheck lactate
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per wound care note.
   -          viualized today
   -          monitor
   -          frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension: Held antihypertensives in setting of septic [**First Name3 (LF) 281**].
   Currently normotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Difficult situation of poor swallowing function and NG tube
   curled stomach w/ hiatal hernia.
   - replete lytes prn.  Colace/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with
   colitis and diarrhea.
   - Speech and swallow consult. Suggests consider PEG placement for long
   term nutrition, currently swallow is poor and pt should only have small
   amounts of thickened fluids.
   - IR for manipulation of NG tube into position below the diaphragm.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia
   # Glycemic control: BS well controlled with SSI.
   # Lines: PIV times 2. R IJ
 maintain for now, c/s d/cing tonight or
   tomorrow dep on clinical condition.
   - IR for PICC placement
   # PPx: subq heparin. D/c
d protonix for increased risk of C. diff.
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 209**] [**Name (NI) 1800**] (Nephew): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1801**]
   # Code: DNR/DNI but could reverse if intubation likely to be temporary
   # Dispo: Likely to floor later today if remains stable after PICC/NG
   procedures.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection presenting with septic C. diff colitis. The patient's current condition is improving. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. Further investigation is needed to determine the etiology.

2. Pericarditis: The patient's elevated ST segments in the EKG suggest myocardial ischemia, which could be due to demand ischemia or pericarditis. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics is necessary, and an echocardiogram should be considered if there are any changes.

3. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a mild grade II sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires regular turning and wound care to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypotension and tachycardia: The patient has been started on Neo for hypotension with tachycardia. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential to ensure adequate blood pressure and heart rate.

5. Parkinson's disease: The patient is already on medication for Parkinson's disease management. Regular monitoring of symptoms and adherence to the medication regimen are crucial.

6. Chronic spinal stenosis: The patient has chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis. Non"

   signs of tamponade
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension: CVP of 9 and urine output suggest pt is euvolemic. The
   hypotension and EF >75% w/o clear diastolic failure, would still
   suggest intravscularl depleation, as does the Na of 146. Pitting edema,
   and rapid pulmonary edema yesterday suggest need for cautious hydration
   and CVP support, and free water repletion, for a free water deficit of
   approx 1.5 L.  Currently needing pressor support w/ Neo at
   0.8mcg/kg/min.
   -wean pressors as tolerated
   -cautious fluid boluses of 250cc for hypotension, reassess throughout
   day
   -Free water flushes w/ tube feeds for borderline hypernatremia
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology. Clinically does not appear to be
   infected above and beyond his C.diff. Appears to be improving. No rash
   or fever to indicate drug reaction, no increase in Eos. Abd exam
   benign, diarrhea resolving, no other obvious source. Considered
   pericarditis, but no evidence on ECHO yesterday.  No UTI. Most likely
   still [**3-9**] colonic inflammation from colitis.
   -follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   -trend WBC
   - resend sputum cx
   # C.diff.  Pressured improved and stable off levophed.  Abdominal exam
   benign and very little diarrhea.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   - ABX broadened yesterday with hypotension and pulmonary edema, will
   reduce back down to PO Vanc/IV Flagyl (D/c
d zosyn and IV vanc)
   - Per GI recs will start IV IG therapy for C-diff, will consider
   addition of probiotics or fecal transplant in future.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode yesterday, converted
   after amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone
   and digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - will convert IV amiodarone to PO, at 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Dig level will be checked this PM and pt will continue w/ 0.125mg PO
   either daily or every other day depending on [**Last Name (un) **].
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   - recheck lactates

   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension: Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) who presented with septic shock and is now improving. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure suggests intravascular depletion. The sodium level of 146 indicates a need for cautious hydration and CVP support.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count has an unclear etiology. It does not appear to be due to an infection, as there is no fever or rash, and the abdominal exam is benign. The leukocytosis could be a result of colonic inflammation from C. diff colitis.

3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient had elevated ST segments on presentation, but the coronary arteries were clean per cath report. This could indicate demand ischemia or diffuse elevation consistent with pericarditis. The echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease, and troponins are reassuring.

4. Parkinson's disease: The patient is currently on Senemet 25-100 TID for Parkinson's disease. Regular monitoring and management of Parkinson's symptoms should continue.

5. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a mild sacral decubitus ulcer that requires frequent turns and wound care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C. diff who presented with septic shock. He has been improving and is now in the ICU for further management. The patient has several medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, chronic spinal stenosis, myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. He also has a sacral decubitus ulcer, pitting edema, and rapid pulmonary edema. The patient is on multiple medications, including IVIG, amiodarone, digoxin, and proton pump inhibitors. He is currently receiving IV fluids and antibiotics for C. diff colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure suggests intravascular depletion. Cautious hydration and central venous pressure (CVP) support should be continued.
2. Leukocytosis: Although the patient's white blood cell count is improving, it is still elevated. Monitoring for any signs of infection and following CXRs for evolving pneumonia is important.
3. C. diff colitis: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain may indicate ongoing C. diff infection. Continuing PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days as per GI recommendations is necessary.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Monitoring and continuing IV amiodarone and digoxin is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension: CVP of 9 and urine output suggest pt is euvolemic. The
   hypotension and EF >75% w/o clear diastolic failure, would still
   suggest intravscularl depleation, as does the Na of 146. Pitting edema,
   and rapid pulmonary edema yesterday suggest need for cautious hydration
   and CVP support, and free water repletion, for a free water deficit of
   approx 1.5 L.  Currently needing pressor support w/ Neo at
   0.8mcg/kg/min.
   -wean pressors as tolerated
   -cautious fluid boluses of 250cc for hypotension, reassess throughout
   day
   -Free water flushes w/ tube feeds for borderline hypernatremia
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology. Clinically does not appear to be
   infected above and beyond his C.diff. Appears to be improving. No rash
   or fever to indicate drug reaction, no increase in Eos. Abd exam
   benign, diarrhea resolving, no other obvious source. Considered
   pericarditis, but no evidence on ECHO yesterday.  No UTI. Most likely
   still [**3-9**] colonic inflammation from colitis.
   -follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   -trend WBC
   - resend sputum cx
   # C.diff.  Pressured improved and stable off levophed.  Abdominal exam
   benign and very little diarrhea.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   - ABX broadened yesterday with hypotension and pulmonary edema, will
   reduce back down to PO Vanc/IV Flagyl (D/c
d zosyn and IV vanc)
   - Per GI recs will start IV IG therapy for C-diff, will consider
   addition of probiotics or fecal transplant in future.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode yesterday, converted
   after amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone
   and digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - will convert IV amiodarone to PO, at 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Dig level will be checked this PM and pt will continue w/ 0.125mg PO
   either daily or every other day depending on [**Last Name (un) **].
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   - recheck lactates
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per wound care note.
   - visualize today, monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension: Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.
   - replete lytes prn.  Colace/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with
   colitis and diarrhea.
   - start TFs today per nutrition recs.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia and longterm planning

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C. difficile infection, septic shock, and multiple medical complications. He presented with septic shock due to C. difficile colitis and is currently improving. The patient has been receiving IVIG therapy for C. difficile and will continue with PO Vanc/IV Flagyl for 14 days. 

The patient has been experiencing leukocytosis with an unclear etiology, but it appears to be improving without any obvious source of infection. His abdominal exam is benign, and there is no evidence of pericarditis or urinary tract infection. 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has had two episodes. He has been converted after administration of amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. He will continue on IV amiodarone and digoxin. 

Furthermore, the patient had myocardial ischemia on presentation but had clean coronaries per cath report, suggesting demand ischemia. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease. Troponins are reassuring, and repeat ECHO did not show any increase in effusion or signs of pericarditis. 

The patient has Parkinson's disease and is currently being treated with Senemet 25-100 TID. He also has a sacral decubitus ulcer that is very mild and will be visualized today. 

In addition, the patient has chronic spinal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension: The hypotension and EF >75% w/o clear diastolic failure,
   would still suggest intravascular depletion, as does the Na of 146.
   Pitting edema, and rapid pulmonary edema 2 days ago suggest need for
   cautious hydration and CVP support
   -pressors weaned off over night
   -cautious fluid boluses of 250cc for hypotension, reassess throughout
   day
   -small free water flushes w/ tube feeds for borderline hypernatremia
   - trend sodium w/ pm lytes, if start to rise again, consider 500cc-1L
   IV free water
   # Leukocytosis: Improving somewhat today w/ stable hematocrit.
   Clinically does not appear to be infected above and beyond his C.diff.
   Appears to be improving. No rash or fever to indicate drug reaction, no
   increase in Eos. Abd exam benign, diarrhea slowly resolving, no other
   obvious source. Considered pericarditis, but no evidence on ECHO.  No
   UTI. Most likely still [**3-9**] colonic inflammation from colitis.
   -follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   -trend WBC
   -resend sputum cx if possible
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam benign and diarrhea
   continues but is less.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Per GI recs gave IV IG therapy for C-diff last night, tolerated well.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode yesterday, converted
   after amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone
   and digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - continue 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day, will follow levels.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per nursing.
   - dressed by wound care, will change q3days, no erythema currently,
   monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension: Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.
   - replete lytes prn.  Colace/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with
   colitis and diarrhea.
   - continue TFs today wi/ free water flushes.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia and longterm planning
   - For his dry mouth, change to humidified air on scoop mask
   # Glycemic control: BS well controlled with SSI.
   # Lines: Right PICC line.  Clotted, trying TPA, will, reassess after 1
   hour,  call PICC team if fails.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C.difficile infection presenting with septic shock. He has been improving and is now in the ICU for further management. The patient has several medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, chronic spinal stenosis, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, and hypertension. He also has pitting edema and rapid pulmonary edema, which suggest intravascular depletion. The patient's white blood cell count is leukocytosis but appears to be improving. He is currently receiving IV antibiotics and IV immunoglobulin therapy for C.difficile. The patient's atrial fibrillation was converted back to sinus rhythm after being treated with amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. He continues to be on IV amiodarone and digoxin. The patient's myocardial ischemia is being managed with a statin, and his hypertension is being monitored rather than treated due to recent hypotension. The patient has poor swallowing function and is being considered for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for long-term nutrition. His sacral decubitus is mild and will be monitored. The patient's glycemic control is well managed with sliding scale insulin (SSI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intravascular depletion: The patient's hypotension, pitting edema, and rapid pulmonary edema suggest intravascular depletion. Close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload:  Currently
   normotensive with low urine output.  Put . Pitting edema, and rapid
   pulmonary edema 2 days ago suggest need for cautious hydration and CVP
   support
   -pressors weaned off over night
   -cautious fluid boluses of 250cc for hypotension, reassess throughout
   day
   -small free water flushes w/ tube feeds for borderline hypernatremia
   - trend sodium w/ pm lytes, if start to rise again, consider 500cc-1L
   IV free water
   - p.m. lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Improving somewhat today w/ stable hematocrit.
   Clinically does not appear to be infected above and beyond his C.diff.
   Appears to be improving. No rash or fever to indicate drug reaction, no
   increase in Eos. Abd exam benign, diarrhea slowly resolving, no other
   obvious source. Considered pericarditis, but no evidence on ECHO.  No
   UTI. Most likely still [**3-9**] colonic inflammation from colitis.
   -follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   -trend WBC
   -resend sputum cx if possible
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam benign and diarrhea
   continues but is less.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Per GI recs gave IV IG therapy for C-diff last night, tolerated well.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**10-30**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - continue 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day, will follow levels.  Check next level tomorrow.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg
   - ASA 81 mg
   # Parkinson
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per nursing.
   - dressed by wound care, will change q3days, no erythema currently,
   monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension:  Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.
   - replete lytes prn.
   - phos 2.1.  replete.
   - Colace/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with colitis and diarrhea.
   - continue TFs today w/ free water flushes.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia and longterm planning
   - For his dry mouth, change to humidified air on scoop mask, continue
   swabs, and oral hygiene
   # Glycemic control: BS well controlled with SSI.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C. difficile infection who presented with septic shock due to C. difficile colitis. He is currently improving and shows no signs of infection other than the colitis. His leukocytosis is also improving. He remains on PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days and will follow GI recommendations. He received IV IG therapy for C. difficile last night, which he tolerated well.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was converted after episodes of atrial fibrillation. He is currently on IV amiodarone and digoxin, and his ECG shows no evidence of pericarditis.

He had myocardial ischemia on presentation, but his troponins are reassuring and echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease. He had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion or signs of pericarditis. The patient has had no chest pain at any point.

He has Parkinson's disease and is currently on Senemet 25-100 TID. He has a sacral decubitus ulcer that is currently mild and well-dressed. He also has chronic spinal stenosis and is taking Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN for back pain.

His hypertension was held during septic shock but is now being monitored. He is currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive. His"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload:  Currently
   normotensive with low urine output.  Put . Pitting edema, and rapid
   pulmonary edema 2 days ago suggest need for cautious hydration and CVP
   support
   -pressors weaned off over night
   -cautious fluid boluses of 250cc for hypotension, reassess throughout
   day
   -small free water flushes w/ tube feeds for borderline hypernatremia
   - trend sodium w/ pm lytes, if start to rise again, consider 500cc-1L
   IV free water
   - p.m. lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Improving somewhat today w/ stable hematocrit.
   Clinically does not appear to be infected above and beyond his C.diff.
   Appears to be improving. No rash or fever to indicate drug reaction, no
   increase in Eos. Abd exam benign, diarrhea slowly resolving, no other
   obvious source. Considered pericarditis, but no evidence on ECHO.  No
   UTI. Most likely still [**3-9**] colonic inflammation from colitis.
   -follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   -trend WBC
   -resend sputum cx if possible
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam benign and diarrhea
   continues but is less.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Per GI recs gave IV IG therapy for C-diff last night, tolerated well.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**10-30**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - continue 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day, will follow levels.  Check next level tomorrow.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg

   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C.diff who presented with septic shock due to C.diff colitis. He is currently improving, with low urine output and pitting edema. The patient has leukocytosis but no signs of infection except for the C.diff colitis. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and myocardial ischemia. The patient is also diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and chronic spinal stenosis. His blood glucose levels are well-controlled with SSI. The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer but it is currently mild. He is being considered for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to poor swallowing function. The patient's lines are in place, including a right PICC line with one open port for infusion. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, but could be reversed if intubation is temporary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume overload: The patient has shown signs of rapid pulmonary edema and pitting edema, indicating a need for cautious hydration and central venous pressure (CVP) support.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but there is a concern for hypotension due to the septic shock and low urine output.
3. C.difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C.difficile colitis and is currently being treated with"

   interval improvement in left retrocardiac opacity which is likely
   atelectasis. Otherwise, no significant change from previous study.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload:  Currently
   normotensive, with low urine output, pleural effusions, and peripheral
   edema.  Made about 900 cc of urine yesterday [**10-31**] after receiving Lasix
   40 mg IV, but then urine output dropped off again.  Creatinine stable.
   Will attempt further diuresis today.
   - gentle diuresis with Lasix today
   - monitor vitals, creatinine, and urine output
   - give free water 200 mL Q6H via NG tube
   - p.m. lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Stable today at 19.  No rash or fever to indicate drug
   reaction.  No UTI.  Sputum cultured cancelled due to extensive
   contamination with upper respiratory secretions.  Most likely still [**3-9**]
   colonic inflammation from colitis.
   - monitor for fever, trend WBC
   - follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   - follow blood cultures
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam distended but
   non-tender.  Diarrhea continues.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**10-30**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - continue 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day, will follow levels.  Check dig level next level tomorrow [**2165-11-2**].
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg
   - ASA 81 mg
   # Parkinson
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per nursing.
   - dressed by wound care, will change q3days, no erythema currently,
   monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension:  Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.
   - replete lytes prn.
   - phos 2.1.  replete.
   - Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with colitis and diarrhea.
   - continue TFs today w/ free water flushes.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia and long-term planning
   - For his dry mouth, change to humidified air on scoop mask, continue
   swabs, and oral hygiene

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection who presented with septic shock due to C. diff colitis. His current conditions include hypotension, low urine output, volume overload, leukocytosis, C. diff septic shock resolving, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, myocardial ischemia, Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic spinal stenosis, hypertension, and poor swallowing function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable but there is a concern for recurrent hypotension due to septic shock and volume overload.
2. Low Urine Output: The patient's urine output is low, which can indicate renal dysfunction or dehydration.
3. Volume Overload: The patient has pleural effusions and peripheral edema, indicating fluid overload.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammation.
5. C. diff Colitis: The patient has an ongoing infection with C. diff, which can cause diarrhea and abdominal pain.
6. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which increases the risk of stroke and heart failure.
7. Myocardial Ischemia: The patient had elevated ST segments on presentation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU. They have a history of poor urine output overnight but maintained good blood pressures and mental status. A PICC line was attempted but could not be drawn off initially; however, it can now be used for infusion. The patient has multiple allergies and received antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin) within the last 24 hours. They are currently on several medications including Furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate between 97-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/62 to 112/66 mmHg, respiratory rate between 28-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,279 mL with 986 mL given through the PO route, 786 mL through TF, 499 mL through IVF, and 135 mL of blood products. Output includes 2,653 mL through urine, 500 mL each of NG and stool, and 650 mL drained from a port. The fluid balance is positive at 626 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension: The hypotension and EF >75% w/o clear diastolic failure,
   would still suggest intravascular depletion, as does the Na of 146.
   Pitting edema, and rapid pulmonary edema 2 days ago suggest need for
   cautious hydration and CVP support
   -pressors weaned off over night
   -cautious fluid boluses of 250cc for hypotension, reassess throughout
   day
   -small free water flushes w/ tube feeds for borderline hypernatremia
   - trend sodium w/ pm lytes, if start to rise again, consider 500cc-1L
   IV free water
   # Leukocytosis: Improving somewhat today w/ stable hematocrit.
   Clinically does not appear to be infected above and beyond his C.diff.
   Appears to be improving. No rash or fever to indicate drug reaction, no
   increase in Eos. Abd exam benign, diarrhea slowly resolving, no other
   obvious source. Considered pericarditis, but no evidence on ECHO.  No
   UTI. Most likely still [**3-9**] colonic inflammation from colitis.
   -follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   -trend WBC
   -resend sputum cx if possible
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam benign and diarrhea
   continues but is less.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Per GI recs gave IV IG therapy for C-diff last night, tolerated well.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode yesterday, converted
   after amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone
   and digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - continue 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day, will follow levels.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg, hold ASA 81 mg given bleeding
   # Parkinsons
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per nursing.
   - dressed by wound care, will change q3days, no erythema currently,
   monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension: Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.
   - replete lytes prn.  Colace/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with
   colitis and diarrhea.
   - continue TFs today w/ free water flushes.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia and longterm planning
   - For his dry mouth, change to humidified air on scoop mask, continue
   swabs, and oral hygiene
   # Glycemic control: BS well controlled with SSI.
   # Lines: Right PICC line.  Clotted, trying TPA, will, reassess after 1
   hour, call PICC team if fails.
   # PPx: subq heparin. D/c
d protonix for increased risk of C. diff.
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 209**] [**Name (NI) 1800**] (Nephew): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1801**]
   # Code: DNR/DNI but could reverse if intubation likely to be temporary
   # Dispo: ICU for now, is being screened for rehab.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection who presented with septic shock. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently improving. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure suggests intravascular depletion. Cautious hydration and central venous pressure (CVP) support should be considered.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count indicates an infection. It is important to monitor the trend and ensure there are no signs of worsening infection.
3. C. diff colitis: The patient has a history of refractory C. diff infection, and it is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and follow gastrointestinal (GI) recommendations.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium levels are borderline hypernatremia. Frequent monitoring and small free water flushes may be necessary.
5. Myocardial ischemia: The patient had elevated ST segments on presentation, which could be due to demand ischemia or pericarditis. Monitoring and appropriate cardiac medications are recommended.
6. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a mild sacral decubitus ulcer that needs to be monitored and dressed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload: The hypotension and
   EF >75% w/o clear diastolic failure, would still suggest intravascular
   depletion, as does the Na of 146. Pitting edema, and rapid pulmonary
   edema 2 days ago suggest need for cautious hydration and CVP support
   -pressors weaned off over night
   -cautious fluid boluses of 250cc for hypotension, reassess throughout
   day
   -small free water flushes w/ tube feeds for borderline hypernatremia
   - trend sodium w/ pm lytes, if start to rise again, consider 500cc-1L
   IV free water
   - p.m. lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Improving somewhat today w/ stable hematocrit.
   Clinically does not appear to be infected above and beyond his C.diff.
   Appears to be improving. No rash or fever to indicate drug reaction, no
   increase in Eos. Abd exam benign, diarrhea slowly resolving, no other
   obvious source. Considered pericarditis, but no evidence on ECHO.  No
   UTI. Most likely still [**3-9**] colonic inflammation from colitis.
   -follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   -trend WBC
   -resend sputum cx if possible
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam benign and diarrhea
   continues but is less.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Per GI recs gave IV IG therapy for C-diff last night, tolerated well.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**10-30**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - continue 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day, will follow levels.  Check next level tomorrow.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg
   - ASA 81 mg
   # Parkinson
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub

   monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension:  Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.
   - replete lytes prn.
   - phos 2.1.  replete.
   - Colace/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with colitis and diarrhea.
   - continue TFs today w/ free water flushes.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia and longterm planning
   - For his dry mouth, change to humidified air on scoop mask, continue
   swabs, and oral hygiene

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C. difficile infection who presented with septic shock. He is currently improving and showing signs of recovery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Low Urine Output/Volume Overload: The patient's hypotension and low urine output suggest intravascular depletion. The presence of pitting edema and rapid pulmonary edema indicates the need for cautious hydration and central venous pressure (CVP) support.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving but may indicate ongoing inflammation from C. difficile colitis.
3. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a history of refractory C. difficile infection and is currently being treated with vancomycin and IV immunoglobulin therapy.
4. Myocardial Ischemia: The patient had elevated ST segments on presentation, suggesting myocardial ischemia. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram did not show evidence of pericarditis.
5. Parkinson's Disease: The patient has Parkinson's disease and is being treated with Senemet.
6. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a mild sacral decubitus ulcer that requires frequent turns and wound care.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be monitored, and antihypertensive medications may need to be restarted.
8. Poor Swallowing Function"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff presented
   with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload:  Currently
   normotensive, with good urine production on lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and renal
   function is stable w/ Cr at 0.8. Pleural effusions, and peripheral
   edema stable or improving. Will continue cautious diuresis as pt is
   still volume overloaded.
   - Lasix 40mg IV BID
   - monitor vitals, creatinine, and urine output
   - Hypernatremia resolved, will decrease free water flushes from 200 to
   150 mL Q6H via NG tube
   # Leukocytosis: Improving now at 15.6, down from 34 at peak.  Likely
   etiology is from his c-diff colitis. No rash or fever to indicate drug
   reaction.  No UTI.  Blood and urine cxs neg to date.
   - monitor for fever, trend WBC
   - follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   - follow blood cultures
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam distended but
   non-tender.  Diarrhea continues, but may be improving slightly.
   - Taper abx per GI recs: see d/c instructions
   - Follow blood cultures
   # [**Hospital1 **] bleed?: ASA 81 was restarted 2 days ago, developed some red flecks
   and grossly heme positive reddish stool yesterday.
   - d/c
d ASA 81
   - held Heparin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct checks, stable so far.
   - guaiac stools.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**10-30**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin, no further episodes.
   - monitor
   - continue amiodarone 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day.  Check dig level with am labs tomorrow.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg
   - ASA 81 mg was restarted 2 days ago, guaiac pos stools yesterday,
   d/c
d this morning.
   # Parkinson
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per nursing.
   - dressed by wound care, will change q3days, monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med), has not complained of
   any pain on this admission
   # Hypertension:  Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs. TFs have been tolerated well.
   - replete lytes prn.
   - Ca and Mg repleated yesterday, 40mEq of KCl IV given this am.
   - Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with colitis and diarrhea.
   - continue TFs w/ free water flushes.
   - f/u GI recs
   - For his dry mouth, use humidified air on scoop mask, swabs, and oral
   hygiene

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease with hiatal hernia. He presented with septic shock secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. His current condition is improving, but he still has some complications such as hypotension, volume overload, leukocytosis, C. diff diarrhea, possible gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, myocardial ischemia, and sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is off pressors. He is tolerating gentle diuresis and has good urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Volume Overload: The patient is still volume overloaded, as evidenced by peripheral edema and fluid balance data. Continued cautious diuresis with Lasix will be needed to manage this.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to C. diff colitis. Monitoring for fever and trends in WBC count is important. Follow-up CXRs and blood cultures should be done.
4. C. diff Colitis: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal distension suggest ongoing C. diff infection. Tapering"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff presented
   with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload:  Currently
   normotensive, with good urine production on lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and renal
   function is stable w/ Cr at 0.8. Pleural effusions, and peripheral
   edema stable or improving. Will continue cautious diuresis as pt is
   still volume overloaded.
   - Lasix 40mg IV BID
   - monitor vitals, creatinine, and urine output
   - Hypernatremia resolved, will decrease free water flushes from 200 to
   150 mL Q6H via NG tube
   # Leukocytosis: Improving now at 15.6, down from 34 at peak.  Likely
   etiology is from his c-diff colitis. No rash or fever to indicate drug
   reaction.  No UTI.  Blood and urine cxs neg to date.
   - monitor for fever, trend WBC
   - follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   - follow blood cultures
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam distended but
   non-tender.  Diarrhea continues, but may be improving slightly.
   - Taper abx per GI recs: see d/c instructions
   - Follow blood cultures
   # [**Hospital1 **] bleed?: ASA 81 was restarted 2 days ago, developed some red flecks
   and grossly heme positive reddish stool yesterday.

   - held Heparin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct checks, stable so far.
   - guaiac stools.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**10-30**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin, no further episodes.
   - monitor
   - continue amiodarone 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day.  Check dig level with am labs tomorrow.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg

   any pain on this admission
   # Hypertension:  Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs. TFs have been tolerated well.
   - replete lytes prn.
   - Ca and Mg repleated yesterday, 40mEq of KCl IV given this am.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C. diff presenting with septic shock, which is now improving. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypotension, low urine output, volume overload, leukocytosis, C. diff colitis, myocardial ischemia, Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic spinal stenosis, hypertension, and poor swallowing function.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Bleeding: The patient developed red flecks and grossly heme-positive reddish stool after restarting ASA 81, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. Further evaluation is required, and ASA 81 should be discontinued.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to his C. diff colitis. Monitoring for fever and trends in WBC count is important.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had an elevated sodium level, which has since resolved. Free water flushes via NG tube will be decreased from 200 to 150 mL Q6H.

4. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive but is now normotensive with good urine production on Lasix 40mg. Renal function remains stable with a creatinine level of 0.8. Cautious diuresis will continue.

5. Sacral decub"

   normotensive, with low urine output, pleural effusions, and peripheral
   edema.  Made about 900 cc of urine [**10-31**] after receiving Lasix 40 mg IV,
   but then urine output dropped off again.  Creatinine stable.  Will
   attempt further diuresis today.
   - Lasix 20 mg likely low for him, would increase.  Will discuss
   diuresis options with nursing home.
   - monitor vitals, creatinine, and urine output

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) who presented with septic shock due to C. diff colitis. The patient's current condition is improving. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension/low urine output/volume overload: The patient is currently normotensive but has low urine output and pleural effusions. Further diuresis will be attempted to manage this condition.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has stable leukocyte count but may develop complications related to leukocytosis such as infection or inflammation.
3. C. diff septic shock: Although the patient's condition is improving, there is still a risk of recurrence or complications related to C. diff infection.
4. Parkinson's disease: The patient is on medication for Parkinson's disease, and any adjustments in medication dosage or side effects need to be monitored.
5. Sacral decubitus: The patient has a mild sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires regular monitoring and appropriate wound care.
6. Back pain: The patient has chronic spinal stenosis and experiences back pain, which should be managed with pain relief medication as needed.
7. Hypertension: The patient's antihypertensive medications were held during septic shock, and now that the patient's blood pressure is stable, they can be gradually reintroduced.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff presented
   with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload:  Currently
   normotensive, with low urine output, pleural effusions, and peripheral
   edema.  Made about 900 cc of urine [**10-31**] after receiving Lasix 40 mg IV,
   but then urine output dropped off again.  Creatinine stable.  Will
   attempt further diuresis today.
   - Lasix 20 mg likely low for him, would increase.  Will discuss
   diuresis options with nursing home.
   - monitor vitals, creatinine, and urine output
   - give free water 200 mL Q6H via NG tube
   - p.m. lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Stable today at 19.  No rash or fever to indicate drug
   reaction.  No UTI.  Sputum culture cancelled by lab due to extensive
   contamination with upper respiratory secretions.  Most likely still [**3-9**]
   colonic inflammation from colitis.
   - monitor for fever, trend WBC
   - follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   - follow blood cultures
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam distended but
   non-tender.  Diarrhea continues.
   - Taper per GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**10-30**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - continue 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   follow levels.  Check dig level next level QOD
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg
   - ASA 81 mg
   # Parkinson
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per nursing.
   - dressed by wound care, will change q3days, monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension:  Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.
   - replete lytes prn.
   - phos 2.1 today.  replete.
   - Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with colitis and diarrhea.
   - continue TFs today w/ free water flushes.
   - f/u GI recs
   - For his dry mouth, use humidified air on scoop mask, swabs, and oral
   hygiene
   # Glycemic control: BS well controlled with SSI.
   # Lines: Right PICC line.  1 out of 2 ports can be drawn off.  Both
   open for infusion.
   # PPx: Heparin SC.  D/c
d protonix for increased risk of C. diff.
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 209**] [**Name (NI) 1800**] (Nephew): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1801**]
   # Code: DNR/DNI but could reverse if intubation likely to be temporary
   # Dispo: To rehab when bed available
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection who presented with septic shock and is now improving. He has several ongoing medical issues, including hypotension, low urine output, volume overload, leukocytosis, C. diff colitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, myocardial ischemia, Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic spinal stenosis, hypertension, and poor swallowing function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Low urine output/Volume overload: The patient is currently normotensive but has low urine output, pleural effusions, and peripheral edema. He has received Lasix 40 mg IV, but his urine output dropped off again. Further diuresis may be attempted, and his vitals, creatinine, and urine output should be monitored.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable at 19, with no signs of drug reaction or urinary tract infection. Fever and trends in WBC should be monitored, and sputum culture may be reconsidered if necessary.
3. C. diff septic shock resolving: The patient's abdominal exam is distended but non-tender, and he continues to have diarrhea. Tapering of treatment per GI recommendations and monitoring of blood cultures are advised.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular"

   etiology is from his c-diff colitis. No rash or fever to indicate drug
   reaction.  No UTI.  Blood and urine cxs neg to date.
   - monitor for fever, trend WBC
   - follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   - follow blood cultures
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam distended but
   non-tender.  Diarrhea continues, but may be improving slightly.
   - Taper abx per GI recs: see d/c instructions
   - Follow blood cultures
   # [**Hospital1 **] bleed?: ASA 81 was restarted 2 days ago, developed some red flecks
   and grossly heme positive reddish stool yesterday.

   day.  Check dig level with am labs tomorrow.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.

   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs. TFs have been tolerated well.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) who presented with septic shock due to C. diff colitis. He is currently improving, but still has some ongoing issues. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Low Urine Output/Volume Overload: The patient is currently normotensive with good urine production on Lasix 40mg. His renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 0.8. Pleural effusions and peripheral edema are stable or improving. The plan is to continue cautious diuresis as the patient is still volume overloaded.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is improving from a peak of 34 to 15.6. This is likely due to his C. diff colitis. No rash or fever indicates no drug reaction. Blood and urine cultures are negative.
3. C. diff Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is resolving. His abdominal exam is distended but non-tender. Diarrhea continues but may be improving slightly. Antibiotics will be tapered per GI recommendations.
4. Potential ASA-related Bleed: The patient developed some red flecks and grossly heme-positive reddish stool after restarting ASA 81. ASA 81 was discontinued, and heparin was held. Further investigation is needed, including checking Hct levels and conducting"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and has been improving hemodynamically, but still experiences profound weakness and nutritional deficiencies. His hypotension has resolved with hydration, and he is receiving IV and oral Flagyl for C. diff. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, for which he is on digoxin and is now in normal sinus rhythm. His Parkinson's disease medications are being continued at home. In the ICU, he is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube with fiber supplementation, and his blood glucose levels are being monitored due to his SSRI medication. He has a PICC line in place and is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's wishes are documented as DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate). He is expected to stay in the ICU and will be evaluated for potential rehabilitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: Given the patient's current C. diff infection and the presence of multiple lines and tubes, there is a risk of developing other infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin to prevent DVT; however,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with refractory C. diff, hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Parkinson's disease, and sepsis due to C. diff colitis. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments including IV and oral Flagyl for C. diff, Digoxin for atrial fibrillation, and home medications for Parkinson's disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/53-116/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has received fluid resuscitation and is currently being monitored in the ICU. The patient's family history and review of systems remain unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis due to C. diff colitis indicates a serious infection that can lead to organ dysfunction or failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to vital organs. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure and prevent further complications.
3. C. diff Colitis: The patient's refractory C. diff infection increases the risk of complications such as severe diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection who presented with septic shock and is now clinically improving. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hypotension/Low Urine Output/Volume Overload: The patient is currently normotensive with good urine output overnight on IV Lasix (3.4L) and stable creatinine levels. However, the patient is still volume overloaded, so cautious diuresis should continue.

2. C. Difficile (C. diff) Colitis: The patient's C. diff levels are improving from a peak of 34 to 14.6, indicating that the infection is likely resolving. The patient has decreased diarrhea, no urinary tract infection (UTI), and blood and urine cultures are negative. Antibiotics should be tapered for discharge, and the patient should be monitored for fever, trends in white blood cell count (WBC), and follow-up chest X-rays for signs of evolving pneumonia (PNA).

3. History of GI Bleed: The patient had grossly heme-positive reddish stool yesterday, but his hematocrit (Hct) remains stable. It is important to hold aspirin (ASA) 81 and heparin, and guaiac stool tests should be conducted. Hct checks should be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory C. diff who presented with septic shock and is now clinically improving. He has several other medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, chronic spinal stenosis, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current concerns include hypotension/low urine output/volume overload, C. diff colitis, history of GI bleed, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, myocardial ischemia, Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, and chronic spinal stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/low urine output/volume overload: The patient is currently normotensive, but there is a concern for ongoing volume overload. Monitoring vitals, creatinine, and urine output will be important to ensure the patient remains stable.

2. C. diff colitis: The patient's C. diff count is improving, indicating that the colitis is likely resolving. However, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of recurrence or worsening symptoms.

3. History of GI bleed: The patient had grossly heme-positive reddish stool yesterday, which suggests a possible GI bleed. Holding ASA and heparin is appropriate, and further investigation should be done to determine the cause of the bleeding.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old man admitted to the ICU with refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, resulting in septic shock. His current condition is improving, with stable vital signs, good urine output, and stable renal function. He has a history of chronic spinal stenosis, Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypertension. The patient also has pleural effusions, peripheral edema, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. C. diff colitis: The patient has been experiencing loose stools, and although his white blood cell count has decreased, he still has not fully recovered. Monitoring for fever and trends in WBC is necessary. Blood cultures should also be followed.

2. GI bleed: There was an episode of red flecks in the stool three days ago, but the hematocrit level has remained stable. The patient should restart sucralfate and hold aspirin. Guaiac stools should be monitored.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in normal sinus rhythm now but had a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He completed one week of amiodarone loading and was switched to digoxin yesterday. Amiodarone should be continued, and digoxin should be discontinued.

4. ST elevation: The patient had ST elevations on admission, which were attributed to demand"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff presented
   with septic shock [**3-9**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload:  Currently
   normotensive, with good urine production on lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and renal
   function is stable w/ Cr at 0.8. Pleural effusions, and peripheral
   edema stable or improving. Will continue cautious diuresis as pt is
   still volume overloaded.
   - Lasix 40mg IV BID
   - monitor vitals, creatinine, and urine output
   - Hypernatremia resolved, will decrease free water flushes from 200 to
   150 mL Q6H via NG tube
   # Leukocytosis: Improving now at 15.6, down from 34 at peak.  Likely
   etiology is from his c-diff colitis. No rash or fever to indicate drug
   reaction.  No UTI.  Blood and urine cxs neg to date.
   - monitor for fever, trend WBC
   - follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   - follow blood cultures
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam distended but
   non-tender.  Diarrhea continues, but may be improving slightly.
   - Taper abx per GI recs: see d/c instructions
   - Follow blood cultures
   # [**Hospital1 **] bleed?: ASA 81 was restarted 2 days ago, developed some red flecks
   and grossly heme positive reddish stool yesterday.

   - held Heparin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct checks, stable so far.
   - guaiac stools.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**10-30**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin, no further episodes.
   - monitor
   - continue amiodarone 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day.  Check dig level with am labs tomorrow.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.

   Currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs. TFs have been tolerated well.
   - replete lytes prn.
   - Ca and Mg repleated yesterday, 40mEq of KCl IV given this am.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection presenting with septic shock. He has shown improvement in his condition and is now normotensive with good urine output. His renal function is stable, as indicated by a creatinine level of 0.8.

The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to his previous C. diff colitis. There are no signs of a drug reaction or urinary tract infection. Blood and urine cultures are negative.

The patient continues to experience diarrhea but may have slightly improved. He has a distended abdomen and no tenderness. The plan is to taper antibiotics per GI recommendations.

The patient recently started taking aspirin (ASA) 81 mg, which resulted in some red flecks and grossly heme-positive reddish stool. This may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. The plan is to discontinue ASA and hold heparin. Hct checks will be done, and guaiac stools will be monitored.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A Fib with RVR) and has had two episodes. He was converted after receiving amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. He will continue on IV amiodarone and digoxin. The plan is to monitor his condition and follow up with a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with refractory C diff sepsis who is currently hemodynamically improving. He has profound weakness and nutritional deficiencies. His hypotension has resolved with hydration, and his mean arterial pressure (MAP) is now at 65. He is being treated with IV and oral Flagyl for C diff. His atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is being managed with digoxin, which has stabilized his heart rhythm in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), and he is undergoing a tapering dose of amiodarone. His Parkinson's disease medications are being continued. In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition through an impact with fiber at a rate of 65 mL/hour. His glycemic control is being monitored, and he has multiple lines including a PICC line. Prophylactic measures such as sc heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention are in place. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) / DNI (do not intubate), and his disposition is pending further discussion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has been resolved with hydration, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure that it does not recur.
2. C diff sepsis: The patient is being treated for C diff sepsis with IV and oral Flagyl"
