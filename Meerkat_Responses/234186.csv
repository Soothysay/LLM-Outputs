   Chief Complaint: cardiac arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - family update on likely poor prognosis, very reasonable about plans
   - plan to wait until the AM, warm him, allow his daughter to come and
   then reassess goals of care
   - EEG placed
   - neuro eval demosntrates likely anoxic myoclonus, unreactive 2 mm
   puplis, eyes skew, no response to cold calorics, no corneal reflexes,
   partial decerebrate postures with the leftmore than the right arm.
   - Propofol results in resolution of the twitching and the apparent
   sharp activity on EEG. : Prognosis is poor on the basis of the exam
   yesterday. I can't judge the exam reliably in the face of cooling.
   - dilantin loaded with IV and then PO
   - did not get echo as had to go down for head CT

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 85 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2143**]
   (SVG-LCx, LIMA-LAD), redo in [**2152**] (SVG>PDA) with AVR, constrictive
   pericarditis who presents from home after PEA arrest, taken emergently
   to cath lab and found to have distal LAD lesion treated with POBA.
   Etiology of PEA arrest remains unclear.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Reportedly in PEA arrest initially with conversion to
   VT after CPR.  Intubated in the ED.  He was started on amiodarone gtt
   in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  Differential for PEA arrest includes cardiac ischemia
   although grafts were patent, distal LAD disease treated with POBA vs
   pulmonary embolism vs heart failure vs primary electrical disease vs
   intracranial hemorrhage (reportedly normal mental status prior to
   arrest) vs tamponade.  There is no evidence for hypovolemia/bleeding,
   hyper/hypokalemia (K on arrival to ED was 4.0), medication overdoses,
   or trauma.  Acidosis was evident on arrival to ED, however may have
   been a result of arrest vs cause of. Patient was on Amiodarone drip
   post arrest. Patient s/p cooling protocol with Arctic sun.
   - d/c amio drip, consider starting oral amiodarone
   - Serial ABGs, goal CO2 35-40.
   - Continuous EEG monitoring to assess for status epilepticus once
   patient returns from CT scan - high incidence of status epilepticus in
   post arrest patients, using propofol
   - echocardiogram today
   - Pressors as needed to keep MAPs>65, now currently on dopamine as well
   as levo
   - Continue ASA.  Will continue plavix as reportedly had BMS x 2 in
   9/[**2156**].
   - Trend lactate.  5.1 on admission > 1.6.
   - Tight glycemic control.  Discussed with his outpatient
   endocrinologist who says patient does not do well on lantus.
   .
   # Neurologic function
 patient without corneal reflexes, no response
   to cold calorics, and no response to noxious stimuli. Neurology has
   been following given concern for anoxic brain injury. Does not appear
   to have brainstem reflexes.
   - appreciate neurology recs, suspect that will need to have meeting
   today with family with neurology present to risk stratify
   #. CAD s/p CABG ([**2143**], redo [**2152**]).  Cardiac catheterization today
   revealed distal LAD disease s/p POBA. Troponins uptrending still 0.78
   this morning. CK peaked at 1120 now downtrending.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   - hold BB given hypotension
   .
   #. Pump: Hemodynamics on catheterization not assessed on cath.
   - Echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   # Rhythm: s/p PEA arrest, converted to VT prior to ED arrival.  Now in
   atrial fibrillation on telemetry.
   - Not on coumadin at outpatient given history of frequent falls.
   - Continue to monitor closely on telemetry.
   .
   #. s/p AVR: Bioprosthetic valve
   - Evaluate aortic function with echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   # Constrictive pericarditis: Reportedly with h/o stripping.
   - Check echo in the AM.
   # DM, type 2: Discussed with outpatient endocrinologist.
   - Will give 10U NPH [**Hospital1 7**] for now.  FS QID
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Per outside records appears that baseline
   renal function is 1.5 which is where he is on admission.
   - Continue to monitor closely
   - Renally dose all medications.
   .
   #. FEN:
   - NPO for now.  Will place OG tube while intubated.
   - Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - Follow electrolytes and replete PRN.
   .
   #. Access:
   - Right femoral line
   - Right femoral Aline - will attempt to change overnight.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented to the hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient was initially in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and then converted to ventricular tachycardia (VT) before arriving at the emergency department. He was intubated and started on amiodarone drip post-arrest. The differential diagnosis for the PEA arrest includes cardiac ischemia, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, primary electrical disease, intracranial hemorrhage, and tamponade. There is no evidence of hypovolemia/bleeding, hyper/hypokalemia, medication overdoses, or trauma. Acidosis was evident on arrival to the ED, but it may have been a result of the arrest rather than the cause of it.

The patient underwent cooling with the Arctic sun and has shown some improvement. However, his neurologic function remains poor, with absent corneal reflexes, no response to cold calorics, and no response to noxious stimuli. The neurology team is following up on this concern for anoxic brain injury. The patient does not appear to have brainstem reflexes.

The patient's cardiac history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2143 and redo CABG in 2152. He also had an aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a bioprosthetic valve. The cardiac catheterization revealed distal left anterior descending (LAD) disease treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA). Troponins are uptrending, and the creatine kinase (CK) peaked at 1120 and is now downtrending.

The patient's rhythm is currently atrial fibrillation on telemetry, and he is not on coumadin at the outpatient level due to frequent falls. The patient's hemodynamics on the catheterization were not assessed, so an echocardiogram will be done in the morning.

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure with baseline renal function of 1.5, and constrictive pericarditis reportedly with a history of stripping. He is currently NPO and will have an orogastric tube placed while intubated. Nutrition will be considered for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) recommendations. Electrolytes will be closely monitored and repleted as needed.

The patient has right femoral line and right femoral arterial line access. Prophylaxis is being given for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to the CCU. The contact information for his daughter, granddaughter, grandson, and another person is provided.

In summary, the patient is an elderly male with a history of CAD and recent cardiac arrest. He is currently in atrial fibrillation and has poor neurologic function. His cardiac history includes CABG, AVR, and treatment of distal LAD disease. The patient also has diabetes, chronic renal failure, and constrictive pericarditis. He is receiving appropriate medical management, including pressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy. The potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of neurologic function, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and infection."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of cardiac artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and redo CABG. He presented from home after experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest (PEA) and was taken emergently to the cath lab. The distal LAD lesion was treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (POBA), and there is a concern for ventricular arrhythmia as the etiology of the arrest. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been cooled using the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. He is on IV amiodarone and will start oral amiodarone. Continuous EEG monitoring is being done to assess for status epilepticus, and propofol is being administered. The goal is to keep mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 65, and he is currently on dopamine as well as levo. 

Tight glycemic control is being maintained, and he is receiving ASA and Plavix due to his history of coronary artery disease. His neurologic function is severely impaired, with absent corneal reflexes, no response to cold calorics, and no response to noxious stimuli. An MRI of the head will be done to evaluate for anoxic brain injury.

The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed distal LAD disease treated with POBA, and his troponins are uptrending. He had a previous aortic valve replacement"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, including previous CABG surgery, who presented from home after experiencing a cardiac arrest. He was taken to the cath lab and found to have a distal LAD lesion that was treated with percutaneous intervention. The patient was in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest initially, but converted to ventricular tachycardia (VT) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism.

The patient has been undergoing cooling protocol with the Arctic Sun and has received an IV amiodarone load, followed by oral amiodarone. Continuous EEG monitoring is being performed to assess for status epilepticus, and propofol has been administered, with plans for further neuro evaluation. Pressors are being used to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 65, and dopamine has also been initiated. The patient is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and Plavix due to having two bare-metal stents in the past. Tight glycemic control is also being maintained.

Neurologically, the patient exhibits an absence of corneal reflexes, no response to cold calorics, and no response to noxious stimuli. Brainstem reflexes are not present, and there are concerns about anoxic brain injury. An MRI of the head is"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, including previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, redo CABG, aortic valve replacement (AVR), and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). He presented to the emergency department after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest at home. Initial treatment included emergent catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for distal left anterior descending (LAD) lesion, with concern for ventricular arrhythmia as the etiology of arrest.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple medical complications. His neurological function is severely impaired, with lack of corneal reflexes, no response to cold calorics, and no response to noxious stimuli. There is concern for anoxic brain injury, and an MRI of the head has been ordered to evaluate for this condition.

The patient's cardiac rhythm has transitioned from PEA arrest to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and now he is in atrial fibrillation (AF) on telemetry. He has a history of distal LAD disease treated with percutaneous orbital athectomy (POBA), and his CK peaked at 1120 but is now downtrending.

Hyperkalemia is present, with a potassium level of 5.9 this morning. Calcium, insulin, and kayexalate have been given, and repeat K is"

   24 Hour Events:
   - family update on likely poor prognosis, very reasonable about plans
   - plan to wait until the AM, warm him, allow his daughter to come and
   then reassess goals of care
   - EEG placed
   - neuro eval demosntrates likely anoxic myoclonus, unreactive 2 mm
   puplis, eyes skew, no response to cold calorics, no corneal reflexes,
   partial decerebrate postures with the leftmore than the right arm.
   - Propofol results in resolution of the twitching and the apparent
   sharp activity on EEG. : Prognosis is poor on the basis of the exam

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) disease treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA). The patient also has a history of atrioventricular valve replacement (AVR), constrictive pericarditis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's current condition includes being unresponsive, with no corneal reflexes, no response to cold calorics, and no response to noxious stimuli. The neurology team is following the patient's neurologic function due to concerns of anoxic brain injury. The patient's rhythm is currently atrial fibrillation on telemetry.

The patient's lab results show hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.9 this morning. The patient received calcium, insulin, and kayexalate to address this issue. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 93/49 to 132/68 mmHg, respiratory rate"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented from home after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was taken to the cath lab and found to have distal LAD lesion treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA). The differential diagnosis for the PEA arrest includes cardiac ischemia-induced arrhythmia due to distal LAD disease.

The patient's current medical conditions include acute renal failure (ARF), shock liver, and severe anoxic brain injury. The patient has been cooled using the Arctic sun cooling protocol and has completed an intravenous amiodarone load. Pressors are being used to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 65, and the patient is currently on dopamine and levophed.

Neurological function assessment shows that the patient lacks corneal reflexes, does not respond to cold calorics or noxious stimuli, and exhibits extensor posturing in response to deep pain. An MRI head has been held off for now, as per neurology recommendations, and the patient is being closely monitored for prognosis.

Hyperkalemia was observed with a potassium level of 5.9 this morning, which rose to 6.3. The patient received aggressive treatment with kayexalate, dextrose, insulin, and calcium gluconate to control the hyperkalemia. Renal function tests indicate acute-on-chronic renal failure, with baseline creatinine of 1.5 now trending up. Urine lytes are consistent with pre-renal acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

Elevated transaminases are consistent with shock liver, and hepatically metabolized medications are being avoided. The patient's cardiac history includes CAD status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2143**] and redo in [**2152**], as well as an aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a bioprosthetic valve. Cardiac catheterization revealed distal LAD disease treated with POBA.

Rhythm monitoring shows atrial fibrillation on telemetry, and the patient is not on coumadin due to frequent falls. The patient's diabetes type 2 has been discussed with an outpatient endocrinologist, and tight glycemic control is being maintained.

Access includes a right femoral line and right femoral arterial line, with plans to change the arterial line overnight. Pre-procedural instructions include PPI, bowel regimen, and heparin subcutaneous administration. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is critical care unit (CCU). Contact information for family members has been provided.

Overall, the patient is in critical condition with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was treated for a distal left anterior descending (LAD) lesion with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (POBA) and was found to have constrictive pericarditis. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and bioprosthetic valve replacement.

The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure (ARF), shock liver, severe anoxic brain injury, hyperkalemia, elevated transaminases, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's cardiac arrest was initially thought to be due to a primary arrhythmia, but it is now believed to be related to ischemia. The patient underwent a cooling protocol with the Arctic Sun and received IV amiodarone.

The patient's neurologic function has shown some improvement, but they remain non-responsive and only respond to deep pain with extensor posturing. There is ongoing concern for severe anoxic brain injury. The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by pre-renal acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and they have elevated creatinine levels. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes consistent with ""shock liver.""

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for distal left anterior descending (LAD) lesion. He also has a history of atrioventricular valve replacement (AVR), constrictive pericarditis, diabetes mellitus type 2, and severe anoxic brain injury.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/44 mmHg to 130/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on dopamine and levophed for blood pressure support.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, as he is nonresponsive with pathological reflexes and some midbrain function intact. He has been treated with dilantin for seizure activity. The patient's hyperkalemia has been managed with Kayexalate, calcium gluconate, and insulin.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with elevated creatinine levels and consistent findings of pre-renal acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There are also elevated liver enzymes indicative of ""shock liver.""

   pericarditis who presents from home after PEA arrest, taken emergently
   to cath lab and found to have distal LAD lesion treated with POBA,
   concern for ventricular arrhythmia as etiology of arrest. Now with ARF,
   shock liver and severe anoxic brain injury.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Reportedly in PEA arrest initially with conversion to
   VT after CPR.  Differential for PEA arrest includes cardiac ischemia
   induced arrhythmia
 L main vs distal LAD disease treated with POBA,
   CTA negative for PE.
   - Patient s/p cooling protocol with Arctic sun
   - Completed IV Amiodarone load
 will hold on po Amiodarone for now,
   likely VT in setting of ischemia and not primary arrhytmia
   - Serial ABGs, goal CO2 35-40.
   - Continuous EEG monitoring to assess for status epilepticus
f/u on
   final neuro read
   - Pressors as needed to keep MAPs>65, now currently on dopamine as well
   as levophed
   - Continue ASA.  Will continue plavix as reportedly had BMS x 2 in
   9/[**2156**].
   .
   # Neurologic function
 patient with initial lack of corneal reflexes,
   no response to cold calorics, and no response to noxious stimuli with
   evidence of seizure acitivity now improved on dilantin. Neurology has
   been following given concern for severe anoxic brain injury
 awaiting
   final recommendations following rewarming.
   - appreciate neurology recs, re-eval now s/p cooling
   - Consider MRI Head to eval for anoxic brain injury
   - Off all sedation now with no voluntary movements
   - Responds to deep pain with extensor posturing
   - Neuro will reassess today for prognosis and update family
   - Continue dilantin per Neuro
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 most likely related to ARF
   - K under control for now.
   - Continue to follow
   - Consider goal of care before proceeding to HD/CVVH
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.5 now trending up
   - Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal ATN
   - Renally dose all medications
   - Hold off on renal replacement for now
   .
   # Elevated transaminases: Consistent with shock liver.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Avoid hepatically metabolized medications
   .
   #. CAD s/p CABG ([**2143**], redo [**2152**]).  Cardiac catheterization today
   revealed distal LAD disease s/p POBA. CK peaked at 1120 now
   downtrending.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   - hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # Rhythm: s/p PEA arrest, converted to VT prior to ED arrival.  Now in
   atrial fibrillation on telemetry.
   - Not on coumadin at outpatient given history of frequent falls.
   - Continue to monitor closely on telemetry.
