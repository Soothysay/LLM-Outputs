 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 LARGE BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, INCLUDING VOLVULUS,
   ADHESIONS)
 .H/O CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), ISCHEMIC
   Assessment and Plan: 86 year old gentleman with history of CVA and
   seizures, DM2, hypertension initially admitted with seizure now POD#3
   partial sigmoid colectomy with course c/b fevers and leukocytosis now
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] after seizure and Iv ativan for airway management.
   .
   # Seizure: Pt initially admitted with seizure and has been followed by
   neurology on the floor who feel he has partial seizures which
   secondarily generalize in the setting of multiple prior infarcts and
   other medical issues including hypernatremia, sigmoid volvulus, fevers
   and infection. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been precipitated by flagyl dose this pm
   which can lower the seizure threshold. Patient noted to have witnessed
   seizure on the floor today (tonic clonic activity and hyperventilation,
   rigidity RUE) which resolved with IV ativan 2mg IV x 2. Currently, he
   is protecting his airway and ABG without hypercapnia or signs of
   respiratory failure. State head CT without acute process.
   - Discuss with surgery re second antiepileptic drug given seizure on
   dilantin (although slightly low drug level)
   - continue dilantin 100mg IV q8 with am phenytoin levels, goal 15-20
   - ativan prn
   - continuous O2 monitoring
   - seizure and aspiration precautions
   - appreciate neurology recommendations
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt hypotensive on arrival, likely secondary to med
   effect from labetalol and ativan as well as hypovolemia given rapid
   response to IVF. BP has since remained stable. Also concern for
   developing sepsis as below
   - continue to trend BP
   - IVF boluses prn maintain MAP>65, UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Patient having fevers to 101 on floor and
   leukocytosis of unclear etiology. Most likely a result of C diff
   colitis with sepsis ([**5-14**] SIRS critieria). Differential diagnosis
   includes catheter related bloodstream infection (PICC removed
   yesterday),  intraabdominal infection, post-op infection, Wound
   currently does not seem infected.
   - Continue metronidazole 800mg IV Q8H, vancomycin 500mg PO liquid Q6H
   - broad spectrum coverage for now- Vanco/Zosyn given ddx includes
   intraabdominal infection other than C diff
   - F/U and repeat blood cx and urine cx; F/U wound tip cx
   - LUE U/S given assymetric edema although had negative U/S as
   outpatient
   - NG Tube placement
   - repeat CXR in am with upper abdomen to confirm NG tube placement
   - consider CT abdomen/pelvis for further eval if pt does not improve
   with vanc/flagyl
   - tylenol prn fever
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Patient now tachycardic HR 100s likely secondary
   to dehydration, fever, holding recent PO meds (on 360mg PO dilt at
   home, on lopressor IV on floor since unable to tolerate PO)
   - Hold diltiazem and lopressor for now
   - IVF boluses PRN as above
   - tylenol prn fever
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.3 from 1.1, likley prerenal as above secondary to
   dehydration. has now received 2L NS.
   - continue to trend with IVF, monitor UOP
   - consider urine lytes if trends up
   .
   # Sigmoid volvulus: s/p colonoscopy and sigmoid colectomy, appreciate
   surgery recommendations
   - F/u surgery recs
   - Discuss with surgery re when to start NG nutrition
   .
   # DM2: Will continue home lantus 15 units qhs and HISS with FS QID
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: holding statin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO per speech and swallow eval on
   [**3-16**] who will re-eval in am

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old gentleman with a history of CVA and seizures. He was initially admitted for a seizure and underwent a partial sigmoid colectomy. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications since his admission.

1. Seizure: The patient initially presented with a seizure, which was believed to be partial seizures that secondarily generalize due to multiple prior infarcts, other medical issues, and hypernatremia. There was also a witnessed seizure on the floor, which resolved with IV ativan. The patient's airway is protected, and he is currently on continuous O2 monitoring.

Recommendations include discussing with surgery regarding the addition of a second antiepileptic drug, monitoring phenytoin levels, and continuing ativan as needed.

2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive on arrival, likely due to medication effects and hypovolemia. However, his blood pressure has stabilized with IVF boluses and remains stable. There is concern for developing sepsis.

Recommendations include trending BP, maintaining MAP >65, and ensuring adequate urine output.

3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis of unclear etiology. This is likely due to C diff colitis with sepsis. Differential diagnoses include catheter-related bloodstream infection, intraabdominal infection, and post-op infection.

Recommendations include continuing metronidazole and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension. He was initially admitted with a seizure and underwent partial sigmoid colectomy. The patient is now in the ICU and experiencing multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central Sleep Apnea (CSA): The patient has been diagnosed with CSA, which is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide retention.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently hypotensive. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure is required to prevent further complications.
3. Seizure: The patient has had recurrent seizures, which may be due to underlying neuro abnormalities, fever, infection, and dehydration. Seizure precautions should be continued, and antiepileptic medication should be administered as recommended by neurology.
4. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient is experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, indicating an infection. A broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated, and further investigations such as blood cultures, urine cultures, and imaging studies are planned to identify the source of infection.
5. Large Bowel Obstruction (LBO): The patient underwent sigmoid colectomy due to sigmoid volvulus. It is important to monitor for any signs of bowel obstruction or complications related to surgery.
6. Dehydration: The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old gentleman with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension. He was initially admitted with a seizure and is now in the ICU. He underwent partial sigmoid colectomy and is experiencing multiple complications, including central sleep apnea, hypertension, seizure, large bowel obstruction (intestinal obstruction, including volvulus, adhesions), C diff colitis, sinus tachycardia, and hypotension. He has been treated with various medications, including ativan, dilantin, phenytoin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have fevers and leukocytosis, which may be due to C diff colitis or another source of infection. He also has an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible dehydration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on antiepileptic drugs. It is important to monitor for any signs of seizure activity and adjust medication levels as necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection and determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but there is a concern for developing sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid status"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old gentleman with a history of CVA (stroke), seizures, DM2 (type 2 diabetes), and hypertension. He was initially admitted with a seizure and underwent partial sigmoid colectomy. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications since his admission.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given in the note are:

1. Central Sleep Apnea (CSA): The patient is already diagnosed with CSA, which is a sleep disorder characterized by interrupted breathing during sleep. It can lead to poor sleep quality and daytime drowsiness.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it is mentioned that his blood pressure remains stable after receiving IV fluids. It is important to monitor his blood pressure closely to prevent any complications related to high blood pressure.

3. Seizure: The patient initially presented with a seizure, and subsequent episodes have been observed. He has been prescribed antiepileptic medications such as lorazepam (Ativan) and phenytoin. Close monitoring for seizure activity and adherence to medication regimen are crucial to prevent further seizures.

4. Large Bowel Obstruction (LBO): The patient underwent a partial sigmoid colectomy due to sigmoid volvulus, which is a twisting of the sigmoid colon leading to bowel obstruction. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of recurrent obstruction or complications related to the surgery.

5. Infection: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of AMS, leukocytosis, and C. diff infection. He has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving IV antibiotics. His recent laboratory results show elevated WBC count, high CRP levels, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's condition is complicated by a history of stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. The patient's code status is set to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated CRP levels suggest an ongoing infection. The presence of C. diff infection increases the risk of complications such as sepsis and septic shock.
2. Cardiac complications: The elevated troponin levels indicate possible cardiac injury or ischemia. This could lead to heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
4. Stroke: The patient's history of stroke increases the risk of neurological complications, including increased intracranial pressure and seizures.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels may indicate poor glycemic control, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and altered mental status increase the"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old gentleman with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension. He was initially admitted with a seizure and now on POD#3 after partial sigmoid colectomy. The patient presents with AMS (altered mental status), leukocytosis, and cdiff (Clostridium difficile infection).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which indicates an infectious process. Additionally, he has a cdiff infection. There is a concern for other infectious processes, as indicated by the plan to follow up with a CXR (chest X-ray) to evaluate for possible pneumonia.

2. Renal impairment: The patient's creatinine level has risen from 1.1 to 1.3, suggesting a potential decline in kidney function. This may be due to prerenal causes such as dehydration, but further monitoring and management are required.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient exhibits dyspnea (shortness of breath) and alternating tachypnea and apnea. Bronchial breath sounds are noted on respiratory examination. These findings could indicate respiratory compromise or infection. A follow-up CXR is planned to further assess the respiratory status.

4. Cardiac concerns: The patient's heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) improved after receiving IV fluids (IVF), suggesting possible volume depletion."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension. He was initially admitted with a seizure and is now on POD#3 after a partial sigmoid colectomy. The patient has been experiencing fevers, leukocytosis, and a C. difficile infection.

The patient's current medical conditions include leukocytosis, AMS (altered mental status), cdiff (C. difficile infection), dyspnea (shortness of breath), tachycardia, seizure, altered mental status, central sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and a history of CVA (stroke).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7 F, blood pressure ranging from 154/46-69 to 74, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 31.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's imaging studies and microbiology results are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include continuing high-dose oral vancomycin, IV Flagyl, and holding tube feeds due to cdiff colitis. There is also a concern for another infectious process, so a follow-up chest X-ray is planned. The patient's leukocytosis is"

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the pre-existing gas
   distension of the small bowel loops, predominating in the left parts of
   the
   abdomen, has slightly increased. The sigmoid distension, on the other
   hand,
   has slightly decreased in extent. No free abdominal air. Unchanged
   position
   of nasogastric tube and vena cava filter, unchanged course of the left
   basal clips.
   CXR AP [**2186-3-18**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and
   support devices are unchanged. The lung volumes have decreased. As a
   result, the vascular structures are slightly crowded, notably at the
   lung bases. There is an apparent increase in diameter of the cardiac
   silhouette. However, no overt signs of pulmonary edema are present.
   Newly occurred blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the
   presence of a minimal left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
   Unremarkable hilar and mediastinal contours.
   LUE U/S [**2186-3-17**]:
   IMPRESSION: No left upper extremity DVT.
   EEG [**2186-3-17**]:
   IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due a slow and
   disorganized background rhythm, which was also of low voltage
   consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Medications,
   toxic/metabolic disturbances
   and infections are common causes. Anoxia is also a possible etiology.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension. He was initially admitted with a seizure and later underwent a partial sigmoid colectomy. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff, indicated by the presence of fever and leukocytosis. Treatment includes high-dose oral vancomycin, restart of tube feeds, and continuation of IV Flagyl.

2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests another infectious process, potentially a post-operative intrabdominal infection. Further investigation is needed.

3. Dyspnea (shortness of breath): The patient is experiencing alternating tachypnea and apnea, which may be due to a combination of central causes (multiple CVAs, seizures, toxic metabolic encephalopathy on EEG) and obstructive sleep apnea (large uvula, overweight status). Treatment includes repeating CXR, ABG, nasal trumpet, and BiPAP at night.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate improved after IV fluid administration. Close monitoring is necessary.

5. Seizure: Although the patient experienced a seizure, there was no seizure activity on the EEG. Dilantin therapy has been initiated to maintain levels above 15.

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a weight of 198 lbs. They are currently in the ICU due to a seizure episode. The patient has a history of encephalopathy, making them unable to provide their medical history. They have allergies to ace inhibitors and unknown allergens. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/43 to 103/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 26.5 mmHg, and they are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). They have reduced sigmoid distention and increased small bowel distention based on the imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which is a common cause of severe diarrhea and colitis, especially in hospitalized patients.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an immune response or infection.
3. Dyspnea: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath, which could be due to various factors such as pneumonia, fluid overload, or respiratory muscle weakness.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is above the normal range, which"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   86M CVAs, seizures, DM admit with confusion - found to be seizing,
   developed sigmoid volvulus s/p decompression / resection [**3-14**] - found
   febrile, seizing and hypertensive overnight, sent to ICU after
   developing hypotension in the setting of labetalol / ativan. C. diff +
   [**3-17**]. Febrile to 101.7 overnight. Remains on Vanc/ IV Flagyl/ PO

   - Probable ileus, keep NG at LWS, continue PO vanc/Flagyl for cdiff.
   - Leukocytosis likely d/t cdiff, but may have other source of infection
   - Apneic episodes yesterday may be med related, no recurrence of CSR
   today, possible OSA at baseline
   - Seizure ? related to Flagyl toixicity,  on phosfenytoin, with
   adjusted level 15-20 range based on serum albumin
   - DM, on insulin
   - Hypotension, hold antihypertensives
   - ARF, watch u/o, CVP, consider gentle hydration, would need NAC / HCO3
   prior to I+ CT if he decompensates

   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension.
- He was initially admitted with a seizure and later developed a sigmoid volvulus which required decompression and resection.
- The patient has been febrile, seizing, and hypertensive overnight, prompting transfer to the ICU.
- He was found to have Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) and is being treated with high-dose oral vancomycin, IV metronidazole, and IV piperacillin/tazobactam.
- The patient has leukocytosis, possibly due to another infectious process, and is being monitored closely.
- He also has dyspnea, alternating tachypnea and apnea, and very rhoncerous breath sounds.
- The patient's heart rate and blood pressure have improved after fluid resuscitation.
- He experienced a seizure but no continued seizure activity on EEG.
- His mental status is altered, possibly secondary to infection.
- The patient has central sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and a history of ischemic stroke.
- He received a sigmoid colectomy and is now on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- The patient's hyperlipidemia is being held due to statin use.
- ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension. He was initially admitted with a seizure and now on POD#3 after partial sigmoid colectomy. He has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis. The patient has multiple medical complications including c. difficile infection, leukocytosis, dyspnea, tachycardia, seizure, altered mental status, central sleep apnea, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and a history of stroke.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with c. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. It is important to continue treatment with high-dose oral vancomycin and restart tube feeds while monitoring the patient's abdominal exam.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infectious process. Further investigation is needed, including a follow-up chest X-ray and blood cultures, to identify the source of infection.
3. Dyspnea: The patient is experiencing alternating tachypnea and apnea. Central sleep apnea may be a contributing factor due to multiple CVAs, seizures, metabolic encephalopathy on EEG, and obstructive sleep apnea. Treatment options include repeating the chest X-ray, performing an ABG, using a nasal trumpet, and initiating BiPAP at night.
4. Tachycardia: The"

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the pre-existing gas
   distension of the small bowel loops, predominating in the left parts of
   the
   abdomen, has slightly increased. The sigmoid distension, on the other
   hand,
   has slightly decreased in extent. No free abdominal air. Unchanged
   position
   of nasogastric tube and vena cava filter, unchanged course of the left
   basal clips.
   CXR AP [**2186-3-18**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and
   support devices are unchanged. The lung volumes have decreased. As a
   result, the vascular structures are slightly crowded, notably at the
   lung bases. There is an apparent increase in diameter of the cardiac
   silhouette. However, no overt signs of pulmonary edema are present.
   Newly occurred blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the
   presence of a minimal left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
   Unremarkable hilar and mediastinal contours.
   LUE U/S [**2186-3-17**]:
   IMPRESSION: No left upper extremity DVT.
   EEG [**2186-3-17**]:
   IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due a slow and
   disorganized background rhythm, which was also of low voltage
   consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Medications,
   toxic/metabolic disturbances
   and infections are common causes. Anoxia is also a possible etiology.
   No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen during
   this recording.

   developed sigmoid volvulus s/p decompression / resection [**3-14**] - found
   febrile, seizing and hypertensive overnight, sent to ICU after

   Agree with plan to manage severe c. diff in patient s/p sigmoid

   - Probable ileus, keep NG at LWS, continue PO vanc/Flagyl for cdiff.
   - Leukocytosis likely d/t cdiff, but may have other source of infection
   - Apneic episodes yesterday may be med related, no recurrence of CSR
   today, possible OSA at baseline
   - Seizure ? related to Flagyl toixicity,  on phosfenytoin, with
   adjusted level 15-20 range based on serum albumin
   - DM, on insulin
   - Hypotension, hold antihypertensives
   - ARF, watch u/o, CVP, consider gentle hydration, would need NAC / HCO3

   - full for now. Remains full code but will continue to update family.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension. He was initially admitted with a seizure and later developed a sigmoid volvulus that required decompression and resection. The patient also has a C. difficile infection and is currently being treated with vancomycin (Vanc) IV and orally, as well as Zosyn.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Fever: The patient has been febrile overnight with a temperature of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 154/46 mmHg.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 96 beats per minute.
4. Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory rate is 21-39 breaths per minute with a saturation level of 100% on the face mask.
5. Altered mental status: The patient is barely arousable, opens eyes to verbal stimulus, and is not moving extremities, moaning, with coarse upper airway sounds. 
6. Reduced urine output: The patient's urine output is 20-30 cc/hr.
7. Positive C. difficile: The patient's stool sample tested positive for C. difficile.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is 32K, indicating an increased level of white blood cells.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVAs, seizures, and diabetes mellitus admitted with confusion. He developed sigmoid volvulus and underwent decompression/resection on [**3-14**]. The patient then became febrile, seizing, and hypertensive overnight and was sent to the ICU after developing hypotension in the setting of labetalol/ivan. The patient tested positive for C. diff on [**3-17**]. He remains on Vanc/IV Flagyl/PO vanc/Zosyn. Bilious residuals are present.

The patient's altered mental status/neurological condition is suspected to be due to a toxic metabolic event or an intraoperative event, most likely the latter. An EEG has been ordered, and the patient is on phenytoin with adjusted levels of 15-20 based on serum albumin. Seizure control is a concern, and the patient may be experiencing Flagyl toxicity.

The patient is also experiencing ileus with high residuals, and the NG tube is being kept at low wall suction. Antibiotics are being administered for C. diff, and leukocytosis and lactic acidosis are present. Respiratory issues, including probable sleep disordered breathing, are also noted, and BiPAP may be considered while in the ICU. The patient's diabetes mellitus requires insulin management. Acute renal failure (ARF) is a concern, and careful monitoring of urine output and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDiff). The patient is experiencing episodes of apnea, particularly at night, and is being treated with BiPAP. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and a previous stroke. 

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 119/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,466 mL and output of 1,400 mL, with a positive balance of 1,066 mL. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids and has been started on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.7 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin T levels. Imaging reveals a cardiac silhouette that is mildly enlarged and a new patchy area of alveolar opacification at the right lung base, which may be due to aspiration. Microbiology results are negative for any growth.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The presence of a patchy area of alveolar opacification at the right lung base suggests the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory distress and require further interventions such as broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. C. difficile colitis: The patient's diagnosis of C. difficile infection indicates the potential for worsening colitis. Close monitoring for symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and leukocytosis, is necessary. Fidoxamycin may be considered as a treatment option.

3. Seizure: The patient has experienced a seizure, and it is important to continue monitoring for recurrent seizures. Antiepileptic drugs may be considered to prevent further seizure episodes.

4. Central sleep apnea: The patient's episodes of apnea at night suggest central sleep apnea. BiPAP therapy may be helpful in managing this condition, but further evaluation with a sleep study may be required.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and appropriate antihypertensive medications may need to be considered to control blood pressure levels.

6. Diabetes management: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, hypertension, and sigmoid colectomy. He is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, CDiff infection, and dyspnea. The patient's leukocytosis is trending down, and he has aspiration on CXR. He is being treated for CDiff, sepsis, and obstructive sleep apnea. His blood glucose levels are high, and he has a history of type II diabetes. The patient's hypertension is benign, and he has a past history of stroke. His renal function is stable, but there may be some prerenal factors contributing to his condition. The patient also has hyperlipidemia and is restarting statin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has CDiff infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's dyspnea and alternating tachypnea and apnea may progress to respiratory distress, especially considering his large uvula and overweight status. Bipap at night and treating underlying processes like sepsis are recommended.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, which could be due to lactic acidosis or other metabolic disturbances"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, hypertension, and partial sigmoid colectomy for volvulus. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which is likely toxic-metabolic in nature. The patient also has episodes of apnea and tachypnea, and an ABG was normal. The patient has been diagnosed with CDifficile infection and is being treated with Vanc PO and IV Flagyl. The patient has leukocytosis, which is trending down, and there is suspicion of aspiration on CXR. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and they have a history of seizures and ischemic stroke. The patient's kidney function is stable, but there is concern for prerenal azotemia. The patient's electrolytes and other lab values are within normal range. The patient has been placed on TPN for nutrition and restarted on statin therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are currently on BiPAP at night.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and large uvula may increase the risk of aspiration, which is supported by the findings on the CXR showing a patchy area of alveolar opacification at the right lung base. Close monitoring and follow-up radiographs are recommended.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and an ongoing CDiff"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CVA, seizures, DM2, and hypertension. He underwent a partial sigmoid colectomy for volvulus and is currently in the ICU. The patient presents with altered mental status, dyspnea, tachycardia, and a seizure. He has a history of multiple CVAs, seizures, and toxic metabolic encephalopathy on EEG. The patient also has leukocytosis, C. difficile infection, hypertension, benign hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. difficile infection: The patient is already being treated with vancomycin and flagyl for the infection. Serial abdominal exams and KUB are recommended for monitoring.
2. Altered mental status: This could be due to toxic-metabolic causes. Dilantin has been continued, and the target level is being reduced to 15-20.
3. Apnea/Tachypnea: The patient is showing alternating tachypnea and apnea. Central sleep apnea is suspected due to multiple CVAs, seizures, and toxic metabolic encephalopathy. Bipap and CPAP for OSA are recommended, along with monitoring oxygen saturation levels.
4. Leukocytosis: It is trending down, and treatment for C. difficile is ongoing. Aspiration on CXR has been treated with 5 days of vancom"
