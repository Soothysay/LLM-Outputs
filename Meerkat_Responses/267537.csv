","The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse/withdrawal, cirrhosis, who presents with alcohol withdrawal and fevers. She required intubation for airway protection and is currently sedated on versed/fentanyl for sedation. The plan is to continue the sedation and gradually wean off versed starting in the morning to assess function.

The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin levels and an increased INR. The cause of the elevated bilirubin is unclear, but it may be related to cirrhosis. The patient also has a macrocytic anemia, which could be due to alcohol abuse, B12/folate deficiency, or GI bleed. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.

The patient's fevers may be due to a urinary tract infection, as indicated by the positive urine analysis. Cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been started.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, and is currently showing signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines will be continued for withdrawal management.

The patient's nutritional status needs to be assessed, as she is NPO (nothing by mouth) at the moment. Repletion of fluids will be done through intravenous fluids.

The patient's next of kin is somewhat unclear, with sisters involved but the patient's parents and child's whereabouts unknown. The doctor's name is also unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise include"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse/withdrawal, cirrhosis.
- She presents with alcohol withdrawal symptoms and fevers.
- The patient required intubation for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- She is sedated with versed/fentanyl and receiving folate/thiamine/MVI.
- She has macrocytic anemia, likely due to alcohol-related bone marrow suppression or nutritional deficiencies.
- The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting possible hepatic involvement.
- She has conjunctivitis, which is likely viral but cannot be ruled out as bacterial.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient has a significant history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. She may develop complications such as seizures or delirium tremens if not appropriately managed.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and positive urine analysis suggest a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Cultures are pending, and she is being treated with ciprofloxacin. Other sources of infection should also be considered and ruled out.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and elevated bilirubin levels, hepatic encephalopathy is a possibility. This condition can cause altered mental status"

   fevers
   Plan:
   # ETOH withdrawal/Cirrhosis: patient with significant ETOH history; has
   h/o withdrawal.  no seizures.  Received large amount of valium in ED
   for CIWA>20.  Eventually required intubation for airway protection.
   Started on versed/fentanyl for sedation
   - cont versed/fentanyl for now; benzos for ETOH withdrawal
   - will slowly wean down on versed starting in AM to assess function.
   - trend LFTs
   - call PCPs office for records- ? varices. guaiac all stools
   - check hep panel
   - SW consult once awake
   - folate/thiamine/MVI
   # AMS: likely in the setting of ETOH withdrawal and benzos.  Requiring
   intubation.  Could also be encephalopathy.  Also, infection with + UA.
   tox screen otherwise negative
   - will keep intubated for now while withdrawing.  Consider decreasing
   sedation and re-evaluate
   - lactulose TID; no asterixis noted on exam
   - treat infection as below
   - no PV thrombosis to be concerned for acute LFT abnormality
   # Fevers: source so far likely urine with +UA.  Cultures pending. CXR
   negative.  no ascites to be concerned for SBP.  LFTs elevated; but no
   e/o cholecystitis or cholangitis.
   - monitor fever curve
   - cont vanco/cipro for now
   - sputum culture if spikes
   - check hepatitis panel
   - consider HIV when awake
   # Macrocytic Anemia: unclear etiology; could be GI bleed, other causes
   are B12/Folate def or ETOH BM suppresion; could be iron def.
   - check b12/folate, check iron studies
   - guaiac all stools
   - T&S; tx for HCT<21

   41 yo female with history of ETOH abuse/Benzo abuse who presented to
   PCP yesterday with symptoms of withdrawl and no EtOH consumption for
   >12 hours.  Patient to ED and patient given Valium 100mg and with
   increased sedation patient with inability to maintain adequate airway
   patency patient intubated and transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further care.
   Importantly patient has possible history of cirrhosis noted in the
   outside records.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Patient with altered mental status in the
   setting of likely EtOH withdrawl which may well be in the setting of
   underlying cirrhosis which may complicate establishment of baseline
   mental status with high dose benzodiazepines.
   -Move to PSV
12/5 to keep Ve-[**10-16**],  and RR-16
   -Wean sedation
   -Lactulose
   -Will look to wean sedation today as primary insult does apppear to be
   altered mental status as primary issue
she does have mild RLL
   infiltrate evolving following intubation
   2)EtOH Abuse/ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS,
   SEIZURES)-
   -Thiamine/Flote/B12
   -Wean Fentanyl to off
   -Versed to continue as background medication during wean
   -Will check Amonia for possible evidence to suggest hepatic
   encephaolopathy
   -Replete K+
   3)Anemia-Is with significant anemia
present at admission
is with
   macrocytosis
   -Will check B12/Folate and is likely EtOH related
they have returned
   today as normal of note
   -OB stool
   -1 unit PRBC today
   4)Aspiration Pneumonitis/Urinary Tract Infection-
   -Vanco/Cipro in place
for possible RML infiltrate and urinary tract
   infection
   -Follow up sputum culture if obtained but is most likely aspiration
   pneumonitis
   5)Transaminitis-Possibly EtOH hepatitis but patient with strong
   findings of cirrhosis and in the absence of EtOH patient may likely
   have cirrhosis plus modest elevations in TA
   -INR ressuring for preserved hepatic synthetic function but albumin is
   2.4--trace ascites only
   -Significant elevation in bilirubin and modest elevation in
   transaminitis arguing against toxic or ischemic insult
   -Hep pannel sent, follow transaminases
   -Continue Lactulose
   -Will need OSH  records from [**Hospital1 966**]

","The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and benzodiazepine abuse. She presented to the primary care physician with symptoms of withdrawal and had not consumed any alcohol for more than 12 hours. The patient was given Valium 100mg and experienced increased sedation, leading to an inability to maintain adequate airway patency. As a result, the patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further care.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, possible history of cirrhosis, altered mental status, and suspected alcohol withdrawal. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, with a heart rate slightly elevated. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 101.2°F.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, cirrhosis of the liver, and recent fevers. She presented with alcohol withdrawal and required intubation for airway protection due to altered mental status (AMS). The patient's condition has improved, and she has been extubated. She continues to be monitored for potential complications such as infections, liver dysfunction, and macrocytic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a positive urine analysis indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotic treatment has been initiated, and cultures are being monitored.
2. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels and elevated liver enzymes suggest possible liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and extent of liver damage.
3. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia with an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The etiology of this anemia is unclear but may be related to alcohol use, nutritional deficiencies, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Esophageal Varices: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which puts her at risk for esophageal varices. Prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been prescribed, and stool guaiac testing will be performed to monitor for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Delirium Tremens (DTs): Although the patient has been extubated, there"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, cirrhosis, who presents with alcohol withdrawal symptoms, fevers, and altered mental status (AMS). The patient required intubation for airway protection due to severe AMS and was started on versed/fentanyl for sedation. The plan is to wean off versed/fentanyl and transition to CIWA scale with Valium. A social work consult has been requested for safety concerns regarding the patient's live-in boyfriend.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal coagulation profile (INR). The patient is being treated for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) with Ciprofloxacin and lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient's macrocytic anemia etiology is unclear, but it could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes. The patient's folate and B12 levels are normal, and iron levels are also within normal range. The patient's conjunctivitis is likely viral, and treatment with artificial tears and erythromycin ointment has been prescribed.

The patient's nutritional status is being addressed with full liquids, and glycemic control is well maintained. The patient has multiple lines inserted for access and fluid repletion. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ul"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted for ethanol withdrawal and agitation. She required brief ventilatory support due to her condition. The patient was given lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy and experienced rapid high-volume stool output. The patient's respiratory failure was successfully managed without any complications after being extubated. She also has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, which may require further clarification. Other assessments include urinary tract infection and potential alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens, seizures, and agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required ventilatory support, indicating a potential risk of respiratory failure. However, she was successfully extubated without event.
2. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as liver dysfunction, portal hypertension, and increased risk of infections.
3. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts her at risk for withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens, seizures, and agitation. Proper management with medications like thiamine, vitamin B12, and Valium will be crucial to prevent these complications.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient was given lactulose, suggesting a suspicion of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.
5. Urinary tract"

   Assessment: This is a 41 year-old female with a history of ETOH
   abuse/ETOH withdrawal, cirrhosis who presents with ETOH withdrawal and
   fevers
    Plan:
   # ETOH withdrawal: patient with significant ETOH history; has h/o
   withdrawal.  no seizures.  Received large amount of valium in ED for
   CIWAs>20.  Eventually required intubation [**3-12**] for airway protection.
   Extubated [**3-13**]
   - CIWA Q 2hrs for now- is requiring 20mg Valium Q 2hrs at this time for
   CIWA
s around 13
   - SW on board
   - folate/thiamine/MVI PO
   # AMS: likely in the setting of ETOH withdrawal and benzos.  Requiring
   intubation.  Unlikely  hepatic encephalopathy.  Also, infection with +
   UA. tox screen otherwise negative, no other evident sources of infxn-
   minimal ascites so unlikely SBP, no PNA on CXR.
   - treat UTI with Bactrim
   -Monitor MS
   # Fevers: source so far likely urine with +UA.  Cultures show E coli
   resistant to Cipro so swiched to Bactrim. CXR negative but now Sputum
   from [**3-13**] with GPC in pairs. CXR largely unchanged.  no ascites to be
   concerned for SBP.  LFTs elevated; but no e/o cholecystitis or
   cholangitis.  Hep panel neg but Hep B vaccinated. Pt with fever, chills
   today could be [**3-10**] GPC in lungs or withdrawl (? Withdrawl from opiates
   with tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, diarrhea, anxiety)
   - monitor fever curve
   - Bactrim for UTI
   - f/u cultures
   -Restart Vanco for GPCs in sputum
   - consider HIV test
   -send C diff
   -Rechk serum and urine tox this afternoon- nursing ? if visitor may
   have given something to pt this afternoon
   # Cirrhosis: unclear on complications (per pt) but BIli elevated at 10
   on admission. INR 1.4 . Cr 0.7. ? etiology- likely EtOH as hepatitis
   panel neg.  Also originally ? acute alcoholic hepatitis as well.
   Discriminant fx on admission 16 so no need for steroids today.
   - trend LFTs
   - give PPI for vague hx per pt of esophageal varices
   - guaiac all stools
   # Macrocytic Anemia: unclear etiology; could be GI bleed, other causes
   are B12/Folate def or ETOH BM suppresion; could be iron def. However,
   folate and B12 nl levels.  Iron nl and ferritin up so unlikely iron
   deficiency. Most likely ETOH. Bumped appropriately to 2 u PRBCs [**3-12**].
   Hct stable today at 28
   - guaiac all stools- currently neg but does have sign liquidy diarrhea
   - T&S active

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and elevated liver function tests (LFTs), there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring mental status and checking ammonia levels would be important.

2. Infection: The patient has fevers and a positive urine analysis (UA) with E. coli resistant to ciprofloxacin. This indicates a urinary tract infection (UTI), and appropriate treatment with Bactrim has been initiated. The presence of GPCs in the sputum also suggests a respiratory infection, for which vancomycin has been restarted.

3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient has minimal ascites, SBP should still be considered due to the fever and elevated white blood cell count (WBC). Monitoring the patient's symptoms and considering paracentesis if necessary would be important.

4. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: The patient has a significant history of alcohol withdrawal, which puts them at risk for seizures. Continuous monitoring and administering diazepam as needed are essential.

5. Macrocytic anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia with a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and macro-ovalocytes on peripheral smear. The et"

   abuse/ETOH withdrawal, cirrhosis who presents with ETOH withdrawal and
   fevers
    Plan:
   # ETOH withdrawal: patient with significant ETOH history; has h/o
   withdrawal.  no seizures.  Received large amount of valium in ED for
   CIWAs>20.  Eventually required intubation [**3-12**] for airway protection.
   Extubated [**3-13**]
   - CIWA Q 2hrs for now
   - SW on board
   - folate/thiamine/MVI PO
   # AMS: likely in the setting of ETOH withdrawal and benzos.  Requiring
   intubation.  Unlikely  hepatic encephalopathy.  Also, infection with +
   UA. tox screen otherwise negative, no other evident sources of infxn-
   minimal ascites so unlikely SBP, no PNA on CXR.
   -D/C lactulose given sign large amts diarrhea overnight
   - treat UTI with Bactrim
   # Fevers: source so far likely urine with +UA.  Cultures show E coli
   resistant to Cipro so swiched to Bactrim. CXR negative.  no ascites to
   be concerned for SBP.  LFTs elevated; but no e/o cholecystitis or
   cholangitis.  Hep panel neg but Hep B vaccinated
   - monitor fever curve
   - Bactrim for UTI
   - f/u cultures
   - consider HIV test
   # Cirrhosis: unclear on complications (per pt) but BIli elevated at 10
   on admission. INR 1.4 . Cr 0.7. ? etiology- likely EtOH as hepatitis
   panel neg.  Also originally ? acute alcoholic hepatitis as well.
   Discriminant fx on admission 16 so no need for steroids today.
   - trend LFTs
   - give PPI for vague hx per pt of esophageal varices
   - guaiac all stools
   # Macrocytic Anemia: unclear etiology; could be GI bleed, other causes
   are B12/Folate def or ETOH BM suppresion; could be iron def. However,
   folate and B12 nl levels.  Iron nl and ferritin up so unlikely iron
   deficiency. Most likely ETOH. Bumped appropriately to 2 u PRBCs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, and withdrawal symptoms. The patient was admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to altered mental status (AMS) and was intubated. She has since been extubated and is now on continuous IV diazepam for withdrawal symptoms.

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens and seizures), and fevers. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin. The UTI is being treated with Bactrim.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 124/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, with no cyanosis or jugular venous distention noted. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Neurological examination reveals purposeful movements and normal tone.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels, decreased albumin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes continuing CIWA-Q2HR for alcohol withdrawal, monitoring for"

The patient is currently managed with Valium for altered mental status and has been tried on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, which resulted in diarrhea. She is also being treated for a urinary tract infection with Bactrim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and ongoing delirium, which could indicate hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can worsen if lactulose is not properly managed.
2. Diarrhea: The patient experienced diarrhea after being given lactulose, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient is showing signs of withdrawal from EtOH, including agitation and hallucinations. DTs can occur during alcohol withdrawal and can be life-threatening.
4. Respiratory failure: Although the patient was successfully extubated, she initially required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Monitoring her respiratory status is crucial to prevent any potential complications.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is being treated for a UTI with Bactrim. If left untreated, a UTI can lead"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of EtOH withdrawal. The patient has been persistently agitated with CIWAs to 15 Q 2 hours with Valium 20mg PO Q 2 during the day, requiring 1:1 staffing. Haldol 2 IV was given in addition to 5 Valium IV around 6 p.m. for control of agitation. Nursing is concerned that the patient may have been brought substances in the afternoon. The serum tox screen was negative, but urine tox is still pending. The patient is experiencing symptoms of fever, tachycardia, agitation, and diarrhea, which could be indicative of possible opioid withdrawal. The plan is to give IV Dilaudid overnight if symptoms persist, particularly agitation.

The patient has also started loperamide PRN for diarrhea. Stool has been sent for C. difficile testing. Neutraphos 2 pkt TID has been started for phosphate replacement. Potassium and magnesium have been repleted. The patient received a bolus of 1L due to diarrhea and tachycardia in the afternoon. An order has been placed for Hep A IgM due to elevated LFTs and diarrhea. Vancomycin was restarted with sputum culture from [**3-13**]. The patient continues to be febrile during the day.

 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 .H/O ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment: This is a 41 year-old female with a history of ETOH
   abuse/ETOH withdrawal, cirrhosis who presents with ETOH withdrawal and
   fevers
    Plan:
   # ETOH withdrawal: patient with significant ETOH history; has h/o
   withdrawal.  no seizures.  Received large amount of valium in ED for
   CIWAs>20.  Eventually required intubation [**3-12**] for airway protection.
   Extubated [**3-13**]
   - CIWA Q 2hrs for now- is requiring 20mg Valium Q 2hrs at this time for
   CIWA
s around 13
   - SW on board
   - folate/thiamine/MVI PO
   # AMS: likely in the setting of ETOH withdrawal and benzos.  Requiring
   intubation.  Unlikely  hepatic encephalopathy.  Also, infection with +
   UA. tox screen otherwise negative, no other evident sources of infxn-
   minimal ascites so unlikely SBP, no PNA on CXR.
   - treat UTI with Bactrim
   -Monitor MS
   # Fevers: source so far likely urine with +UA.  Cultures show E coli
   resistant to Cipro so swiched to Bactrim. CXR negative but now Sputum
   from [**3-13**] with GPC in pairs. CXR largely unchanged.  no ascites to be
   concerned for SBP.  LFTs elevated; but no e/o cholecystitis or
   cholangitis.  Hep panel neg but Hep B vaccinated. Pt with fever, chills
   today could be [**3-10**] GPC in lungs or withdrawl (? Withdrawl from opiates
   with tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, diarrhea, anxiety)
   - monitor fever curve
   - Bactrim for UTI
   - f/u cultures
   -Restart Vanco for GPCs in sputum
   - consider HIV test
   -send C diff
   -Rechk serum and urine tox this afternoon- nursing ? if visitor may
   have given something to pt this afternoon
   # Cirrhosis: unclear on complications (per pt) but BIli elevated at 10
   on admission. INR 1.4 . Cr 0.7. ? etiology- likely EtOH as hepatitis
   panel neg.  Also originally ? acute alcoholic hepatitis as well.
   Discriminant fx on admission 16 so no need for steroids today.
   - trend LFTs
   - give PPI for vague hx per pt of esophageal varices
   - guaiac all stools
   # Macrocytic Anemia: unclear etiology; could be GI bleed, other causes
   are B12/Folate def or ETOH BM suppresion; could be iron def. However,

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. She presents with alcohol withdrawal symptoms, fevers, tachycardia, agitation, diarrhea, and possible opioid withdrawal. She has been treated with Valium and Haldol for agitation, and Loperamide for diarrhea. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and she has anemia with an unknown etiology. She has been started on Bactrim for the UTI, Restarted Vancomycin for Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the sputum, and PPI for suspected esophageal varices. The patient's current condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and further evaluation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to her history of cirrhosis, the patient is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can lead to seizures, and the patient's history of alcohol abuse puts her at an increased risk.
3. Infection: The patient has already shown signs of infection with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat any potential infections.
4. Bleeding: Esophageal varices are a"

   Assessment: This is a 41 year-old female with a history of ETOH
   abuse/ETOH withdrawal, cirrhosis who presents with ETOH withdrawal and
   fevers
    Plan:
   # ETOH withdrawal: patient with significant ETOH history; has h/o
   withdrawal.  no seizures.  Received large amount of valium in ED for
   CIWAs>20.  Eventually required intubation [**3-12**] for airway protection.
   Extubated [**3-13**]. Now appears benzo intoxicated.
   - decr CIWA to Q 4hrs 5-10mg PO for now
   - SW on board
   - folate/thiamine/MVI PO
   # AMS: likely in the setting of ETOH withdrawal and benzos.  Requiring
   intubation.  Unlikely  hepatic encephalopathy.  Also, infection with +
   UA. tox screen otherwise negative, no other evident sources of infxn-
   minimal ascites so unlikely SBP, no PNA on CXR.
   - treat UTI with Bactrim
   -Monitor MS
   # Fevers: source so far likely urine with +UA.  Cultures show E coli
   resistant to Cipro so swiched to Bactrim. CXR negative but now Sputum
   from [**3-13**] with GPC in pairs. CXR largely unchanged.  no ascites to be
   concerned for SBP.  LFTs elevated; but no e/o cholecystitis or
   cholangitis.  Hep panel neg but Hep B vaccinated. Pt with fever, chills
   today could be [**3-10**] GPC in lungs or withdrawl (? Withdrawl from opiates
   with tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, diarrhea, anxiety)
   - monitor fever curve
   - Bactrim for UTI
   - f/u cultures
   -Restart Vanco for GPCs in sputum
   - consider HIV test
   -send C diff
   -Rechk serum and urine tox this afternoon- nursing ? if visitor may
   have given something to pt this afternoon
   # Cirrhosis: unclear on complications (per pt) but BIli elevated at 10
   on admission. INR 1.4 . Cr 0.7. ? etiology- likely EtOH as hepatitis
   panel neg.  Also originally ? acute alcoholic hepatitis as well.
   Discriminant fx on admission 16 so no need for steroids today.
   - trend LFTs
   - give PPI for vague hx per pt of esophageal varices
   - guaiac all stools
   # Macrocytic Anemia: unclear etiology; could be GI bleed, other causes
   are B12/Folate def or ETOH BM suppresion; could be iron def. However,
   folate and B12 nl levels.  Iron nl and ferritin up so unlikely iron
   deficiency. Most likely ETOH. Bumped appropriately to 2 u PRBCs [**3-12**].
   Hct stable today at 28
   - guaiac all stools- currently neg but does have sign liquidy diarrhea

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, fever, tachycardia, agitation, and diarrhea. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and macrocytic anemia. The patient requires close monitoring and treatment for her various conditions, including alcohol withdrawal, UTI, pneumonia, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal and may be at risk for seizures.
2. Infection: The patient has a UTI and pneumonia, both of which require treatment. There is also a concern for potential infections such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and Hepatitis B.
3. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis may progress to liver failure, leading to complications like hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
4. GI bleeding: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly from esophageal varices.
5. Malnutrition: The patient may be at risk for malnutrition due to poor dietary intake and chronic illness.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has central venous catheters, which increase the risk of DVT.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 .H/O ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment: This is a 41 year-old female with a history of ETOH
   abuse/ETOH withdrawal, cirrhosis who presents with ETOH withdrawal and
   fevers
    Plan:
   # ETOH withdrawal: patient with significant ETOH history; has h/o
   withdrawal.  no seizures.  Received large amount of valium in ED for
   CIWAs>20.  Eventually required intubation [**3-12**] for airway protection.
   Extubated [**3-13**]. Now appears benzo intoxicated.
   - decr CIWA to Q 4hrs 5-10mg PO for now
   - SW on board
   - folate/thiamine/MVI PO
   -recheck pm lytes (has needed aggressive repletion)
   # AMS: likely in the setting of ETOH withdrawal and benzos.  Requiring
   intubation.  Unlikely  hepatic encephalopathy.  Also, infection with +
   UA. tox screen otherwise negative, no other evident sources of infxn-
   minimal ascites so unlikely SBP, no PNA on CXR.
   - treat UTI with Bactrim , GPC on sputum with vanco
   -Monitor MS
   - Of note, Haldol 2mg IV worked very well overnight for agitation
   # Fevers: source so far likely urine with +UA.  Cultures show E coli
   resistant to Cipro so swiched to Bactrim. CXR negative but now Sputum
   from [**3-13**] with GPC in pairs. CXR largely unchanged.  no ascites to be
   concerned for SBP.  LFTs elevated; but no e/o cholecystitis or
   cholangitis.  Hep panel neg but Hep B vaccinated. Pt with fever, chills
   [**3-15**] could be [**3-10**] GPC in lungs or withdrawl (? Withdrawl from opiates
   with tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, diarrhea, anxiety). Of note: serum
   and urine tox overnight [**3-15**] was negative.  C diff also neg [**3-15**]
   - monitor fever curve
   - Bactrim for UTI , Vanco for GPCs in sputum
   - f/u cultures
   - consider HIV test
   # Cirrhosis: unclear on complications (per pt) but BIli elevated at 10
   on admission. INR 1.4 . Cr 0.7. ? etiology- likely EtOH as hepatitis
   panel neg.  Also originally ? acute alcoholic hepatitis as well.
   Discriminant fx on admission 16 so no need for steroids today.
   - trend LFTs
   - give PPI for vague hx per pt of esophageal varices
   - guaiac all stools
   -f/u Hep A IgM
   # Macrocytic Anemia: unclear etiology; could be GI bleed, other causes
   are B12/Folate def or ETOH BM suppresion; could be iron def. However,
   folate and B12 nl levels.  Iron nl and ferritin up so unlikely iron
   deficiency. Most likely ETOH. Bumped appropriately to 2 u PRBCs [**3-12**].
   Hct stable today at 26
   - guaiac all stools- currently neg but does have sign liquidy diarrhea
   - T&S active
   # Conjuctivitis: likely viral; but cannot r/o bacterial. significant
   injection and crusting
   - artificial tears QID
   - erthyromycin ointment QID x 5 days
   # Access: 2 18G, 1 16G
   # PPx: hep sc, PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, cirrhosis, and pneumonia. She presented with alcohol withdrawal symptoms and fevers. The patient required intubation for airway protection but was extubated on 3/13. She appears to be benzodiazepine-intoxicated and has been receiving Valium for CIWA scores. She has a history of AMS (altered mental status) likely due to alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine use, as well as a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive urine analysis but negative serum and urine toxicology screens. The patient's fever could be attributed to a urinary tract infection or withdrawal symptoms. She has elevated liver function tests and hepatitis B immunity. The patient also has macrocytic anemia, which may be related to alcohol use. She is currently being treated with Bactrim for UTI and Vancomycin for GPCs in her sputum. Monitoring for fever curve, trends in liver function tests, and follow-up cultures are planned. Consideration is being given to HIV testing and a hepatitis A IgM test."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo female admit with EtOH abuse and withdrawl.  She now has
   persitent intermittent agitation and has had greatest response to
   Haldol with trials made. She has diarrhea persisting. but minimal
   concern for C. Diff.  This has been presumed to be related to withdrawl
   but any of the syndromes likely EtOH/narcotic withdrawl would be
   expected to be improving or stabilized at this point in her treatment
   course.  She retains a neurologic exam without a focal deficit and has
   had Thiamine replacement from the time of admission.  She does have UTI
   and pulmonary infection contributing to ongoing delirium, but again,
   minimal change to improvement.  She does have persistent low grade
   fevers with minimal evidence of persistent pulmonary infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted with a history of EtOH abuse and withdrawal. She has persistent intermittent agitation, greatest response to Haldol, diarrhea, and minimal concern for C. Diff. The patient has ongoing delirium due to UTI and pulmonary infection. She also has low-grade fevers, minimal infiltrate on CXR, and a history of alcohol withdrawal including delirium tremens (DTs), seizures, cirrhosis of the liver, and possible primary pathology driving persistent altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium Tremens (DTs): A severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes. Symptoms may include severe agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and seizures.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
3. Infection: The patient has ongoing delirium due to UTI and pulmonary infection. These infections need to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis of the liver, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition where toxins build up in the bloodstream and affect brain function. Symptoms may include confusion, disorientation, and personality changes.
5. Diarrhea: The patient has persistent diarrhea, which could be due to alcohol abuse, medication side effects, or an underlying infection. Monitoring fluid"
