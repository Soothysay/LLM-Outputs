   Imaging: Very limited examination without IV contrast (due to the
   patient's renal insufficiency), with:
   1. L4-5: Multifactorial right neural foraminal and subarticular zone
   stenosis with likely impingement upon the right exiting L4 and
   traversing L5
   nerve roots with moderate overall canal stenosis at this level.
   2. L5-S1: Combination of congenitally abnormal canal geometry with
   prominent
   epidural lipomatosis, as well as facet arthrosis, results in severe
   relative
   canal stenosis with compression of the thecal sac; there is also left
   neural
   foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left L5
   nerve
   root.
   3. No specific finding on the STIR sequence, evidence of endplate or
   disc
   destruction or epidural or paraspinal fluid collection to specifically

   ECG: ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Suboptimal image image qaulity
   prohibits adequate visualization of the distal LV/apex - however the
   apex (apical lateral) appears hypokinetic in some views. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible apical hypokinesis. If
   clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may assist in
   better defining regional LV systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema:
   Combination of demand ischemia in setting of hypertension, possible
   component of aortic stenosis.
   - Largely improved; will largely run even
   - NTG gtt, wean off today
   #. Fevers:
   Cultures yesterday and at the outside hospital are growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. Overall
   picture is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary
   discitis/abscess that has not been identified.
   - TEE today to look for valvular vegatations
   - consider tagged WBC scan since gadolinium is not ideal.
   - f/u speciation
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone.
   # NSTEMI
   - likely demand ischemia in setting of hypertension/tachycardia, less
   likely distal LAD. No associated ECG changes
   Enzymes now trending down
   - daily asa
   - continue heparin for 24h, discontinuing this afternoon
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - start high dose statin
   #. Lower back pain: In the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute
   onset lower back pain, we remain suspicious of an epidural abscess or
   discitis.
   - w/u as above.
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to volume
   depletion and pain. Improved with fluids and pain control.
   -Continue morphine prn pain
   #. Renal failure: Was being worked up at OSH for
   paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike.
   - repeat SPEP
   - baseline is now likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new
   baseline.
   .
   #. EKG changes: Patient with lateral ST depressions in V4-V6 with no
   baseline to compare to. Likely represnts demand ischemia in the setting
   of tachycardia. Will check as set of cardiac enzymes, and repeat EKG
   when tachycardia under better control.
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   -Will add on iron studies
   -Guiac stools
   - active T&S
   -Obtain records for baseline
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF, primary team to
   confirm home regimen in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress transferred to the ICU. The patient was diagnosed with NSTEMI, and demand ischemia is suspected. He has been treated with heparin, beta-blocker, and aspirin. The patient also has an enlarged prostate and underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) two years ago. He has a history of gout and asthma. The patient's urine culture showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. The echocardiogram revealed mild aortic regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation but no vegetations. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Streptococcal endovascular infection or primary discitis/abscess: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis, along with acute onset lower back pain, raise suspicion for an epidural abscess or discitis. Further evaluation with a tagged WBC scan or repeat echocardiogram may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient presented with respiratory distress and flash pulmonary edema, likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension and possible component of aortic stenosis.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a"

   Imaging: Very limited examination without IV contrast (due to the
   patient's renal insufficiency), with:
   1. L4-5: Multifactorial right neural foraminal and subarticular zone
   stenosis with likely impingement upon the right exiting L4 and
   traversing L5
   nerve roots with moderate overall canal stenosis at this level.
   2. L5-S1: Combination of congenitally abnormal canal geometry with
   prominent
   epidural lipomatosis, as well as facet arthrosis, results in severe
   relative
   canal stenosis with compression of the thecal sac; there is also left
   neural
   foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left L5
   nerve
   root.
   3. No specific finding on the STIR sequence, evidence of endplate or
   disc
   destruction or epidural or paraspinal fluid collection to specifically
   suggest
   the vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis/epidural abscess complex.

   ECG: ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Suboptimal image image qaulity
   prohibits adequate visualization of the distal LV/apex - however the
   apex (apical lateral) appears hypokinetic in some views. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible apical hypokinesis. If
   clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may assist in
   better defining regional LV systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Improved with nitro and lasix, on 4L
   - Largely improved; will run even
   - NTG gtt, wean off today
   -started on beta blocker today
   #. Fevers:
   Cultures yesterday and at the outside hospital are growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. Overall
   picture is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary
   discitis/abscess that has not been identified.
   - TEE today to look for valvular vegatations
   - f/u speciation
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone; f/u vanc level
   -if negative consider tagged wbc scan
   # NSTEMI- likely demand ischemia in setting of
   hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes
   Enzymes now trending down
   - daily asa
   - continue heparin for 24h, discontinuing this afternoon
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - start high dose statin
   #. Lower back pain: In the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute
   onset lower back pain, we remain suspicious of an epidural abscess or
   discitis.
   - w/u as above
   -morphine for pain
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to volume
   depletion and pain. Improved with fluids and pain control.
   -Continue morphine prn pain
   #. Renal failure: Was being worked up at OSH for
   paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike.
   - repeat SPEP
   - baseline is now likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new
   baseline.
   -renally dose meds
   .
   #. EKG changes: Patient with lateral ST depressions in V4-V6 with no
   baseline to compare to. Likely represnts demand ischemia in the setting
   of tachycardia. Will check as set of cardiac enzymes, and repeat EKG
   when tachycardia under better control.
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   -Will add on iron studies
   -Guiac stools
   - active T&S
   -Obtain records for baseline
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF,

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress. He was transferred to the ICU and diagnosed with acute pulmonary edema, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema. The patient's fever has improved, but blood cultures growing gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains suggest a possible streptococcal infection. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild aortic regurgitation, trace mitral regurgitation, and no vegetations. The patient also has a history of gout, asthma, and prostate symptoms with a biopsy done in 2003. He underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) on 02/20/20.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and subsequent development of acute pulmonary edema indicate a possible complication related to his cardiac condition.
2. Endovascular Infection: The presence of fevers and blood cultures growing gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains raises suspicion for an endovascular infection, such as infective endocarditis.
3. Discitis or Epidural Abscess: The patient's presentation of fever, leukocytosis, and acute onset lower back pain raises concern for discitis or epidural abscess, particularly given the ongoing evaluation for possible endovascular infection.
4. NSTEMI: The patient's symptoms of chest pain and E"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. On admission, he had a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 150/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on supplemental oxygen. He is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and dilaudid for pain management. The patient has been febrile since the previous night and has been started on ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) for suspected infection. His blood cultures have been drawn and are pending sensitivities. He also received ceftriaxone yesterday morning. Neurosurgery suspects that the patient's changing examination and back pain may represent an infection. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs have remained relatively stable, but he continues to have a fever. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been on a cardiac healthy diet. He is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is pending transfer to the floor once"

","Summary:
The patient is an ill-appearing gentleman with a fever of 101.8 and a history of back pain. He has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 150/67 mmHg and a heart rate of 86 bpm. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a SpO2 of 96%. 

The patient's blood cultures have shown gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. His white blood cell count is elevated at 13.9 K/uL, and his creatinine level is slightly elevated at 2.2 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes a cardiac condition for which he is prescribed a standing beta blocker and ACE inhibitor. However, the use of ACE inhibitor is temporarily withheld due to renal failure. The patient also has a history of back pain, for which he is receiving pain medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection. The identification of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains suggests a possible enterococcal infection. Further testing is needed to confirm the type of infection and determine appropriate treatment.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates compromised renal function. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, dehydration,"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   aortic valve endocarditis.
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE yesterday. Presumably from
   his recent TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue unasyn for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures
   - daily surveillance cultures
   # Low back pain: In setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute lower
   back pain, still highly suspicious of epidural abscess or discitis.
   However, given renal failure, unable to get MRI L-spine.
   - WBC scan in lieu of MRI L spine (to be started today and completed
   tomorrow)
   - Dilaudid prn for pain meds
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Off nitro gtt since yesterday, on 2 L NC, much
   improved
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue dilaudid prn
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - repeat SPEP, UPEP
   - renally dose meds
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. Fever: The patient has had a fever since September 21st, with a maximum temperature of 101.8°F.

2. Blood Cultures: Blood cultures have been taken multiple times, and the preliminary results show the presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The final results indicate Enterococcus species.

3. Aortic Valve Endocarditis: The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which revealed aortic valve endocarditis. This is likely related to his recent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) performed in [**2145**].

4. Low Back Pain: The patient's acute lower back pain, along with fevers and leukocytosis, raises suspicion for an epidural abscess or discitis. However, due to renal failure, an MRI of the lumbar spine is not possible at this time.

5. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient experienced acute pulmonary edema, possibly secondary to flash pulmonary edema. He has improved with 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and no longer requires nitroglycerin.

6. Elevated Troponins: Cardiology believes the elevated troponins are likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension and tachycardia, rather than distal"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   aortic valve endocarditis.
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE yesterday. Presumably from
   his recent TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue unasyn for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures
   # Low back pain: In setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute lower
   back pain, still highly suspicious of epidural abscess or discitis.
   However, given renal failure, unable to get MRI L-spine.
   - appreciate neurosurgery following/
   - WBC scan pending
   - MRI L Spine with gadolinium today despite renal risk given changing
   neuro exam.
   - Dilaudid prn for pain meds
   - q2h neurochecks
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Off nitro gtt since yesterday, on 2 L NC, much
   improved
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue dilaudid prn
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - repeat SPEP, UPEP
   - renally dose meds
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress. He was transferred to the ICU due to flash pulmonary edema and is now diagnosed with aortic valve endocarditis, likely caused by a recent TURP procedure. The patient also has leukocytosis, acute lower back pain, and renal failure. There are concerns about an epidural abscess or discitis, and an MRI L-spine is recommended despite the risk of renal failure. The patient's elevated troponins are likely due to demand ischemia rather than a myocardial infarction. He also has sinus tachycardia secondary to pain and chronic renal failure, possibly related to paraproteinemia/myeloma. Anemia is suspected to be related to underlying inflammation from the current process. There are also concerns about gout. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics for endocarditis, pain management, and cardiac support. He is being closely monitored in the ICU with regular assessments and investigations. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Aortic valve endocarditis: This condition can lead to further infection spread, heart failure, embolic events, and other complications related to the heart valve.
2. Epidural abscess or discitis: If present, it can cause severe back pain, neurological deficits, and potentially require surgical intervention.
3. Renal failure: Chronic renal failure may worsen, leading"

   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural
   abscesses.
   # Epidural Abscesses: Found on MRI L spine yesterday. Meeting yesterday
   with Neurosurgery and family determined that surgery would not be
   pursued at this time given small size of abscesses, cardiac risk given
   recent demand ischemia.
   - monitor neuro checks q4 hours
   - continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and
   ceftriaxone per ID
   - appreciate neurosurgery recs
   - f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   - WBC scan (2^nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
   - Pain control with neurontin, valium, Dilaudid PCA with encouragement
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE. Presumably from his recent
   TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures

   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - SPEP/UPEP pending

   - monitor Cr closely given recent contrast load
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema. He has been diagnosed with enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis and multiple small epidural abscesses. The decision was made not to pursue surgery due to the small size of the abscesses and the patient's cardiac risk. The patient's current condition is stable, with controlled vital signs and improved oxygenation. He is receiving treatment for the enterococcal infection with ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Pain control measures are in place, and daily surveillance cultures are being obtained until 48 hours of negative cultures. The patient's elevated troponins are likely due to demand ischemia, and he is on daily aspirin, high-dose statin, and beta-blocker. His renal function is compromised, and anemia may be related to inflammation from the current process. Further investigations are pending, including SPEP/UPEP, renal dosing of medications, and monitoring of creatinine levels. Constipation and gout are also noted but will be managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progression of epidural abscesses: The patient has multiple small epidural abscesses, which could potentially worsen and cause further spinal cord compression.
2. Heart failure: The patient's aortic valve endocarditis may lead to heart failure if not properly managed.

   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.

","Based on the provided information, the patient has been diagnosed with an infection, specifically an enterococcal bacteremia. The blood cultures showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, which are indicative of enterococcal infection. The sensitivity testing revealed that the organism is likely Enterococcus faecalis and is sensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin, and levofoxacin. 

In addition to the bloodstream infection, the patient also has an infection in the respiratory tract. The sputum culture showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, as well as the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Furthermore, imaging studies revealed multiple small abscesses at the level of L5, suggesting discitis at the L5/S1 level. The MRI findings indicate severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1 due to loculated fluid collections in the epidural space. There is also T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the levels of L5/S1 and L1/L2, which may suggest degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without evidence for abscess formation.

Considering these findings, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the bloodstream infection, progression of the respiratory tract infection, and further involvement of the spinal infection leading to neurological complications such as paralysis or nerve damage. It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural
   abscesses.
   # Epidural Abscesses: Found on MRI L spine yesterday. Meeting yesterday
   with Neurosurgery and family determined that surgery would not be
   pursued at this time given small size of abscesses, cardiac risk given
   recent demand ischemia.
   - monitor neuro checks q4 hours
   - continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and
   ceftriaxone per ID
   - appreciate neurosurgery recs
   - f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   - WBC scan (2^nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
   - Pain control with neurontin, valium, Dilaudid PCA
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE. Presumably from his recent
   TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures until 48 hours of negative cultures
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue pain control
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor Cr closely given recent contrast load
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, low back pain, respiratory distress, and a history of aortic valve endocarditis. The patient's condition has progressed with multiple complications. 

- Blood cultures have grown Enterococcus species, which are sensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin, and levofoxacin. The patient is being treated with ampicillin and ceftriaxone per ID for likely 6 weeks.
- An MRI of the lumbar spine revealed multiple loculated fluid collections within the posterior epidural space, causing severe spinal canal narrowing from L5 through S1. There are also T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at L5/S1 and L1/L2, suggesting degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without evidence of abscess.
- The patient has been evaluated by neurosurgery and it was determined that surgery would not be pursued at this time due to the small size of abscesses and cardiac risk given recent demand ischemia. The patient's neuro checks will be monitored every 4 hours.
- The patient's pain will be managed with neurontin, valium, and Dilaudid PCA.
- The patient's aortic valve endocarditis is presumed to be related to his recent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in [**2145**]. The patient will continue on ampicillin and c"
