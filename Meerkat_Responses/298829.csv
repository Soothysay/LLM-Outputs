   Assessment and Plan
   A/P
   62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV ICD here with
   hypoxic resp failure, acute renal failure and hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive, tachy, tachypneic and
   hypothermic with leukocytosis on admission.  Hypotension likely from
   combination of  poor po intake, pneumonia (sepsis) in setting of
   patient with poor cardiac reserve.  Does have trace heme+ stool as
   alternative for hypotension, but Hct near baseline to argue against
   significant bleed.  Other possibilies include cardiogenic origin but
   also less likely. Lactate has been normal (2.0 on admission).
   - 3 sets CE stable, elevated likely in the setting of renal failure and
   hypotension
   - TTE ordered for today to evaluate cardiac function
   - Continue to follow cultures (blood, urine and sputum)
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - Broad Abx coverage with Levoflox and vanco overnight. Given
   improvement in clinical status, will dc vancomycin.  Can broaden
   coverage if decompensates.
   - Fluid bolused with alternating between isotonic bicarb and NS given
   combined resp and metabolic acidosis as per renal overnight. Blood
   pressure and UOP was fluid responsive, no need for further IVF unless
   hypotension returns or UOP declines.
   - DIC labs negative
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely CAP given RLL infiltrate but
   with elevated BNP and long cardiac history as well as renal failure
   would suggest CHF/volume overload as contributing.  CAP pathogens:
   typical, atypical such as Legionella, influenza.  Course not consistent
   with PE and currently CTA would be contra-indicated.  Patient had high
   AG acidosis likely [**12-26**] uremia given MS changes and normal lactate as
   well as a resp acidosis at the time of admission.
   -  Cycled cardiac enzymes, elevated but with negative MBI, trop likely
   elevated in the setting of renal failure
   - Sputum culture, r/o influenza, legionella Ag
   - TTE as above
   - Hold diuresis for now as tolerating shovel mask
   - Levoflox as above for pna
   - Supportive O2 for now. Consider non invasive PPV for progressive
   hypoxemia if needed.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Prior baseline from [**2-18**] was Cr
   1.3.  Patient does use extensive NSAIDs and in setting of infection and
   hypotension ATN also possible.  Patient appears to have signs of uremia
   (altered mental status, itching, poor PO intake).  Lack of RBC on UA
   make active nephritis less likely.
   - Renal consult last pm recommended no HD last night, consider BiPap
   for respiratory acidosis if needed. Will review urine sediment and sent
   urine studies (UA, Upro/cr, Uosm, lytes)
   - Renal US today
   - Urine smear for eos given NSAID use is negative
   - FeNa, though after some hydration, is 0.8
   - ANCA sent for pulmonary renal syndrome
   - Dose adjust meds for GFR <10
   # Metabolic Acidosis: anion gap acidosis as primary disorder with
   inadequate respiratory compensation.  Not-consistent with lactic
   acidosis as normal lactate. Uremia is most likely.
   - Renal consult as above
   - Serum osms
 no osmolar gap, tox screen pos for opiates likely due to
   codeine for cough
   # Cardiac: Elevation in CK, MB and troponin and BNP (no priors) in the
   setting of volume overload and infection.  Likely an exacerbation of
   his underlying ischemic CM (ie strain), but he does have significant
   disease at his baseline. ECG without new ischemic changes. BiV ICD in
   place
   - ASA, statin given cardiac history
   - Holding blood pressure meds including BB for now
   - TTE as above
   - Cont ASA.
   # Altered Mental status: Mostly resolved today. Appears to be most
   consistent with generalized encephalopathy potentially due from uremia,
   hypoxia, infection.
   - Correct underlying disorder
   - Can consider CT head or LP if worsens

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and emphysema. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/61 mmHg to 121/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no new complaints.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to poor oral intake, pneumonia (sepsis), and poor cardiac reserve.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely caused by community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with right lower lobe infiltrate. Other contributing factors include congestive heart failure (CHF) and volume overload, as indicated by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, as evident from an elevated creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL on 02/18. Acute kidney injury (AKI) may be secondary to infection, hypotension, and the use of nonsteroidal anti"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and emphysema. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis. The patient has received a bolus of normal saline and isotonic bicarbonate, resulting in improved urine output and blood pressures. He is also alert and mentating appropriately.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypothermic with leukocytosis on admission. This could be due to a combination of poor oral intake, pneumonia (sepsis), and poor cardiac reserve.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) given the right lower lobe infiltrate. However, considering the elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and long cardiac history, congestive heart failure (CHF) or volume overload may also be contributing factors.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3, but it has now increased to 4.9. The use of extensive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) along with infection and hypotension raises the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), emphysema, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. He presents with hypotension, hypoxemia, and a right lower lung field infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient has been resuscitated with fluids and is now off pressors. He has shown improvement in renal function with decreasing creatinine levels. The patient's allergies include Simvastatin causing muscle pain. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is overweight and has a hoarse voice. Physical examination reveals symmetric chest expansion, rhonchi in the right lower lung field, and absent peripheral pulses. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin, and B-type natriuretic peptide levels, while other values are within normal limits. Imaging shows a faint diffuse bilateral hazy interstitial/alveolar pattern with improvement in the right lower lung field infiltrate. The patient is being treated with empiric levofloxacin for suspected severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and high-flow oxygen for hypoxemic respiratory failure. His condition is complicated by acute kidney injury (ARF) and metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient's symptoms of hypotension, hypoxemia, and right lower lung field infiltrate indicate the possibility of severe CAP. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to worsening respiratory failure and septic shock.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's history of CAD and the presence of elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide levels suggest cardiac dysfunction. This can further complicate his condition and increase the risk of cardiogenic shock.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. If not addressed promptly, ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis: The patient's ABG results show metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further deterioration in organ function, particularly respiratory and metabolic function.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and critical illness put him at an increased risk for DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple potential complications that require close monitoring and prompt management to improve his chances of recovery."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, emphysema, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and one week of oliguria, malaise, sinus symptoms, and visual hallucinations. He presented to the emergency department with hypotension and hypoxemia. A chest X-ray revealed right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient was resuscitated with fluids and put on high flow oxygen. His condition has been monitored in the ICU, where he remains off pressors. He is afebrile and has shown improvement in acute respiratory failure with decreased creatinine levels due to fluid administration. The patient's allergies include Simvastatin, which causes muscle pain. He has been receiving various medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Severe pneumonia (CAP) due to the right lower lung field infiltrate.
2. Dehydration, which could contribute to hypotension.
3. Legionella infection, as urine antigen testing is pending.
4. Cardiac dysfunction, possibly related to a history of coronary artery disease and NSAID use.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF), potentially caused by dehydration, cardiac failure, or NSAID use.
6. Metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis, possibly due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and medications.
7. Opiate use, indicated by the presence of codeine in cough syrup.
8. Risk of developing ventil"

    # Respiratory: likely hypoxic in the setting of pneumonia- improved;
   now on NC 5L with good O2 sats
   - cont levofloxacin
   - patient desats at night with apneic episodes; consult sleep fellow
   for CPAP, also call respiratory to set up CPAP at night
   - cont nebs PRN
   - hypotension resolved.  Not needing fluid boluses any longer
   - f/u cultures
   # GI: patient now having nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Seems most
   consistent with a viral gastroenteritis
   - had gastroccult + emesis.  PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Likely in the setting of NSAID
   use causing gastritis with poor PO intake

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV ICD here with
   hypoxic resp failure, acute renal failure and hypotension.
    # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive, tachy, tachypneic and
   hypothermic with leukocytosis on admission.  Hypotension likely from
   combination of  poor po intake, pneumonia (sepsis) in setting of
   patient with poor cardiac reserve.  Does have trace heme+ stool as
   alternative for hypotension, but Hct near baseline to argue against
   significant bleed.  Other possibilies include cardiogenic origin but
   also less likely. Lactate has been normal (2.0 on admission).
   - 3 sets CE stable, elevated likely in the setting of renal failure and
   hypotension
   - TTE ordered for today to evaluate cardiac function
   - Continue to follow cultures (blood, urine and sputum)
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - Broad Abx coverage with Levoflox and vanco overnight. Given
   improvement in clinical status, will dc vancomycin.  Can broaden
   coverage if decompensates.
   - Fluid bolused with alternating between isotonic bicarb and NS given
   combined resp and metabolic acidosis as per renal overnight. Blood
   pressure and UOP was fluid responsive, no need for further IVF unless
   hypotension returns or UOP declines.
   - DIC labs negative
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely CAP given RLL infiltrate but
   with elevated BNP and long cardiac history as well as renal failure
   would suggest CHF/volume overload as contributing.  CAP pathogens:
   typical, atypical such as Legionella, influenza.  Course not consistent
   with PE and currently CTA would be contra-indicated.  Patient had high
   AG acidosis likely [**12-26**] uremia given MS changes and normal lactate as
   well as a resp acidosis at the time of admission.
   -  Cycled cardiac enzymes, elevated but with negative MBI, trop likely
   elevated in the setting of renal failure
   - Sputum culture, r/o influenza, legionella Ag
   - TTE as above
   - Hold diuresis for now as tolerating shovel mask
   - Levoflox as above for pna
   - Supportive O2 for now. Consider non invasive PPV for progressive
   hypoxemia if needed.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Prior baseline from [**2-18**] was Cr
   1.3.  Patient does use extensive NSAIDs and in setting of infection and
   hypotension ATN also possible.  Patient appears to have signs of uremia
   (altered mental status, itching, poor PO intake).  Lack of RBC on UA
   make active nephritis less likely.
   - Renal consult last pm recommended no HD last night, consider BiPap
   for respiratory acidosis if needed. Will review urine sediment and sent
   urine studies (UA, Upro/cr, Uosm, lytes)
   - Renal US today
   - Urine smear for eos given NSAID use is negative
   - FeNa, though after some hydration, is 0.8
   - ANCA sent for pulmonary renal syndrome
   - Dose adjust meds for GFR <10
   # Metabolic Acidosis: anion gap acidosis as primary disorder with
   inadequate respiratory compensation.  Not-consistent with lactic
   acidosis as normal lactate. Uremia is most likely.
   - Renal consult as above
   - Serum osms
 no osmolar gap, tox screen pos for opiates likely due to
   codeine for cough
   # Cardiac: Elevation in CK, MB and troponin and BNP (no priors) in the
   setting of volume overload and infection.  Likely an exacerbation of
   his underlying ischemic CM (ie strain), but he does have significant
   disease at his baseline. ECG without new ischemic changes. BiV ICD in
   place
   - ASA, statin given cardiac history
   - Holding blood pressure meds including BB for now
   - TTE as above
   - Cont ASA.
   # Altered Mental status: Mostly resolved today. Appears to be most
   consistent with generalized encephalopathy potentially due from uremia,
   hypoxia, infection.
   - Correct underlying disorder
   - Can consider CT head or LP if worsens

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. He has a history of being on a BiV ICD (biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 38.0 C (100.4 F)
- Heart rate: 90 bpm
- Blood pressure: 145/73 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 95% on nasal cannula

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 12.1 thousand/mm^3
- Hematocrit: 31.9%
- Platelet count: 297 thousand/mm^3
- Creatinine: 4.9 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 84 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 0.44 ng/mL
- Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L
- Sodium: 136 mEq/L
- Chloride: 17 mEq/L

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypothermic. The likely cause is a combination of poor oral intake, pneumonia (sepsis), and the patient's poor cardiac reserve. Trace heme-positive stool suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, but the stable hematocrit argues against significant blood loss. Other possibilities include cardiogenic origin but are less likely. The patient will continue to be monitored, and further evaluation will be done to determine the underlying cause of hypotension.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) given the right lower lobe infiltrate. However, the elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and long cardiac history suggest congestive heart failure (CHF) or volume overload as contributing factors. The patient's course is not consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE), and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) would be contraindicated. The patient had high anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis likely due to uremia, as well as respiratory acidosis at the time of admission. 

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level from 2/18 was 1.3 mg/dL. He uses extensive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in the setting of infection and hypotension, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is also possible. The patient shows signs of uremia (altered mental status, itching, poor oral intake). Lack of red blood cells on urinalysis (UA) make active nephritis less likely.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV ICD here with
   hypoxic resp failure, acute renal failure and hypotension now with
   nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroccult + emesis
    # Respiratory: likely hypoxic in the setting of pneumonia- improved;
   now on NC 5L with good O2 sats
   - cont levofloxacin
   - patient desats at night with apneic episodes; consult sleep fellow
   for CPAP, also call respiratory to set up CPAP at night
   - cont nebs PRN
   - hypotension resolved.  Not needing fluid boluses any longer
   - f/u cultures
   # GI: patient now having nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Seems most
   consistent with a viral gastroenteritis
   - had gastroccult + emesis.  PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Likely in the setting of NSAID
   use causing gastritis with poor PO intake
   - ondansetron and compazine PRN nausea
   - f/u PM HCT
   - supportive IVFs for poor PO intake
   - NPO for now; if nausea/vomiting improves, can plan for advance to
   clears this afternoon
   # Acute Kidney Injury: markedly improved creatinine.  Back to baseline
   at 1.3
   - appreciate renal recs
   - having good UOP, possibly a component of post ATN diuresis.  Will
   give IVF to keep goal of even
   - will need f/u in renal clinic after discharge
   - this was likely in the setting of hypotension, NSAIDs
   # Cardiac: Elevation in CK, MB and troponin and BNP (no priors) in the
   setting of volume overload and infection.  Likely an exacerbation of
   his underlying ischemic CM (ie strain), but he does have significant
   disease at his baseline. ECG without new ischemic changes. BiV ICD in
   place
   - ASA, statin given cardiac history
   - Holding blood pressure meds including BB for now esp with hematemesis
   - TTE shows slightly improved EF
   - for HTN, can use hydral IV PRN for SBP>165.
   # Altered Mental status: improved during the day, slightly worse this
   AM, but improving now.  Possibly in the setting of sleep apnea or
   benzos
   - hold ativan for now
   - last ABG without evidence of CO2 retention. Cont to monitor O2 sats
   - no significant electrolyte abnormalities.  Cont to monitor.  Finger
   sticks within normal range

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrocult-positive emesis. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen with good oxygen saturation levels. He has improved from previous echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 40-50%. Renal function has also improved, and the patient is producing urine. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible exacerbation of underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy. He is on prophylactic heparin and a statin for his cardiac history. The patient's altered mental status has improved throughout the day but worsened slightly this morning, possibly due to sleep apnea or benzodiazepines. Vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 145/73 to 91/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,772 mL and output of 4,680 mL. The patient has received 1 liter of normal saline and is now on nasogastric suction with clear liquids. The patient's lab results show improved renal function and normal white blood cell count. The patient is currently on levofloxacin and will continue with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, admitted to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been unresponsive to treatment. Blood in emesis was observed this morning, and the patient has experienced apneas while sleeping. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 174/86 to 120/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is overweight and obese, with clear breath sounds but shallow, calm breathing. Physical examination also reveals warm skin, no rash, attentive and oriented neurologically, purposeful movements, and absent peripheral pulses on the right side. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine, troponin T, and lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures are negative for any growth, and they have tested negative for ANCA. The patient has been receiving IV fluids for autodiuresis, antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, and anticoagulation therapy. They are also on hydralazine for hypertension while NPO. The patient's respiratory failure has improved, but they still require high flow oxygen. Acute renal failure has returned to baseline"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of cardiomyopathy admitted to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is overweight and obese, with shallow, calm breathing. He has blood in emesis and witnessed apneas while sleeping. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 174/86 mmHg to 120/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and troponin-T levels. The patient's condition has improved, but he still requires high-flow oxygen. He has been started on CPAP for sleep and IV fluids for autodiuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if oxygenation does not improve. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications such as sepsis or respiratory distress.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent further deterioration. Diuretics may be used for fluid management.
4. Hypotension: The patient's"

   62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV ICD here with
   hypoxic resp failure, acute renal failure and hypotension now with
   episode of gastroccult + emesis.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely in the setting of pneumonia and
   pulm edema in the setting of ischemia cardiomyopathy - improved; now on
   NC 4L with good O2 sats
   - Cont levofloxacin for CAP
   - Patient desats at night with apneic episodes; awaiting read and
   recommendations from overnight sleep study (CPAP recs
 will inform RT
   when available)
   - Cont nebs PRN
   - Hypotension resolved.  Not needing fluid boluses any longer which
   will help with pulm edema
   - F/u cultures
   # GI: Patient with nausea, vomiting now resolved. Still with persistent
   loose stool.  Seems most consistent with a viral gastroenteritis though
   concern for C. Diff.  Hct stable after gastroccult pos emesis.
   - Had gastroccult + emesis.  PPI [**Hospital1 **] IV started, changed to PO qday
   today.  Was likely in the setting of NSAID use causing gastritis with
   poor PO intake
   - Ondansetron and compazine PRN nausea
   - Supportive IVFs for poor PO intake
   - Tolerated clears overnight, advance diet as tolerated as nausea
   improved.
   - Follow up C. diff
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Markedly improved creatinine.  Back to baseline
   at 1.0. Likely in the setting of NSAIDS, decreased PO and hypotension.
   - Appreciate renal recs, patient to follow up with renal as outpatient.
   - Having good UOP, possibly a component of post ATN diuresis.  Will
   give IVF to keep goal of even
   - Will continue to hold [**Last Name (un) 239**] today until Creatinine stable >24 per renal
   recs.
   # Cardiac: Elevation in CK, MB and troponin and BNP (no priors) in the
   setting of volume overload and infection.  Likely an exacerbation of
   his underlying ischemic CM (ie strain), but he does have significant
   disease at his baseline. ECG without new ischemic changes. BiV ICD in
   place
   - ASA, statin given cardiac history
   - Will restart BB today as BP stable and HR in the 80s-90s.  On
   amlodipine and hydral prn for elevated sbp > 165.
   - Will restart [**Last Name (un) 239**] tomorrow if creatinine continues ot be stable as
   above.
    - TTE shows slightly improved EF
   # Altered Mental status: Improved. Patient somnolent this morning,
   likely in the setting of sleep apnea
   - Hold ativan for now
   - Last ABG without evidence of CO2 retention. Cont to monitor O2 sats

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient experienced an episode of gastrocult positive emesis, likely due to NSAID use causing gastritis with poor oral intake. His nausea has since resolved, and he is tolerating clears. The patient's creatinine levels have improved, likely due to discontinuation of NSAIDs, decreased oral intake, and hypotension. His cardiac markers (CK-MB and troponin) show elevation, indicating possible exacerbation of underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient's altered mental status has improved, and he is no longer somnolent. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with an oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. He is being closely monitored for any changes in electrolyte abnormalities and is expected to be advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a rounded mid right lung opacity on chest X-ray, which raises suspicion for developing pneumonia.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of NSAID use and positive gastrocult emesis indicates a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Although the patient's creatinine levels have improved, there is still a concern for AKI due to previous hypotension, decreased oral"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. He is currently experiencing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and has a positive gastroccult test indicating emesis. The patient's respiratory condition has improved, and he is now on nasal cannula 5 liters with good oxygen saturation. His acute kidney injury has also improved, with a return to baseline creatinine level of 1.3. The patient's cardiac condition shows elevation in CK, MB, troponin, and BNP, indicating an exacerbation of his underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy. He has been given ASA and a statin for his cardiac history. His altered mental status has improved during the day but worsened slightly this morning, possibly due to sleep apnea or benzodiazepine use. The patient is being closely monitored for any changes in oxygen saturation, electrolyte abnormalities, and finger stick glucose levels. The patient's code status remains as full code, and his disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's round mid right lung opacity raises suspicion for a developing pneumonia. If left untreated, it can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and positive gastroccult test indicate emesis. There is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially"

","The patient's chief complaint is acute respiratory failure and respiratory distress. The patient underwent overnight polysomnography with no further episodes of hematemesis. The patient has allergies to Zocor (Simvastatin), which causes muscle pain. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin at 09:02 PM and Levofloxacin at 11:30 AM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. Other medications include ASA, effexor, amlodipine, PPI, and Lipitor. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except for the noted changes above.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F) and current temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F). The patient's heart rate is 83 bpm with a range of 78-98 bpm. Blood pressure readings range from 121/52 mmHg to 166/92 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute with a range of 9-23 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 96%. The patient's rhythm is ventricular paced. The patient's weight remains at 122.8 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,053 mL, including 1,162 mL by IV fluids. Output includes 3,935 mL of blood products, 1,160 mL of urine, and 450 mL of NG drainage. There is a fluid balance of -882 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device of a nasal cannula and SpO2 at 96%. ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, and other assessments. Lab results show a hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, leukocyte count of 303 K/uL, platelet count of 100 mg/dL, sodium level of 1.0 mg/dL, potassium level of 23 mEq/L, chloride level of 4.3 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 26 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 106 mEq/L, creatinine level of 140 mEq/L, glucose level of 35.3%, and other lab values. Radiology images are attached.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxic respiratory failure with improvement in FiO2 requirement, community-acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure with baseline creatinine levels, coronary artery disease with restart of beta-blocker, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding with nausea/vomiting secondary to viral gastroenteritis. The patient also has obstructive sleep apnea with witnessed apneas and is awaiting follow-up sleep study results for possible CPAP initiation on the floor. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and lines"

","Summary:
The patient is an obese man with acute respiratory failure, respiratory distress, and hypoxemic respiratory failure due to possible pneumonia and volume overload. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with decreased FiO2 requirement. The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF) with a creatinine level that has returned to baseline, likely due to acute tubular necrosis caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sepsis. Antibiotics have been started empirically for possible pneumonia. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and will have his beta-blocker restarted, with blood pressure trends being monitored. He is also on aspirin and statin therapy. The patient experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with coffee ground emesis, likely secondary to viral gastroenteritis and chronic NSAID use. No further episodes have occurred, and the patient will be switched to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) upon discharge. The patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with witnessed apneas, and a sleep study was performed last night with follow-up results for possible continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) initiation on the floor. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. His code status is full code, and he is being considered for transfer to the floor with noninvasive nocturnal ventilation if possible.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV ICD here with
   hypoxic resp failure [**12-26**] presumed CAP, acute kidney injury and
   hypotension and  episode of gastroccult + emesis now significantly
   improved
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely in the setting of pneumonia and
   pulm edema in the setting of ischemia cardiomyopathy - improved; now on
   NC 2L with good O2 sats
   - Cont levofloxacin for CAP
   - Patient desats at night with apneic episodes; didn
t tolerate nasal
   CPAP.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 984**] to see patient today regarding OSA.  Will likely
   need 4L overnight to prevent desats.
   - Cont nebs PRN
   - F/u cultures
   # GI: Patient with nausea, vomiting now resolved. Still with persistent
   loose stool.  Seems most consistent with a viral gastroenteritis though
   concern for C. Diff.  Hct stable after gastroccult pos emesis.
   - cont PO PPI
   - Ondansetron and compazine PRN nausea
   - tolerating regular diet; cont supportive care
   - Follow up C. diff. so far negative x 2.  awaiting 1 more.
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Markedly improved creatinine.  Back to baseline
   at 0.9. Likely in the setting of NSAIDS, decreased PO and hypotension.
   - Appreciate renal recs, patient to follow up with renal as outpatient.
   - Having good UOP, possibly a component of post ATN diuresis.
   - restart Valsartan 80 mg daily.
   # Cardiac: Elevation in CK, MB and troponin and BNP (no priors) in the
   setting of volume overload and infection.  Likely an exacerbation of
   his underlying ischemic CM (ie strain), but he does have significant
   disease at his baseline. ECG without new ischemic changes. BiV ICD in
   place
   - ASA, statin given cardiac history. Cont Bblocker, [**Last Name (un) 239**].
    - TTE shows slightly improved EF
   # Altered Mental status: Improved. Patient somnolent this morning,
   likely in the setting of sleep apnea
   - Hold ativan for now
   - Last ABG without evidence of CO2 retention. Cont to monitor O2 sats
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities.  Cont to monitor.  Finger
   sticks within normal range

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. He also experienced an episode of gastrocult and emesis. The patient's condition has improved significantly, but there are several ongoing concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema in the setting of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Although he has improved and is now on nasal cannula with good oxygen saturation levels, he still requires close monitoring. It is also noted that the patient has apneic episodes at night and did not tolerate nasal CPAP. Further evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea is recommended, and the patient may need to be placed on BiPAP (4L) overnight to prevent desaturation.

2. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient experienced nausea, vomiting, and persistent loose stool. These symptoms are most consistent with viral gastroenteritis, but there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection. Despite two negative stool cultures for C. difficile, the patient will continue to be monitored, and additional tests may be needed.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient had an episode of acute kidney injury, but his creatinine levels have markedly improved and returned to baseline. This improvement is likely due to stopping NSAIDs, decreased oral"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV ICD here with
   hypoxic resp failure, acute renal failure and hypotension now with
   episode of gastroccult + emesis.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely in the setting of pneumonia and
   pulm edema in the setting of ischemia cardiomyopathy - improved; now on
   NC 4L with good O2 sats
   - Cont levofloxacin for CAP
   - Patient desats at night with apneic episodes; awaiting read and
   recommendations from overnight sleep study (CPAP recs
 will inform RT
   when available)
   - Cont nebs PRN
   - Hypotension resolved.  Not needing fluid boluses any longer which
   will help with pulm edema
   - F/u cultures
   # GI: Patient with nausea, vomiting now resolved. Still with persistent
   loose stool.  Seems most consistent with a viral gastroenteritis though
   concern for C. Diff.  Hct stable after gastroccult pos emesis.
   - Had gastroccult + emesis.  PPI [**Hospital1 **] IV started, changed to PO qday
   today.  Was likely in the setting of NSAID use causing gastritis with
   poor PO intake
   - Ondansetron and compazine PRN nausea
   - Supportive IVFs for poor PO intake
   - Tolerated clears overnight, advance diet as tolerated as nausea
   improved.
   - Follow up C. diff
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Markedly improved creatinine.  Back to baseline
   at 1.0. Likely in the setting of NSAIDS, decreased PO and hypotension.
   - Appreciate renal recs, patient to follow up with renal as outpatient.
   - Having good UOP, possibly a component of post ATN diuresis.  Will
   give IVF to keep goal of even
   - Will continue to hold [**Last Name (un) 239**] today until Creatinine stable >24 per renal
   recs.
   # Cardiac: Elevation in CK, MB and troponin and BNP (no priors) in the
   setting of volume overload and infection.  Likely an exacerbation of
   his underlying ischemic CM (ie strain), but he does have significant
   disease at his baseline. ECG without new ischemic changes. BiV ICD in
   place
   - ASA, statin given cardiac history
   - Will restart BB today as BP stable and HR in the 80s-90s.  On
   amlodipine and hydral prn for elevated sbp > 165.
   - Will restart [**Last Name (un) 239**] tomorrow if creatinine continues ot be stable as
   above.
    - TTE shows slightly improved EF
   # Altered Mental status: Improved. Patient somnolent this morning,
   likely in the setting of sleep apnea
   - Hold ativan for now
   - Last ABG without evidence of CO2 retention. Cont to monitor O2 sats
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities.  Cont to monitor.  Finger
   sticks within normal range

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. He has now developed gastroenteritis, which seems consistent with viral gastroenteritis. His creatinine levels have improved, indicating improvement in acute kidney injury. There is evidence of cardiac strain due to volume overload and infection, but his ejection fraction on TTE is slightly improved. The patient's altered mental status has improved, and he is now alert and awake. His oxygen saturation levels are maintained with the use of a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. However, his condition has improved, and he is now being managed with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NCPAP).

2. Acute renal failure: The patient initially showed signs of acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels have returned to baseline, suggesting improvement. It is important to monitor his urine output and adjust fluid and medication management accordingly.

3. Gastroenteritis: The patient developed nausea, vomiting, and loose stools, which are consistent with viral gastroenteritis. He has been started on proton pump inhibitors and antiemetic medications as needed. Monitoring his hydration status and electrolyte balance is essential.

4. Cardiac strain: The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK, MB, and tro"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV ICD here with
   hypoxic resp failure, acute renal failure and hypotension now with
   episode of gastroccult + emesis.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely in the setting of pneumonia and
   pulm edema in the setting of ischemia cardiomyopathy - improved; now on
   NC 4L with good O2 sats
   - Cont levofloxacin for CAP
   - Patient desats at night with apneic episodes; awaiting read and
   recommendations from overnight sleep study (CPAP recs
 will inform RT
   when available)
   - Cont nebs PRN
   - Hypotension resolved.  Not needing fluid boluses any longer which
   will help with pulm edema
   - F/u cultures
   # GI: Patient with nausea, vomiting now resolved. Still with persistent
   loose stool.  Seems most consistent with a viral gastroenteritis though
   concern for C. Diff.  Hct stable after gastroccult pos emesis.
   - Had gastroccult + emesis.  PPI [**Hospital1 **] IV started, changed to PO qday
   today.  Was likely in the setting of NSAID use causing gastritis with
   poor PO intake
   - Ondansetron and compazine PRN nausea
   - Supportive IVFs for poor PO intake
   - Tolerated clears overnight, advance diet as tolerated as nausea
   improved.
   - Follow up C. diff
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Markedly improved creatinine.  Back to baseline
   at 1.0. Likely in the setting of NSAIDS, decreased PO and hypotension.
   - Appreciate renal recs, patient to follow up with renal as outpatient.
   - Having good UOP, possibly a component of post ATN diuresis.  Will
   give IVF to keep goal of even
   - Will continue to hold [**Last Name (un) 239**] today until Creatinine stable >24 per renal
   recs.
   # Cardiac: Elevation in CK, MB and troponin and BNP (no priors) in the
   setting of volume overload and infection.  Likely an exacerbation of
   his underlying ischemic CM (ie strain), but he does have significant
   disease at his baseline. ECG without new ischemic changes. BiV ICD in
   place
   - ASA, statin given cardiac history
   - Will restart BB today as BP stable and HR in the 80s-90s.  On
   amlodipine and hydral prn for elevated sbp > 165.
   - Will restart [**Last Name (un) 239**] tomorrow if creatinine continues ot be stable as
   above.
    - TTE shows slightly improved EF
   # Altered Mental status: Improved. Patient somnolent this morning,
   likely in the setting of sleep apnea
   - Hold ativan for now
   - Last ABG without evidence of CO2 retention. Cont to monitor O2 sats
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities.  Cont to monitor.  Finger
   sticks within normal range

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. He has experienced an episode of gastrocult and emesis, and has been treated with proton pump inhibitors and ondansetron as needed. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with good O2 sats. The patient's kidney injury has improved, with a return to baseline creatinine levels. He is being closely monitored for any changes in cardiac function, given his history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent elevation in cardiac markers. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is now alert and oriented. His electrolytes are within normal range, and he is being closely monitored for any potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, his condition has improved with the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure, likely caused by NSAID use, decreased oral intake, and hypotension. His renal function has improved, but ongoing monitoring of urine output and electrolyte balance"

   HYPOXEMIC RESP FAILURE: due to possible PNA, and volume overload-
   decreased FiO2 requirement now down to 2L.
   CAP: Cont empiric Levofloxacin for 7 day course
   ARF: Cr back to baseline. ATN with NSAIDs and sepsis. Restarted Diovan.
   CAD: restart Bblocker and trend BPs with this add on, continue ASA,
   statin
   UGIB/loose stools/coffee ground emesis: nausea/vom likely secondary to
   viral gastroenteritis. UGIB likely secondary to gastritis given h/o
   high NSAID use chronically. No further episodes, Change to PO PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   then likely QD. HCt stable.
   OSA with witnessed apneas by RN. Sleep study  pending, Sleep consult
   following. He could not tolerate  nasal CPAP last night, would use 4L
   with sleep and will need outpt sleep follow up

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint includes acute respiratory failure (ARF), respiratory distress, and gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient has a history of obesity, chronic NSAID use, and other medical conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient also has a recent diagnosis of pneumonia (PNA) and was previously on antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, but with slightly elevated respiratory rate. The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels indicating kidney dysfunction, and elevated cardiac markers. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, fair air movement in the chest, and no signs of edema or wheezing. The abdominal examination shows no abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for hypoxic respiratory failure due to possible PNA and volume overload, continuing empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected CAP, managing acute kidney injury (ATN), and addressing other comorbidities such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of kidney function, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT"
