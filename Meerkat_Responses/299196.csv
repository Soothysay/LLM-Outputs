   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O CROHN'S DISEASE (REGIONAL ENTERITIS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and HTN
   who presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute flare up of left sided
   abdominal pain.
   .
   #Abdominal pain: Pain not well controlled.  Predominantly LLQ area pain
   with associated fevers, nausea, dry heaves and nonbloody diarrhea up to
   20x daily per patient. Likely a flare-up of her underlying Crohn's
   disease. Negative for C. Diff.  CT Abdomen on [**8-12**] shows no bowel
   obstruction or abscess formation.  C.diff negative.  Additional
   gastroenteritis etiologies can not be ruled out as she is
   immunosuppressed and has history of frequent antibiotics.  She had been
   tentatively planning to have a joint surgery for ventral herniorrhaphy,
   proctosigmoidectomy and end colostomy jointly between Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
   [**Doctor First Name 8626**]coming weeks.
   --Increase Dilaudid PRN for abdominal pain, 0.5-1.5 mg Dilaudid q4h prn
   --IV Zofran for nausea
   --surgery recommends that patient may be stable to go to floor, but
   will reconfirm.
   --follow up GI
   --GI coverage with Abx: continue on vancomycin for enterococcus
   coverage, Flagyl and Zosyn for intra-abdominal infections and
   C.difficile coverage
   --Can likely discontinue flagyl as C. Diff negative.
   --continue IVFs for rehydration in setting of profound diarrhea,
   switching to LR to avoid non-AG metabolic acidosis
   --continue Asacol
   --consider steroids either PR or PO, but Humira may be best option
   --most likely plan to treat medically as Crohn
s flare
   #Atrial fibrillation: Longstanding known history of atrial fibrillation
   that was diagnosed about 10-11 months ago per patient. On home
   diltiazem and metoprolol TID for rate control and ASA 325mg daily.
   Likely exacerbated by recent dehydration in setting of diarrhea x 20
   daily, fevers, and poor PO intake. [**Month (only) 51**] also be related to thyroid
   dysfunction vs. new ACS, although less likely as having no SOB, CP.
   Cardiac enzymes negative.
   --rate control with IV metoprolol x1, followed by PO metoprolol TID
   regimen
   --change diltiazam to short acting to facilitate titration for rate
   control while in the ICU
   --Discontinue Advair
 long acting B blocker contraindicated
   --d/w surgery--restarting heparin while off of ASA in preparation for
   procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   [**Name (STitle) 8619**] aggressive CVP monitoring and IVFs
   --continue telemetry
   --repeat EKG
   --check TSH
   --consider TTE
   #Hypotension: Now resolved s/p 500 cc LR bolus and 1000 cc LR
   continuous at 70cc.  [Dropped to a low of 70s/40s in ED. Now has left
   IJ placed and getting additional IVFs on floor. Currently normotensive.
   She had drops in ED in setting of tachycardia to 140s per notes. ]
   --continue close monitoring on telemetry
   --maintain SBPs > 110 systolic, MAP> 65 range, CVP >[**8-14**]
   --continue IVF boluses, low continuous rate IVFs given ongoing diarrhea
   #Leukocytosis: WBC now 11.1 (nerutrophilia), decreased from 14. Likely
   due to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal
   abscesses. Meets SIRS criteria given rapid HR, temperatures >38 C, and
   WBC >12.  WBC possibly decreased today [**3-11**] 4+L of volume resuscitation
   on admission.
   --follow-up blood cultures, urine cultures
   --continue broad Abx coverage as outlined above for likely GI sources
   --monitor fevers, WBCs daily
   #Skin boil/furuncle - Possible underlying abscess over left groin
   region ar edge of mons pubis. Draining yellowish purulent discharge.
   +tenderness. Unlikely a fistula given apparent superficial location and
   distance from rectum.
   --consider f/up ultrasound
   --d/w surgery if need for I&D
   --f/u culture for swabs
   --continue on above Abx regimen with vanco/zosyn/flagyl x 48 hours
   total
   #FEN: Switch IVFs to LR to avoid non-AG metabolic acidosis, continue as
   NPO with ice chips overnight, replete electrolytes PRN, recheck lytes
   this afternoon given frequent K losses in diarrhea

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O CROHN'S DISEASE (REGIONAL ENTERITIS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and HTN
   who presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute flare up of left sided
   abdominal pain.
   .
   #Abdominal pain: Pain not well controlled.  Predominantly LLQ area pain
   with associated fevers, nausea, dry heaves and nonbloody diarrhea up to
   20x daily per patient. Likely a flare-up of her underlying Crohn's
   disease. Negative for C. Diff.  CT Abdomen on [**8-12**] shows no bowel
   obstruction or abscess formation.  C.diff negative.  Additional
   gastroenteritis etiologies can not be ruled out as she is
   immunosuppressed and has history of frequent antibiotics.  She had been
   tentatively planning to have a joint surgery for ventral herniorrhaphy,
   proctosigmoidectomy and end colostomy jointly between Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
   [**Doctor First Name 8626**]coming weeks.
   .
   --Increase Dilaudid PRN for abdominal pain
   --IV Zofran for nausea
   --surgery recommends that patient may be stable to go to floor, but
   will reconfirm.
   --GI coverage with Abx: continue on vancomycin for enterococcus
   coverage, Flagyl and Zosyn for intra-abdominal infections and
   C.difficile coverage
   --Can likely discontinue flagyl as C. Diff negative.
   --continue IVFs for rehydration in setting of profound diarrhea,
   switching to LR to avoid non-AG metabolic acidosis
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: Longstanding known history of atrial fibrillation
   that was diagnosed about 10-11 months ago per patient. On home
   diltiazem and metoprolol TID for rate control and ASA 325mg daily.
   Likely exacerbated by recent dehydration in setting of diarrhea x 20
   daily, fevers, and poor PO intake. [**Month (only) 51**] also be related to thyroid
   dysfunction vs. new ACS, although less likely as having no SOB, CP.
   .
   --rate control with IV metoprolol x1, followed by PO metoprolol TID
   regimen, will restart diltiazem a.m. dosing tomorrow
   --d/w surgery--restarting heparin while off of ASA in preparation for
   procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   [**Name (STitle) 8619**] aggressive CVP monitoring and IVFs
   --continue telemetry
   --repeat EKG
   --follow-up cardiac enzymes x 3 sets
   --check TSH
   --consider TTE
   .
   #Hypotension: Now resolved. Dropped to a low of 70s/40s in ED. Now has
   left IJ placed and getting additional IVFs on floor. Currently
   normotensive. She had drops in ED in setting of tachycardia to 140s per
   notes.
   .
   --continue close monitoring on telemetry
   --maintain SBPs > 110 systolic, MAP> 65 range, CVP >[**8-14**]
   --continue IVF boluses, low continuous rate IVFs given ongoing diarrhea
   .
   #Leukocytosis: WBC elevated to 14 range with neutrophilia. Likely due
   to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal abscesses.
   Meets SIRS criteria given rapid HR, temperatures >38 C, and WBC >12.
   .
   --follow-up blood cultures, urine cultures
   --continue broad Abx coverage as outlined above for likely GI sources
   --monitor fevers, WBCs daily
   .
   #Skin boil/furuncle - Possible underlying abscess over left groin
   region ar edge of mons pubis. Draining yellowish purulent discharge.
   +tenderness. Unlikely a fistula given apparent superficial location and
   distance from rectum.
   .
   --consider f/up ultrasound
   --d/w surgery if need for I&D
   --will collect swab for cultures
   --continue on above Abx regimen with vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   .
   #FEN: Switch IVFs to LR to avoid non-AG metabolic acidosis, continue as
   NPO with ice chips overnight, replete electrolytes PRN, recheck lytes
   this evening given frequent K losses in diarrhea

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O CROHN'S DISEASE (REGIONAL ENTERITIS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and HTN
   who presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute flare up of left sided
   abdominal pain.
   #Low blood pressure:  Patient has had low blood pressure with MAP
   around 60  since admission to ICU.  Patient has remained clinically
   stable with no dizziness, SOB, AMS, or chest pain.  While hypovolemic
   shock or sepsis were inital concerns upon admission, it seems more
   likely that the patient has mild hypovolemia in the setting of
   physiologic low blood pressure
   - monitor patient clinically, maintaining urine output >30cc/hr.  Close
   monitoring of CVP and central venous saturations do not benefit the
   patient or guide practice
   - transition from fluid bolus prn to continuous IVF at 150 cc hr LR.
   Patient is at risk of hypokalemia in setting of copious diarrhea so LR
   is better choice than NS for fluid resuscitation
   - decrease AV nodal blockade; d/c diltiazem to augment cardiac output
   - continue antibiotics for possible infectious gastroenteritis (see
   below)
   #Abdominal pain/ diarrhea: Abdominal pain has remained at patient
   baseline and seems more related to ventral hernia and multiple
   abdominal surgeries than an intraabdominal infection, especially as CT
   abdoman unrevealing.  Frequent  bowel movements most likely secondary
   to Chron
s flare vs gastroenteritis etiology (chronically
   immunosuppressed and on frequent antibiotics).  Patient has tentative
   joint surgery for ventral herniorrhaphy, proctosigmoidectomy and end
   colostomy with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor First Name 8618**] coming weeks.
   -- pain adequately controlled with Dilaudid 0.5- 1.5mg q3h prn
   --IV Zofran for nausea
   --surgery recommends that patient may be stable to go to floor, but
   will reconfirm.
   -- GI rec not start anti-crohn
s medications for now, cont. asacol
   -- continue broad spectrum Abx with vanco, zosyn, flagyl (day 2) for
   full 48 hrs: than de-escalate to fluoroquinolone unless stool cx
   dictate otherwise
   --continue IVFs for rehydration in setting of profound diarrhea
   -- hold anticoagulation for A. fib in setting of acute flare with
   bloody diarrhea
   #Atrial fibrillation: Longstanding known history of atrial fibrillation
   that was diagnosed about 10-11 months ago per patient. On home
   diltiazem and metoprolol TID for rate control and ASA 325mg daily.
   Likely exacerbated by recent dehydration in setting of diarrhea x 20
   daily, fevers, and poor PO intake.
   -- TSH normal, Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - cardiology consult appreciated: no indication for cardioversion now
   as patient has surgery planned and would need to be on anticoagulation
   three weeks prior to cardioversion and several weeks after
   --rate control with metoprolol 100mg PO TID regimen: dose reduction as
   necessary to maintain BP and HR
   --d/c diltiazem
   --Discontinue Advair
 long acting B blocker contraindicated
   --hold anticoagulation for now as patient has active Crohn
s flare and
   has planned surgery in future
   --continue telemetry
   --TTE  pending
   # Anemia: dropping Hct most likely dilutional but consider GI bleed in
   setting of Crohn
s flare
   -- check hct this pm
   -- active T+S
   -- transfuse for hct < 21
   #Leukocytosis: WBC now 11.1 (nerutrophilia), decreased from 14. Likely
   due to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal
   abscesses. Meets SIRS criteria given rapid HR, temperatures >38 C, and
   WBC >12.  WBC possibly decreased today [**3-11**] 4+L of volume resuscitation
   on admission.
   --follow-up blood cultures, urine cultures
   --continue broad Abx coverage as outlined above for likely GI sources
   --monitor fevers, WBCs daily
   #Skin boil/furuncle - Unlikely a fistula given apparent superficial
   location and distance from rectum

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and hypertension. She presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute left-sided abdominal pain. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient had low blood pressure with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 60, but remained clinically stable without any symptoms of dizziness, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or chest pain. The patient's urine output has been maintained above 30 cc/hr, and fluid resuscitation has been provided. 

The patient's abdominal pain is at baseline and seems related to her ventral hernia and multiple abdominal surgeries rather than an intraabdominal infection. The frequent bowel movements are likely secondary to a Crohn's flare-up rather than gastroenteritis. 

The patient has a longstanding history of atrial fibrillation, which may have been exacerbated by recent dehydration and poor oral intake. Rate control with metoprolol has been initiated, and anticoagulation has been held due to the patient's active Crohn's flare and planned surgery. 

The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal abscesses. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued to cover likely gastrointestinal sources of infection. 

The patient's skin boil/furuncle is unlikely to be a fistula given its superficial location and distance"

   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and HTN
   who presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute flare up of left sided
   abdominal pain.
   .
   #Abdominal pain: Pain not well controlled.  Predominantly LLQ area pain
   with associated fevers, nausea, dry heaves and nonbloody diarrhea up to
   20x daily per patient. Likely a flare-up of her underlying Crohn's
   disease. Negative for C. Diff.  CT Abdomen on [**8-12**] shows no bowel
   obstruction or abscess formation.  C.diff negative.  Additional
   gastroenteritis etiologies can not be ruled out as she is
   immunosuppressed and has history of frequent antibiotics.  She had been
   tentatively planning to have a joint surgery for ventral herniorrhaphy,
   proctosigmoidectomy and end colostomy jointly between Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
   [**Doctor First Name 8626**]coming weeks.
   --Increase Dilaudid PRN for abdominal pain, 0.5-1.5 mg Dilaudid q4h prn
   --IV Zofran for nausea
   --surgery recommends that patient may be stable to go to floor, but
   will reconfirm.
   --follow up GI
   --GI coverage with Abx: continue on vancomycin for enterococcus
   coverage, Flagyl and Zosyn for intra-abdominal infections and
   C.difficile coverage
   --Can likely discontinue flagyl as C. Diff negative.
   --continue IVFs for rehydration in setting of profound diarrhea,
   switching to LR to avoid non-AG metabolic acidosis
   --continue Asacol
   --consider steroids either PR or PO, but Humira may be best option
   --most likely plan to treat medically as Crohn
s flare
   #Atrial fibrillation: Longstanding known history of atrial fibrillation
   that was diagnosed about 10-11 months ago per patient. On home
   diltiazem and metoprolol TID for rate control and ASA 325mg daily.
   Likely exacerbated by recent dehydration in setting of diarrhea x 20
   daily, fevers, and poor PO intake. [**Month (only) 51**] also be related to thyroid
   dysfunction vs. new ACS, although less likely as having no SOB, CP.
   Cardiac enzymes negative.
   --rate control with IV metoprolol x1, followed by PO metoprolol TID
   regimen
   --change diltiazam to short acting to facilitate titration for rate
   control while in the ICU
   --Discontinue Advair
 long acting B blocker contraindicated
   --d/w surgery--restarting heparin while off of ASA in preparation for
   procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   [**Name (STitle) 8619**] aggressive CVP monitoring and IVFs
   --continue telemetry
   --repeat EKG
   --check TSH
   --consider TTE

   continuous at 70cc.  [Dropped to a low of 70s/40s in ED. Now has left
   IJ placed and getting additional IVFs on floor. Currently normotensive.
   She had drops in ED in setting of tachycardia to 140s per notes. ]
   --continue close monitoring on telemetry
   --maintain SBPs > 110 systolic, MAP> 65 range, CVP >[**8-14**]
   --continue IVF boluses, low continuous rate IVFs given ongoing diarrhea
   #Leukocytosis: WBC now 11.1 (nerutrophilia), decreased from 14. Likely
   due to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal
   abscesses. Meets SIRS criteria given rapid HR, temperatures >38 C, and
   WBC >12.  WBC possibly decreased today [**3-11**] 4+L of volume resuscitation
   on admission.
   --follow-up blood cultures, urine cultures
   --continue broad Abx coverage as outlined above for likely GI sources
   --monitor fevers, WBCs daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and hypertension. She presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute left-sided abdominal pain. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications including hypotension, leukocytosis, and a possible skin boil/furuncle. She is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's pain is not well-controlled, and she requires pain management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced a drop in blood pressure in the emergency department and required fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) is necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation, which may be exacerbated by recent dehydration and poor oral intake. Rate control with IV metoprolol and diltiazem is recommended.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal abscesses. Ongoing monitoring of fever and white blood cell count is necessary. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued for likely gastrointestinal sources.
4. Skin Boil/Furuncle: The patient has a possible underlying abscess over the left groin region. Further evaluation with"

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O CROHN'S DISEASE (REGIONAL ENTERITIS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and HTN
   who presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute flare up of left sided
   abdominal pain.
   #Low blood pressure:  Patient has had low blood pressure with MAP
   around 60  since admission to ICU.  Patient has remained clinically
   stable with no dizziness, SOB, AMS, or chest pain.  While hypovolemic
   shock or sepsis were inital concerns upon admission, it seems more
   likely that the patient has mild hypovolemia in the setting of
   physiologic low blood pressure
   - monitor patient clinically, maintaining urine output >30cc/hr.  Close
   monitoring of CVP and central venous saturations do not benefit the
   patient or guide practice
   - has not required fluid bolus while maintained on continuous IVF at
   125 cc hr LR.  Patient is at risk of hypokalemia in setting of copious
   diarrhea so LR is better choice than NS for fluid resuscitation
   - decrease AV nodal blockade; d/ced diltiazem to augment cardiac output
   - continue antibiotics for possible infectious gastroenteritis (see
   below)
   #Abdominal pain/ diarrhea: Abdominal pain has remained at patient
   baseline and seems more related to ventral hernia and multiple
   abdominal surgeries than an intraabdominal infection, especially as CT
   abdoman unrevealing.  Frequent  bowel movements most likely secondary
   to Chron
s flare vs gastroenteritis etiology (chronically
   immunosuppressed and on frequent antibiotics).  Patient has tentative
   joint surgery for ventral herniorrhaphy, proctosigmoidectomy and end
   colostomy with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 8618**] coming weeks.
   -- pain adequately controlled with Dilaudid 0.5- 1.5mg q3h prn
   --IV Zofran for nausea
   --surgery recommends that patient may be stable to go to floor, but
   will reconfirm.
   -- GI rec not start anti-crohn
s medications for now, cont. asacol
   -- de-escalate broad spectrum antibiotics to fluoroquinolone
   --continue IVFs for rehydration in setting of profound diarrhea
   -- hold anticoagulation for A. fib in setting of acute flare with
   bloody diarrhea
   #Atrial fibrillation: Longstanding known history of atrial fibrillation
   that was diagnosed about 10-11 months ago per patient. On home
   diltiazem and metoprolol TID for rate control and ASA 325mg daily.
   Likely exacerbated by recent dehydration in setting of diarrhea x 20
   daily, fevers, and poor PO intake.
   -- TSH normal, Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- cardiology consult requested by surgery in light of upcoming surgery
   -- no indication for cardioversion now as patient has surgery planned
   and would need to be on anticoagulation three weeks prior to
   cardioversion and several weeks after
   --rate control with metoprolol 100mg PO TID regimen: dose reduction as
   necessary to maintain BP and HR
   --Discontinue Advair
 long acting B blocker contraindicated
   --hold anticoagulation for now as patient has active Crohn
s flare and
   has planned surgery in future
   --continue telemetry
   --TTE  pending
   # Anemia: dropping Hct most likely dilutional but consider GI bleed in
   setting of Crohn
s flare
   -- check hct this pm
   -- active T+S
   -- transfuse for hct < 21
   #Leukocytosis: WBC now 11.1 (nerutrophilia), decreased from 14. Likely
   due to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal
   abscesses. Meets SIRS criteria given rapid HR, temperatures >38 C, and
   WBC >12.  WBC possibly decreased today [**3-11**] 4+L of volume resuscitation
   on admission.
   --follow-up blood cultures, urine cultures
   --continue broad Abx coverage as outlined above for likely GI sources
   --monitor fevers, WBCs daily
   #Skin boil/furuncle - Unlikely a fistula given apparent superficial
   location and distance from rectum
   -- stable
   -- local wound care

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and hypertension. She presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute left-sided abdominal pain. The patient has been experiencing episodes of desaturations below 90%, hypotension, and decreased urine output. She complains of frequent nonbloody stools but with diminished volume.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate 79 bpm, blood pressure 88/49 mmHg (80/25-119/82), respiratory rate 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 97%, and atrial fibrillation with a regular rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is petulant due to pain, with no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. Her neck is supple, and there are no lymphadenopathy or thyroid enlargement. Her cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with normal S1 and S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or appreciable jugular venous pressure. Her lung fields are clear bilaterally, and her abdomen is obese with tenderness in the left hand quadrant, especially over the ventral hernia. There is no guarding or rebound tenderness. Her extremities show no edema or calf pain, and she has 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. She"

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O CROHN'S DISEASE (REGIONAL ENTERITIS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and HTN
   who presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute flare up of left sided
   abdominal pain.
   #Low blood pressure:  Patient has had low blood pressure with MAP
   around 60  since admission to ICU.  Patient has remained clinically
   stable with no dizziness, SOB, AMS, or chest pain.  While hypovolemic
   shock or sepsis were inital concerns upon admission, it seems more
   likely that the patient has mild hypovolemia in the setting of
   physiologic low blood pressure
   - monitor patient clinically, maintaining urine output >30cc/hr.  Close
   monitoring of CVP and central venous saturations do not benefit the
   patient or guide practice
   - transition from fluid bolus prn to continuous IVF at 150 cc hr LR.
   Patient is at risk of hypokalemia in setting of copious diarrhea so LR
   is better choice than NS for fluid resuscitation
   - decrease AV nodal blockade; d/c diltiazem to augment cardiac output
   - continue antibiotics for possible infectious gastroenteritis (see
   below)
   #Abdominal pain/ diarrhea: Abdominal pain has remained at patient
   baseline and seems more related to ventral hernia and multiple
   abdominal surgeries than an intraabdominal infection, especially as CT
   abdoman unrevealing.  Frequent  bowel movements most likely secondary
   to Chron
s flare vs gastroenteritis etiology (chronically
   immunosuppressed and on frequent antibiotics).  Patient has tentative
   joint surgery for ventral herniorrhaphy, proctosigmoidectomy and end
   colostomy with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 8618**] coming weeks.
   -- pain adequately controlled with Dilaudid 0.5- 1.5mg q3h prn
   --IV Zofran for nausea
   --surgery recommends that patient may be stable to go to floor, but
   will reconfirm.
   -- GI rec not start anti-crohn
s medications for now, cont. asacol
   -- continue broad spectrum Abx with vanco, zosyn, flagyl (day 2) for
   full 48 hrs: than de-escalate to fluoroquinolone unless stool cx
   dictate otherwise
   --continue IVFs for rehydration in setting of profound diarrhea
   -- hold anticoagulation for A. fib in setting of acute flare with
   bloody diarrhea
   #Atrial fibrillation: Longstanding known history of atrial fibrillation
   that was diagnosed about 10-11 months ago per patient. On home
   diltiazem and metoprolol TID for rate control and ASA 325mg daily.
   Likely exacerbated by recent dehydration in setting of diarrhea x 20
   daily, fevers, and poor PO intake.
   -- TSH normal, Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - cardiology consult appreciated: no indication for cardioversion now
   as patient has surgery planned and would need to be on anticoagulation
   three weeks prior to cardioversion and several weeks after
   --rate control with metoprolol 100mg PO TID regimen: dose reduction as
   necessary to maintain BP and HR
   --d/c diltiazem
   --Discontinue Advair
 long acting B blocker contraindicated
   --hold anticoagulation for now as patient has active Crohn
s flare and
   has planned surgery in future
   --continue telemetry
   --TTE  pending
   # Anemia: dropping Hct most likely dilutional but consider GI bleed in
   setting of Crohn
s flare
   -- check hct this pm
   -- active T+S
   -- transfuse for hct < 21
   #Leukocytosis: WBC now 11.1 (nerutrophilia), decreased from 14. Likely
   due to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal
   abscesses. Meets SIRS criteria given rapid HR, temperatures >38 C, and
   WBC >12.  WBC possibly decreased today [**3-11**] 4+L of volume resuscitation
   on admission.
   --follow-up blood cultures, urine cultures
   --continue broad Abx coverage as outlined above for likely GI sources
   --monitor fevers, WBCs daily
   #Skin boil/furuncle - Unlikely a fistula given apparent superficial
   location and distance from rectum
   -- stable
   -- local wound care

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history significant for Crohn's disease, multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation, ventral hernia, and hypertension. She presents with fevers, diarrhea, and acute left-sided abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 88/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of chronic pain.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of desaturation below 90% and has required restarts of maintenance fluids for hypotension and decreased urine output. She has also had episodes of hypokalemia and is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances due to copious diarrhea.

The patient's abdominal pain is consistent with her baseline and seems more related to her ventral hernia and multiple abdominal surgeries rather than an intraabdominal infection. Frequent bowel movements are likely secondary to a Crohn's flare-up rather than gastroenteritis. The patient has a planned surgery for ventral herniorrhaphy, proctosigmoidectomy, and end colostomy.

The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to a Crohn's disease flare-up with possible intra-abdominal abscesses. She meets SIRS criteria with rapid heart rate, temperatures"

","Summary:
The patient is a pleasant and well-appearing individual in the ICU. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, and allergies to tetracycline. The patient experienced episodes of desaturations below 90% and hypotension with decreased urine output. They were restarted on maintenance fluids. The patient is currently on various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, heparin sodium, and hydromorphone.

Physical examination shows a regular heart rhythm with normal rate, no murmurs or rubs. The lungs are clear bilaterally, and there are no signs of edema or calf pain. Neurological examination is grossly intact with preserved sensation and strength throughout.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and platelets, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and sodium levels. The patient's creatinine level is within normal range, and troponin-T is negative.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications due to episodes of desaturations below 90%.
2. Hypotension and decreased urine output, which may indicate renal dysfunction or sepsis.
3. Atrial fibrillation, which can lead to potential embolic events.
4. Crohn's disease, which may present with abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection due to elevated white blood cell count and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
6. Possible fluid overload based"
