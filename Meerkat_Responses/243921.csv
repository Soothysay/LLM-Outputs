","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of GERD, anxiety, and myasthenia gravis, admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following extubation for Y-stent replacement. She is currently on Cellcept, Mestinon, and prednisone. The differential diagnosis for respiratory failure includes hypercarbia, hypoventilation from MG, or aspiration process.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 110/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 65 mmHg, PaO2 of 166 mmHg, and HCO3- of 35 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes in the upper airway, and her peripheral pulses are absent in both upper and lower extremities. Neurologically, she is attentive and follows simple commands, but movement, tone, and other neurological assessments are not evaluated.

Laboratory results include a WBC count of 16.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL, platelet count of 350 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of GERD, anxiety, and myasthenia gravis who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following extubation for Y-stent replacement. She has been on Cellcept, Mestinon, and prednisone. The differential diagnosis for respiratory failure includes hypercarbia, hypoventilation from MG, or aspiration process. The patient's NIFs are stable with low VC that is steadily increasing. She has been taken off BiPap, and her tachycardia has resolved. Her O2 saturation is in the low 90s and stable. A difficult airway has been noted, and she has been intubated using fiberscopic guidance in the past. Her CXR is clear of infiltrate, and a repeat ABG has been ordered. Neurology has been consulted for the possibility of MG component to respiratory status. Urine and sputum are being sent for evaluation and culture, and c. diff toxin is being checked. The patient is to continue prednisone at 20 mg, Mestinone at 60 Q4h, and Cellcept at 1000mg PO BID. She also has a history of TBM and is scheduled for Y stent follow-up with IP consult service. Diarrhea is also a concern, and empiric treatment for c. diff is deferred for now. Anxiety/panic disorder is being managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following extubation for Y-stent replacement. She has a history of GERD, anxiety, and is on medication including Cellcept, Mestinon, and Prednisone. The patient's chief complaints include headache and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and her NIFs have improved overnight, but she remains hypercarbic and still experiences a headache. BiPAP has been initiated and will be continued as needed during the day and overnight. Repeat ABG will be done later in the day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to hypercarbia, hypoventilation from MG, or aspiration process. Continuous BiPAP support will be provided.
2. Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation: The patient's MG may be exacerbated by anesthesia. Neurology consultation has been requested for further evaluation and management.
3. Infection: The patient's sputum and urine will be sent for evaluation and culture to check for any potential infections, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff).
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea will be investigated, and C. diff toxin will be checked. Empiric treatment for diarrhea will be deferred for now.
5. Anxiety/Panic Disorder: The patient will continue on Paxil 15"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) and tracheobronchomalacia who underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with Y-stent placement. She was extubated post-operatively but subsequently experienced hypoxia due to respiratory muscle weakness caused by missed pyridostigmine. The patient was placed on BiPAP and admitted to the medical ICU (MICU).

The patient's ABG results indicate acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis. A trial off BiPAP was attempted this morning, but the patient's PCO2 levels remained in the 70s, so BiPAP was restarted. Neurology was consulted, and they suggested investigating potential underlying infections as a cause for worsening MG. Cultures were obtained, including C. difficile, but no positive results have been observed yet. If the patient does not improve by tomorrow, a CT chest will be performed to evaluate the lung parenchyma.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax 37.5 C (99.5 F), Tcurrent 37.1 C (98.8 F), HR 95 bpm (80-118 bpm), BP 144/77 mmHg (93/49-152/82 mmHg), RR 13 inspirations per minute (12-26 inspirations per minute), and SpO2 91%. The patient's heart rhythm is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) and tracheobronchomalacia. She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with Y-stent placement and post-operative extubation. However, she experienced hypoxia due to respiratory muscle weakness from not taking her pyridostigmine medication. The patient was placed on BiPAP and is currently in the MICU. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis. A trial off BiPAP resulted in high PCO2 levels, so she was put back on it. Neurology consultation was sought, and they suggested looking for underlying infection as a potential cause of worsening MG. Cultures were obtained, but no infection has been identified yet. If the patient does not improve tomorrow, a CT chest will be done to evaluate the lung parenchyma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening myasthenia gravis and tracheobronchomalacia.
2. Infection, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which can cause diarrhea and worsen respiratory symptoms.
3. Hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation and oxygenation.
4. Pneumonia or other lung infections that may require further diagnostic evaluation, such as a CT chest.
5. Myasthenic crisis, which is a severe exacerbation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of GERD, anxiety, and myasthenia gravis (MG), who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following extubation for Y-stent replacement. The differential diagnosis for respiratory failure includes hypercarbia, hypoventilation from MG, or aspiration process. The patient has been on Cellcept, Mestinon, and prednisone.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/71 to 150/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia.

The patient's neurologic examination reveals ptosis, with left greater than right, and full extraocular movements. The patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to three items. Movement and tone are not assessed. The patient's labs show a WBC count ranging from 16.3 to 8.8 thousand/mm3, Hct ranging from 37.5 to 41.2%, and platelet count ranging from 298 to 297 thousand/mm3. Other lab values include slightly elevated TCO2, glucose levels ranging from 128 to 141 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of myasthenia, tracheobronchomalacia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with Y-stent placement and post-operative extubation. However, she experienced hypoxia due to respiratory muscle weakness from not taking her pyridostigmine medication. She was placed on BiPAP and is currently in the MICU. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis. Neurology consultation was sought, and they suggested looking for underlying infection as a potential cause of worsening myasthenia gravis. Cultures were done, but no infection has been identified yet.

The patient refused BiPAP overnight and continues to experience headaches and double vision. She has allergies to adhesive tape and lorazepam, which cause restlessness. Her last dose of antibiotics was on [date]. She is receiving various infusions and other ICU medications, including pantoprazole.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 131 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129/71 to 150/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and tracheobronchomalacia. She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with Y-stent placement but experienced hypoxia post-operation, likely due to respiratory muscle weakness from not taking her pyridostigmine. She was intubated and placed on BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) but refused it overnight. Her headache and double vision could be attributed to hypercarbia. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, with a heart rate of 131 beats per minute. Her blood gas analysis shows acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis with a pCO2 level of 70s. She has been receiving BiPAP during the day and is expected to resume it overnight. The patient's laboratory results reveal normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium levels. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for potential underlying infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition is complicated by acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, characterized by hypercarbia. The use of BiPAP can help improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Myasthenia Gravis exacerbation: The patient's respiratory muscle weakness may worsen due to MG, leading to further respiratory compromise.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman who is admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following extubation for Y-stent replacement. She has a history of GERD, anxiety, and is on medications including Cellcept, Mestinon, and Prednisone. The differential diagnosis for her respiratory failure includes hypercarbia, hypoventilation from myasthenia gravis (MG), or aspiration process. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/79 to 90/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. She is experiencing sinus tachycardia and has a headache. 

Her fluid balance shows an input of 1,100 mL and output of 1,450 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 350 mL. She is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 82 mmHg, and PaO2 of 60 mmHg. 

The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and her neurologic examination is also not performed. 

Her lab results show elevated WBC count of 14.5 K/uL, Hct level of 38.8%, and platelet count of 350. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to hypercarbia, hypoventilation from MG, or aspiration process. She continues to be hypercarbic and experiences a headache. The plan includes using BiPAP overnight and as needed, repeating a chest X-ray, and consulting a neurologist for myasthenia gravis. Prednisone is continued at 20 mg, Mestinon is increased to 60 mg every 4 hours, and Cellcept is continued at 1000 mg orally twice daily. The patient is also being monitored for TBM, tachycardia, diarrhea, and anxiety/panic disorder."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of GERD, anxiety, and myasthenia gravis who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following extubation for Y-stent replacement. She is currently on Cellcept, Mestinon, and prednisone. The differential diagnosis for her respiratory failure includes hypercarbia, hypoventilation from myasthenia gravis, or aspiration process. She remains hypercarbic and experiences headaches, likely due to hypercarbia. The patient refused BiPAP overnight but was discussed with her about the need for it. NIFs have improved overnight, and her vital signs are relatively stable. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, and an ECG is planned for today. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and anxiety disorder. She has been started on Tylenol for her headache, and her current medications include Cellcept, Mestinon, and prednisone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and previous pulmonary function tests indicating a neuromuscular component to her respiratory failure suggest that she may continue to experience respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation: The patient's myasthenia gravis may be exacerbated by anesthesia, leading to further respiratory compromise.
3. Hypercarbia: The patient's continued hypercar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis, hypertension, and anxiety, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress following an extubation for Y-stent replacement. She was transferred to the floor but returned to the ICU due to respiratory distress. Her current condition is stable, but she continues to experience tachycardia and hypercarbia. She is being treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's previous ICU stay showed neuromuscular components to her respiratory failure, and her pulmonary function tests (PFTs) indicate an improvement overnight. She is also being treated for myasthenia gravis, headache, tuberculosis (TBM), diarrhea, and anxiety/panic disorder. Her blood glucose levels are within normal range, and she is receiving nutrition and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers."
