","The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and hypothermia. The patient has a medical history of penicillin and sulfa allergies. He is currently receiving multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, norepinephrine, and octreotide through infusions. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.4Â°C (95.8Â°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 108/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal ventilation. The patient's weight has increased from 56 kg at admission to 68 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an input of 9,100 mL and output of 72 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's urine output is 72 mL and nasogastric output is 17 mL. The blood product transfusion was 1,945 mL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.24, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, PaO2 of 103 mmHg, HCO3- of 20 mEq/L, BE of -7 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The respiratory support shows a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%, and plateau pressure of 38 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a glucose level of 156 mg/dL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.4%, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 20 mmHg, and other abnormal values.

The patient is diagnosed with hematemesis (upper gastrointestinal bleed), respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), and hypothermia. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status and requires ongoing ICU care. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and infection due to prolonged intubation."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known esophageal
   varices and multiple epidoses of UGIB and banding this admission,
   polymicrobial SBP, now with recurrent UGIB.
   .
   # Hematemesis, known varices c/b 3 point hematocrit drop since last
   night
   -- EGD now, needs intubation discussed with family and GI who agree
   with  this
   -- 3 units PRBC and 4 units FFP now
   -- Serial INR, fibrinogen, CBC q6H
   -- PRBC for Hct < 26, FFP for INR > 2.0, platelets if < 50
   -- PPI, octreotide gtt
   -- Maintain peripheral IV access in addition to TLC
   .
   # Persistent leukocytosis. Complicated history of peritonitis, ?
   cholangitis, and esophagitis. Cdiff has been negative. Blood and urine
   cultures negative. No PNA seen on CXR.
   -- continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] to cover for aspiration pna and peritonitis
   -- continue caspofungin for esophagitis and peritonitis with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1656**]
   -- monitor fever curve, WBC
   .
   # ESLD/cirrhosis: On liver transplant list. Complicated by ascites,
   portal gastropathy, and SBP. No clear history of encephalopathy.
   -- ursodiol [**Hospital1 **], lactulose 30 mg daily
   -- hold spironolactone/lasix, nadolol in setting of above
   -- Continue lactulose
   .
   # Biliary strictures: Pull back cholangiography on [**1-10**] demonstrated
   no obstruction. PTC drain removed by IR [**2185-1-10**]. Bili peaked [**1-13**],
   decreasing now.
   -- Trend LFTs to assess for complications of PTC removal (ie,
   cholangitis)
   .
   # Hypernatremia - likely due to poor po intake
   -- d5W x 1 liter overnight
   -- trend Na
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis:
   -- Continue outpatient Mesalamine.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   -- continue statin. Holding ASA and BB in setting of bleed.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -- Continue outpatient dose statin.
   .
   # Depression/ADHD:
   -- Continue sertraline. Hold Ritalin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He is currently admitted to the ICU due to recurrent UGIB, resulting in hematemesis and a 3-point drop in hematocrit since last night. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, but intubation was discussed and agreed upon by the family and gastroenterology team. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Serial measurements of international normalized ratio (INR), fibrinogen, and complete blood count (CBC) are planned every 6 hours. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and octreotide are being administered. Peripheral intravenous (IV) access is maintained in addition to a central line.

Other medical conditions include persistent leukocytosis, complicated history of peritonitis, possible cholangitis, and esophagitis. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been negative, and blood and urine cultures are negative as well. No pneumonia (PNA) is seen on chest X-ray. Vancomycin and caspofungin are continued to cover for aspiration pneumonia and peritonitis. Fever curve and white blood cell (WBC) count are"
