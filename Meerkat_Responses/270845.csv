   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient could be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent
   (perhaps less likely with Y-stent).
   - NPO overnight for bronchoscopy in AM
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   - Re-eval after bronchoscopy
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - sputum with coag + staph and increased secretions, will cover with
   antibiotics Vancomycin for a likely short course of abx
   - Trend CXR
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Creatinine at trending up from baseline of 2.1
   to 2.5 today
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease/renal insufficiency.
   Patient takes Procrit injections as outpatient. Hct currently above
   baseline of 27-30, which may indicate hemoconcentration.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Microscopic hematuria: Patient has had similar findings on multiple
   prior U/A's. Could relate to placement of Foley (traumatic) but cannot
   exclude underlying bladder pathology. Review shows large blood but
   minimal RBCs, ?hemo/myoglobinuria. CK normal and normal coags.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type II: stable
   - Continue home regimen of Glargine 18 units AM and humalog insulin
   .
   # CAD: denies curreny chest pain. EKG at baseline. continue home meds
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily
   - Metoprolol tartrate 50mg twice daily
   - Simvastatin 80mg daily
   .
   # HTN: Well-controlled.
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily
   - Lasix 40mg daily
   .
   # Asthma: as above
   - Continue fluticasone, singulair, mucomyst and albuterol nebs prn
   - Hold fexofenadine during this admission (loratadine not formulary)
   .
   # Insomnia:
   - Will start with home trazodone
   - Consider Ativan if pt unable to sleep (per his request)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and hypertension (HTN). The patient has been admitted to the ICU with acute shortness of breath, likely due to mechanical causes such as stent migration, infection/pneumonia, aspiration, or pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea may be related to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging or stent displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus.

The patient has been intubated, and their respiratory status is being monitored. They are NPO overnight for a planned bronchoscopy in the morning. The patient's medications include albuterol MDI, fluticasone, gabapentin, Singulair, and hold tussin. They also have a history of asthma and are being treated accordingly.

The patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no bands, which could be secondary to inflammation induced by stent displacement or an underlying infection. The patient is currently afebrile, and antibiotics (Vancomycin) will be started for coverage.

The patient's creatinine is trending up from a baseline of 2.1 to 2.5 today, indicating chronic renal failure. Renally dosed medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.

","The patient presents with acute collapse of the left lung, respiratory distress, and suspected stent migration. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 7 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and plateau pressure of 12 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 99%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal blood pressure within the range of 135/45-152/61 mmHg, heart rate between 60-72 beats per minute, and a first-degree AV block. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,270 mL and output of 1,395 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 125 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood glucose level, and an increase in creatinine level. Other lab values appear within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, symmetric chest expansion, and warm skin. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's intubation.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type I, chronic renal failure, anemia, coronary artery disease, and asthma. The assessment and plan include resolving left lung collapse, evaluating the stent and tracheostomy site, addressing"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent, now s/p stent removal by IP
   on [**4-13**].
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient may be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent.
   Rigid bronchoscopy on [**4-13**] showed stent migration, and the stent was
   removed; necrotic tissue at the buttonhole was debrided.
   - Plan to return to OR for repeat bronch and possible stent placement
   (will confirm timing with IR)
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
 currently off ventilator
   on trach mask, doing well
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - sputum with coag + staph and increased secretions, will cover with
   antibiotics (Vancomycin 1000 mg Q48h, day 1 = [**4-13**]) for a likely short
   course of abx
   - Trend CXR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and asthma. The patient presented with acute shortness of breath, likely due to mechanical complications such as stent migration, infection/pneumonia, aspiration, or pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea may be related to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging or stent displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus.

The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy on [**2155-4-13**] which showed stent migration, and the stent was removed. Necrotic tissue at the buttonhole was debrided. The plan is to return to the operating room for repeat bronchoscopy and possible stent placement. The patient is currently off the ventilator and doing well on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no bands, possibly secondary to inflammation induced by stent displacement or underlying infection. The patient is currently afebrile. Antibiotics (Vancomycin 1000 mg Q48h, starting on [**4-13**]) have been initiated for a likely short course of treatment.

The patient's creatinine levels are trending up from baseline, indicating chronic renal failure. Renal dosing of medications and avoiding nephrotoxins are recommended"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and asthma. He presented with acute shortness of breath, likely due to mechanical obstruction from shifting of his tracheal Y stent. The patient has undergone intubation and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs, possibly secondary to inflammation induced by stent displacement or underlying infection. The patient's creatinine levels are trending up, indicating chronic renal failure. He also has microscopic hematuria, which may be related to Foley catheter placement or underlying bladder pathology. His diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and asthma are stable. The patient will undergo bronchoscopy in the morning to further evaluate and manage his respiratory status.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has risk factors for pneumonia, including mechanical ventilation and potential aspiration. Monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be important to identify and treat any infection.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of lung sounds and consideration of bronchoscopy may be necessary to rule out this complication.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should continue to be closely monitored, as there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, especially"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU for acute shortness of breath and underwent stent removal due to migration. The patient has inflammation and necrotic tissue at the buttonhole site, which was debrided during the procedure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of asthma and may experience bronchospasm, mucous plugging, or pneumonia due to the stent displacement and subsequent inflammation.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with elevated PMNs, indicating a possible infection. There is also growth of Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum culture.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending up, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to underlying chronic renal failure or acute kidney injury.
4. Anemia: The patient has a high hematocrit level, which may indicate hemoconcentration. This could be secondary to chronic disease or renal insufficiency.
5. Microscopic Hematuria: The patient has persistent microscopic hematuria, which could be related to the placement of a Foley catheter or underlying bladder pathology.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's FSG today shows mid-to-upper"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent, now s/p stent removal by IP
   on [**4-13**].
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient may be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent.
   Rigid bronchoscopy on [**4-13**] showed stent migration, and the stent was
   removed; necrotic tissue at the buttonhole was debrided.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and hypertension (HTN). The patient presented with acute shortness of breath, likely due to stent migration, and underwent stent removal. 

The patient's current assessment includes dyspnea/stridor, leukocytosis, chronic renal failure, anemia, microscopic hematuria, diabetes mellitus type II, CAD, HTN, asthma, and insomnia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent stent migration and removal, as well as the presence of necrotic tissue, increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or further airway obstruction.

2. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with increased neutrophils, suggesting a possible infection. The sputum culture showed moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus, indicating a need for antibiotic coverage.

3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending up, indicating worsening renal function. This may require adjustment of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is within the normal range, suggesting that the anemia is likely secondary to chronic disease or renal insufficiency.
