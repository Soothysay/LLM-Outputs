   Assessment and Plan
   Resp distress post bronch - status has been worsening over past number
   of weeks. Has a number of possible explanations including COPD,
   infection, progressive TBM, stent obstruction and cancer progression.
   Will treat COPD flare with steroids, bronchodilators, antibiotics.
   Check CXR. BIPAP overnight. Stent replacement per IP.
   Lung cancer - does not appear that there are treatment options.
   Continue supportive care.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of COPD, tuberculosis (TBM), and a y-stent in place due to a right upper lobe (RUL) resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient presented with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and somnolence. During bronchoscopy, secretions were observed throughout the right side, and post-bronchoscopy was complicated by hypoxemia and hypoventilation. The patient was placed on higher oxygen and improved.

The plan is for stent replacement in 2 days in the operating room (OR). The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs, and the last dose of antibiotics was not mentioned. The patient is currently on ICU medications and other medications, but specific names are not provided.

The patient's medical history includes COPD, TBM with a Y-stent, RUL resection for NSCLC, recurrent NSCLC, and active smoking. The patient also has untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tracheobronchomalacia, and previous right upper lobe resection for squamous cell carcinoma. He was admitted to the MICU for COPD exacerbation and closer respiratory monitoring. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been unresponsive to Bipap. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 88/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 62 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 173. His labs indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.8 K/uL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD exacerbation and decreased breath sounds in lung exam suggest a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory support and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count indicates leukocytosis, which may suggest an underlying infection. Further evaluation is needed through sputum culture and urine analysis.
3. Chronic respiratory acidosis: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.43 and PaCO"

   Disposition :ICU
","The patient's chief complaint is somnolence and hypoxia following a bronchoscopy. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and was stable overnight. They declined the use of bipap after a 30-minute trial. The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD/OSA, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) recurrence in the right lower lobe. They also have leukocytosis, which may be related to steroids, malignancy, or a leukemic reaction. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/57 mmHg to 141/79 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is not well nourished and thin, with normal head, ears, nose, and throat findings. There are wheezes and rhonchi present on respiratory examination. The patient has soft and non-tender abdominal findings, warm skin, and normal muscle tone. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal muscle tone. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with end-stage COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and a history of squamous cell carcinoma.
- The patient was admitted to the MICU for a COPD exacerbation and closer respiratory monitoring.
- The patient's current medications include solumedrol, albuterol/ipratropium, azithromycin, Mucomyst, Mucinex, and Advair.
- The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 18.9 to 25.1 K/uL.
- The patient's ABG results indicate chronic respiratory acidosis.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, gout, and pain management.
- The patient is NPO for an upcoming procedure today.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he prefers to withdraw care if requiring aggressive life-saving measures for three days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's current admission is for a COPD exacerbation. This can lead to respiratory distress, increased work of breathing, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and presence of multiple organisms on gram stain of sputum suggest a possible infection. Monitoring for worsening symptoms and follow-up cultures are necessary.
3. Hypercarbia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and squamous cell carcinoma. He was admitted to the MICU for a COPD exacerbation and closer respiratory monitoring. The patient's current medications include solumedrol, albuterol/ipratropium, azithromycin, Mucomyst, Mucinex, and Advair. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/77 mmHg to 92/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.8 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, elevated sodium level of 151 mg/dL, and normal potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lung, diffuse wheezing, and multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora on gram stain of sputum. The patient's plan includes continuing solumedrol and other medications, treating with azithromycin for increased sputum production, and arranging an OR procedure for exchange stent and debridement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with end-stage COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and a history of squamous cell carcinoma. He was admitted to the MICU for a COPD exacerbation and closer respiratory monitoring. The patient has worsening hyponatremia and was given a trial of normal saline IVFs, which improved his repeat lytes. He is currently on decreased steroids, and his sputum culture did not show any growth. The patient has leukocytosis, likely secondary to IV steroids or possible infection. He has chronic respiratory acidosis, tracheobronchomalacia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, pain, gout, and is NPO for an upcoming procedure. The patient's code status is full code, and he prefers to withdraw care if requiring aggressive life-saving measures for more than three days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Monitoring of WBC and follow-up cultures are planned.
2. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has worsening hyponatremia, and careful monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte balance are necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis and a history of COPD exacerbation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and ongoing management of oxygenation and ventilation are essential.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia: The"
