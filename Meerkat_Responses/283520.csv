   [**Hospital1 966**] which showed actinomyces, which he was not treated for due to the
   fact he was lost to follow up.  His new dyspnea/hypoxia may be further
   worsening of this underlying actinomyces infection, or another
   superinfection on top of that.  Malignancy is also possible, though
   seems less likely.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer post left pneumonectomy, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He presented with worsening dyspnea, low-grade temperatures, and productive cough. He was transferred to the MICU for tachypnea. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and is currently being treated for an actinomyces infection, possibly leading to respiratory distress. He underwent a bronchoscopy to obtain cultures and potentially perform a biopsy, but suction issues prevented successful BAL. The patient is still on penicillin for actinomyces, has discontinued levo/clinda, and is receiving high-flow oxygen therapy. Further investigations include urine histo/serum crypto, and he will start on singular and atrovent for his asthma. The patient also has type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which are being managed with appropriate medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening respiratory distress due to actinomyces infection or another superinfection.
2. Malignancy recurrence.
3. Complications related to diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).
4. Hypertension management and potential complications.
5. Asthma exacerbation.
6. Possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Stress ulcer development.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk due to immobilization in the ICU.
9. Nosocomial infections."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer who has undergone a left pneumonectomy. He presents with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough. He was transferred to the MICU for tachypnea and is currently on high-flow oxygen. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and hypertension (HTN). His current vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/42 mmHg to 132/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a medium concentration mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight/obese appearance with mild respiratory distress. He has bronchial breath sounds that are more prominent on the right side, as well as wheezes on the right side. His extremities show trace edema in both lower extremities. The neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL, and sodium level of 140 mg/dL. Other lab values such as creatinine, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphate levels are within normal ranges. The PT/PTT/IN"

   64 yo male with h/o lung ca s/p left pneumonectomy, DM2, HTN, here with
   worsening dyspnea, low grade temps, and productive cough, transferred
   to the MICU for tachypnea.
   # Dypsnea/hypoxia: patient has h/o lung ca, with pneumonectomy, though
   not clear what type.  he had serial imaging subsequently without any
   recurrence, though this summer, CT showed evidence of hilar mass.  His
   thoracic surgeon performed biopsy, but no malignancy was found, and
   they did not feel patient would tolerate VATS.  He had a sputum cx from
   [**Hospital1 966**] which showed actinomyces, which he was not treated for due to the
   fact he was lost to follow up.  His new dyspnea/hypoxia may be further
   worsening of this underlying actinomyces infection, or another
   superinfection on top of that.  Malignancy is also possible, though
   seems less likely.
   - consider bronchoscopy for BAL (culture, cytology, AFB, actinomyces)
   - cont levoflox/clindamycin for treatment of CAP vs aspiration PNA;
   this does provide some coverage for actinomyces though likely not the
   most ideal coverage
   - ID consult for consideration of need for repeat BAL, possibly to
   switch agents (PCN x [**4-14**] wks vs CTX)
   - consider thoracics consult
   - cont high flow O2; no need for BiPap at this time
   - can ABG if patient becomes more somnolent and concern for
   hypercarbia, though initial gas is likely his baseline
   - nebulzier PRN
   - check sputum cx

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of left pneumonectomy in 2015 for lung cancer, presenting with progressive dyspnea, low-grade fevers, and productive cough. He has a right-sided lung mass that was found to be positive for actinomyces. A mediastinoscopy performed in 2016 was negative for malignancy. The patient's current symptoms and findings are consistent with actinomycosis, although confirmation is pending. The patient underwent a fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) yesterday, but due to technical issues, the bronchial washings could only be sent for culture and the airways could not be inspected or perform a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient's respiratory distress has improved with bronchodilators, and his oxygen levels have been maintained at 100%. He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin and penicillin G potassium. He is being closely monitored in the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and tachypnea suggest respiratory distress, which could be due to various causes such as infection, airway obstruction, or complications from his underlying lung condition.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is maintained at 100% with the use of a"

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypotension: This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Oliguria/Anuria: This may indicate acute kidney injury or failure, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to breathe independently may result in further lung complications and decreased oxygenation.
4. Pneumonia: Infection can spread and worsen, potentially leading to sepsis or other systemic infections.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Poor glycemic control can lead to hyperglycemia and associated complications like diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
6. Other complications may arise from the patient's underlying conditions, such as cardiovascular issues or infections.

It is important to monitor the patient closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   HPI:
    Briefly, this is a 64 yo male with h/o lung ca s/p left pneumonectomy
   in [**2125**], and more recently had workup of recurrent lung mass on R side
   at [**Hospital1 966**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10257**] including medisastinoscopy and paraceliac LN
   biopsy which did not show any malignancy.  This was all done in [**7-17**].
   More recently, the patient has had worsening DOE, and he presented to
   the ED on [**2139-1-12**] for productive cough, low grade temps, worsening
   dyspnea, and tachypnea.
   .
   While on the floor, the patient was treated with clindamycin and
   levofloxacin for probably pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonia.  A repeat
   chest CT here showed right sided hilar cavitating mass, and there was
   some evidence of tree and [**Male First Name (un) **] opacities of the right lung.  While on
   the floor, the patient was having increasing tachypnea to the 30s, and
   appeared uncomfortable.  The team was called in to evaluate him for his
   tachypnea, and then requested transfer to the MICU given his
   respiratory status.
   .
   In the MICU, he had a bronch that was limited because of suction
   equipment failure per report but washings were taken.  Antibiotics were
   also changed to penicillin per ID.  He was satting well on 6L
   post-bronch and went back to the floor on [**2139-1-15**].  This morning, he
   underwent repeat bronch by IP bronch.  Findings were significant for
   near occlusion of the RUL bronchus by an airway mass and endobronchial
   biopsy and TBNA were done. He desatted to 80% and was not extubated
   because of his tenuous respiratory status.  Transfer to the MICU was
   then requested.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, including a left pneumonectomy, presenting with worsening dyspnea, low-grade temperatures, and productive cough. He was treated for pneumonia on the floor and then transferred to the MICU due to respiratory failure. In the MICU, he underwent a bronchoscopic procedure that resulted in desaturation and was not extubated because of his tenuous respiratory status. The patient has a history of lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He also has a known actinomyces infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus is likely from metastatic versus de Last Name (un) lung cancer and known actinomyces infection.
2. Actinomyces infection: The patient has a known actinomyces infection, which can cause lung infection and contribute to respiratory failure.
3. Lung cancer: The patient has a history of lung cancer, which may be causing the partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus and contributing to his respiratory symptoms.
4. Pneumonia: The patient was initially treated for pneumonia on the floor, indicating a possible bacterial infection contributing to his respiratory distress.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: Another possibility"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, who has undergone a left pneumonectomy. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of a productive cough, low-grade temperature, worsening dyspnea, and tachypnea. The patient was initially treated with clindamycin and levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. 

Further investigations, including a repeat chest CT scan, revealed a right-sided hilar cavitating mass and some evidence of tree-in-bud opacities in the right lung. The patient's respiratory status continued to deteriorate, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. 

In the ICU, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy that was limited due to suction equipment failure, but washings were still taken. Antibiotics were changed to penicillin as per the ID team. The patient's oxygen saturation improved on 6 liters of oxygen post-bronchoscopy and was eventually extubated. 

However, the patient experienced another episode of respiratory failure and required reintubation. He was placed on invasive ventilation and a PICC line was inserted. 

The patient's vital signs have fluctuated, with low blood pressure and increased heart rate. His respiratory rate has remained elevated. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's condition is complex and requires further evaluation. Potential medical complications that"

    Briefly, this is a 64 yo male with h/o lung ca s/p left pneumonectomy
   in [**2125**], and more recently had workup of recurrent lung mass on R side
   at [**Hospital1 966**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10257**] including medisastinoscopy and paraceliac LN
   biopsy which did not show any malignancy.  This was all done in [**7-17**].
   More recently, the patient has had worsening DOE, and he presented to
   the ED on [**2139-1-12**] for productive cough, low grade temps, worsening
   dyspnea, and tachypnea.
   .
   While on the floor, the patient was treated with clindamycin and
   levofloxacin for probably pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonia.  A repeat
   chest CT here showed right sided hilar cavitating mass, and there was
   some evidence of tree and [**Male First Name (un) **] opacities of the right lung.  While on
   the floor, the patient was having increasing tachypnea to the 30s, and
   appeared uncomfortable.  The team was called in to evaluate him for his
   tachypnea, and then requested transfer to the MICU given his
   respiratory status.
   .
   In the MICU, he had a bronch that was limited because of suction
   equipment failure per report but washings were taken.  Antibiotics were
   also changed to penicillin per ID.  He was satting well on 6L
   post-bronch and went back to the floor on [**2139-1-15**].  This morning, he
   underwent repeat bronch by IP bronch.  Findings were significant for
   near occlusion of the RUL bronchus by an airway mass and endobronchial
   biopsy and TBNA were done. He desatted to 80% and was not extubated
   because of his tenuous respiratory status.  Transfer to the MICU was
   then requested.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, including a left pneumonectomy, who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of respiratory failure, intubation, productive cough, low-grade temperatures, and worsening dyspnea. The patient was treated with clindamycin and levofloxacin for pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. A repeat chest CT showed a right-sided hilar cavitating mass with evidence of tree-in-bud opacities on the right lung. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to a request for transfer to the MICU due to respiratory status.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient experienced hypoxic respiratory failure during a bronchoscopy, resulting in intubation.
2. Partial occlusion of the RUL bronchus: The patient has a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus, likely due to metastatic lung cancer or an actinomyces infection.
3. Actinomyces infection: The patient has a history of actinomyces infection, which was identified in sputum cultures but not treated due to loss of follow-up.
4. Lung cancer: The patient has a history of lung cancer, including a previous left pneumonectomy. A recent CT scan revealed evidence of a hilar mass on the right side, which was biopsied but showed no malignancy. The possibility of recurrent lung cancer is still present.
5. Hypotension"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, the note mentions several significant events that occurred in the 24-hour period. The patient received approximately 2.5 liters of fluid due to borderline systolic blood pressures in the high 80s to low 90s. The patient's urine output was low at 15-25 cc/hr. An echocardiogram showed significant right ventricular dysfunction due to high pulmonary artery pressures, with no left ventricular dysfunction or effusion noted.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and their last dose of antibiotics was penicillin G potassium on [**2139-1-18**] at 04:00 AM. They are currently receiving infusions of fentanyl (concentrate) at 25 mcg/hour and midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour. Other ICU medications and medical and family history remain unchanged from admission.

The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results are also provided in the note. The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, with readings ranging from 91/54 mmHg to 118/68 mmHg. Their heart rate is within normal limits, and their oxygen saturation is consistently above 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance is noted as 33.3 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, and magnesium are slightly abnormal. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

Imaging results reveal improved aeration in the right upper lobe compared to the prior exam, with persisting opacities in the perihilar and right lower lobes. The left hemithorax remains densely opacified. An echocardiogram shows right ventricular cavity enlargement with depressed free wall motion, severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild aortic valve stenosis, preserved global left ventricular systolic function, and no pericardial effusion.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, oliguria/anuria, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is being provided.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He presented with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough. The patient was intubated after experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure during a bronchoscopy and biopsy. Imaging revealed a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus, likely due to metastatic lung cancer or actinomyces infection. The patient also has a history of lung cancer with a pneumonectomy, but the specific type is unclear. Serial imaging showed no recurrence, but a recent CT scan showed evidence of a hilar mass. A thoracic surgeon performed a biopsy, but no malignancy was found. The patient has not been treated for actinomyces infection, which was detected in a sputum culture from a previous hospitalization. The patient's current symptoms are multifactorial, including actinomyces infection and likely lung cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent intubation indicate a risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Lung cancer progression: The presence of a hilar mass and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus suggest the possibility of lung cancer progression.
3. Actinomyces infection: The patient's history of actinomyces infection and untreated status increase the risk of worsening infection.
4. Right ventricular dysfunction: The echocardi"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the
   for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his / her note
   above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: Please see admit note from [**2139-1-12**] and pulmonary consult note on
   [**2139-1-14**] for full details.  Briefly, this is a 64 yo male with h/o lung
   ca s/p left pneumonectomy in [**2125**], and more recently had workup of
   recurrent lung mass on R side at [**Hospital1 966**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10257**] including
   medisastinoscopy and paraceliac LN biopsy which did not show any
   malignancy.  This was all done in [**7-17**].  More recently, the patient has
   had worsening DOE, and he presented to the ED on [**2139-1-12**] for productive
   cough, low grade temps, worsening dyspnea, and tachypnea.
   .
   While on the floor, the patient was treated with clindamycin and
   levofloxacin for probably pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonia.  A repeat
   chest CT here showed right sided hilar cavitating mass, and there was
   some evidence of tree and [**Male First Name (un) **] opacities of the right lung.  While on
   the floor, the patient was having increasing tachypnea to the 30s, and
   appeared uncomfortable.  The team was called in to evaluate him for his
   tachypnea, and then requested transfer to the MICU given his
   respiratory status.
   .
   In the MICU, he had a bronch that was limited because of suction
   equipment failure per report but washings were taken.  Antibiotics were
   also changed to penicillin per ID.  He was satting well on 6L
   post-bronch and went back to the floor on [**2139-1-15**].  This morning, he
   underwent repeat bronch by IP bronch.  Findings were significant for
   near occlusion of the RUL bronchus by an airway mass and endobronchial
   biopsy and transbronchial FNA were done.  He desatted to 80% and was
   not extubated because of his tenuous respiratory status.  Transfer to
   the MICU was then requested.

   Low UOP mildly improved after 2.5L NS. Weaned off pressors. [**Date Range **] showed
   significant RV dysfunction. Switched to AC overnight for tachypnea.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, including a left pneumonectomy, and a recent workup for recurrent lung mass on the right side. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of respiratory failure, including productive cough, low-grade temperatures, and worsening dyspnea. The patient was treated with clindamycin and levofloxacin for possible pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia while on the floor. However, a repeat chest CT showed a right-sided hilar cavitating mass, along with evidence of tree-in-bud opacities in the right lung. While on the floor, the patient experienced increasing tachypnea and discomfort, leading to the request for transfer to the MICU.

In the MICU, the patient underwent a bronchoscopic procedure that was limited due to suction equipment failure, but washings were taken. Antibiotics were changed to penicillin per ID. The patient was extubated and placed on supplemental oxygen. However, he desaturated to 80% during another bronchoscopic procedure and was not extubated due to his tenuous respiratory status. A repeat bronchoscopic evaluation showed near occlusion of the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus by an airway mass, and endobronchial biopsy and transbronchial fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were performed.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's urine output has mildly improved after receiving 2"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He was initially admitted with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the
   for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his / her note
   above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: Please see admit note from [**2139-1-12**] and pulmonary consult note on
   [**2139-1-14**] for full details.  Briefly, this is a 64 yo male with h/o lung
   ca s/p left pneumonectomy in [**2125**], and more recently had workup of
   recurrent lung mass on R side at [**Hospital1 966**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10257**] including
   medisastinoscopy and paraceliac LN biopsy which did not show any
   malignancy.  This was all done in [**7-17**].  More recently, the patient has
   had worsening DOE, and he presented to the ED on [**2139-1-12**] for productive
   cough, low grade temps, worsening dyspnea, and tachypnea.
   .
   While on the floor, the patient was treated with clindamycin and
   levofloxacin for probably pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonia.  A repeat
   chest CT here showed right sided hilar cavitating mass, and there was
   some evidence of tree and [**Male First Name (un) **] opacities of the right lung.  While on
   the floor, the patient was having increasing tachypnea to the 30s, and
   appeared uncomfortable.  The team was called in to evaluate him for his
   tachypnea, and then requested transfer to the MICU given his
   respiratory status.
   .
   In the MICU, he had a bronch that was limited because of suction
   equipment failure per report but washings were taken.  Antibiotics were
   also changed to penicillin per ID.  He was satting well on 6L
   post-bronch and went back to the floor on [**2139-1-15**].  This morning, he
   underwent repeat bronch by IP bronch.  Findings were significant for
   near occlusion of the RUL bronchus by an airway mass and endobronchial
   biopsy and transbronchial FNA were done.  He desatted to 80% and was
   not extubated because of his tenuous respiratory status.  Transfer to
   the MICU was then requested.
   24 Hour Events:
   Low UOP mildly improved after 2.5L NS. Weaned off pressors. TTE showed
   significant RV dysfunction. Switched to AC overnight for tachypnea.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, including a left pneumonectomy, and recurrent lung mass on the right side. He presented to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea, productive cough, and low-grade temperatures. After treatment for probable pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, a repeat chest CT showed a right-sided hilar cavitating mass, and there were opacities in the right lung. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU where he underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed near occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus by an airway mass. Endobronchial biopsy and transbronchial FNA were performed, but the patient desaturated to 80% and was not extubated due to his tenuous respiratory status.

24-hour events include low urine output that improved after fluid administration, weaning off pressors, and significant right ventricular dysfunction shown on TTE. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he remains hypoxemic and hypercapnic despite ventilatory support. His laboratory values show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests.

   Blood pressure still on low side. [**Year (4 digits) **] showed dilated RV with evidence
   of pressure overload (estimated PAP near 90).  Hypoxemia has improved.
   Received substantial volume resuscitation yesterday to enable weaning

   RUL. Vascular pattern to RLL does not seem normal; awaiting formal
   report.  Patient has been started on antibiotics.
   On exam, patient is intubated and awake. Denies dyspnea on ventilator.

   IMP:
   Respiratory failure
   Pneumonia
   Pleural Effusion
   Pulmonary hypertension
   Suspect respiratory failure  due to combination of increased mucus
   production and interstitial edema. The RV overload may be creating a
   condition of diastolic dysfunction in the LV. Thus, achieving a gradual
   negative fluid balance may assist in optimizing cardiac and pulmonary
   function. Try to achieve 0.5 L negative fluid balance today with
   dobutamine and, if necessary, lasix.
   Continue antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, including a left pneumonectomy and recurrent lung mass on the right side. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of productive cough, low-grade fever, and worsening dyspnea. After being treated with clindamycin and levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia, a repeat chest CT showed a right-sided hilar cavitating mass and evidence of tree-in-bud opacities in the right lung.

The patient's condition deteriorated while on the floor, with increasing tachypnea in the 30s and discomfort. He was evaluated by the ICU team and transferred to the MICU due to respiratory status. In the MICU, he underwent a bronchoscopic procedure that was limited due to suction equipment failure, but washings were taken. Antibiotics were changed to penicillin per ID, and he was placed on 6 liters of oxygen post-bronch. He was later extubated but desatted to 80% during another bronchoscopic procedure and was not extubated due to tenuous respiratory status. A repeat bronchoscopic examination revealed near occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus by an airway mass, and endobronchial biopsy and transbronchial fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were performed.

Over the next few days, the patient's vital signs were monitored, and he received various treatments including f"

He was initially admitted with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough. The patient's condition worsened, leading to hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. He underwent a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and other procedures, which improved his oxygen levels. However, he continues to require ventilatory support. His recent CXR shows partial collapse of the right upper lobe bronchus, and there is concern for possible hemorrhage or pulmonary edema. The patient has been diagnosed with right ventricular (RV) failure with pulmonary hypertension. Potential contributing factors include hypovolemia initially, improvement with fluid repletion, heart failure, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a critical condition that requires immediate attention. Continued monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support will be necessary.
2. Hemorrhage: The partial collapse of the right upper lobe bronchus raises concern for possible hemorrhage. Further investigation and management are needed to prevent or control any bleeding.
3. Pulmonary edema: Although there is no clear evidence of pulmonary edema on the recent CXR, it cannot be completely excluded. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and managing fluid balance appropriately is important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer surgery (left pneumonectomy), diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He was admitted with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough. The patient experienced hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure after a bronchoscopy procedure and required mechanical ventilation. His current condition shows improvement in oxygenation but continues to require ventilatory support. The chest X-ray reveals partial collapse of the right upper lobe bronchus and potential hemorrhage. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has low blood pressure due to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, hypotension, and a possible right hilar and lower lobe mass. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and previous lung cancer surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of worsening dyspnea and respiratory failure indicates a potential life-threatening condition. Continued monitoring and management of ventilation support are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. RV Dysfunction and Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's low blood pressure and RV dysfunction suggest compromised cardiac function. This could lead to further hemodynamic instability and right-sided heart failure if not adequately managed.
3. Hilar and Lower Lobe Mass: The presence of a mass in the right hilum and lower lobe raises concerns for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He presented with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough. The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. He had partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus, likely from metastatic lung cancer and known actinomyces infection. The patient attempted diuresis yesterday with dobutamine for blood pressure control but showed minimal response. He was extubated this morning but later self-extubated. The medical team plans to keep the patient extubated today, monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress. They will recheck the arterial blood gas (ABG) this morning after extubation. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, awaiting biopsy, fine-needle aspiration, and culture results. A right upper lobe stent may be necessary in the future. The patient will continue to use a nebulizer on a standing basis and as needed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced episodes of respiratory failure, including hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the patient's condition worsens or if"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He was admitted with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and biopsy, which led to hypoxic respiratory failure and subsequent intubation.

The patient's recent events include experiencing tachypnea and tachycardia, but these resolved after switching from pressure support (PS) to assist-control ventilation (ACV). A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed, showing multifocal opacities consistent with possible pneumonia (PNA) and a new right pleural effusion. The patient was started on antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and received dobutamine to help with diuresis.

The patient self-extubated in the morning but will be closely monitored. If the patient shows signs of fatigue, reintubation may be necessary. The medical team plans to continue the antibiotic treatment for VAP and await biopsy, fine-needle aspiration, and culture results. A right upper lobe (RUL) stent may be required in the future, and nebulizer therapy will be provided as needed.

The patient also has hypotension, which could be due to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, pulmonary artery hypertension, compression of pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy, hypovolemia, or sepsis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient self-extubated this morning and is currently on dobutamine and IV lasix. There has been minimal progress in diuresing despite these interventions. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 123 bpm and low blood pressure ranging from 110/64 to 85/45 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is high at 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 94%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The flow sheet data indicates ongoing fluid overload with a total input of 4,032 mL and output of 855 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,177 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and face tent, and is on continuous mandatory ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 72 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 144. 

The patient's physical examination is incomplete due to the inability to assess peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other vital"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer who underwent a left pneumonectomy. He presented with worsening dyspnea, low-grade temperatures, and a productive cough. The patient was transferred to the MICU after experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure during a bronchoscopy. He has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia (PNA) without evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient's medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and a known infection of actinomyces. There is also a concern for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient self-extubated on 1/11 but was reintubated due to tachypnea. 

The plan includes sending the patient for a rigid bronchoscopy today with frozen sections because of a high suspicion for cancer. Antibiotics will be administered for 4-14 weeks, starting with penicillin, followed by vancomycin and cefepime on day 1, and micafungin on day 1 as well. Path and culture results will be followed up on.

The patient's hypotension is attributed to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, pulmonary artery hypertension, and compression of pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. Hypovolemia and sepsis may also be contributing factors. There is no evidence of PE causing RV overload. Diuresis was performed on"

   biopsy, and desaturation.  Has partial occlusion of RUL bronchus,
   likely from metastatic versus de [**Last Name (un) 5275**] lung cancer and known actinomyces
   infection.  Barriers to extubation likely were secretions and possible
   fluid overload.  There was no evidence of PE on CTA yesterday.
   Attempted diuresis yesterday with dobutamine for BP control, but
   patient was essentially even over 24 hrs.  Patient self extubated this
   AM.
   - will try to keep extubated today, but if patient appears to tire out,
   will reintubate.
   - recheck ABG this AM after extubation
   - continue PCN x [**4-14**] wks (day 1 = [**2139-1-15**])
   - awaiting biopsy, FNA, and culture results
   - will likely need RUL stent in future
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - treat for VAP with vanc/cefepime/cipro; recheck sputum cx.  Will give
   8 day course (day 1= [**2139-1-18**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer and previous left pneumonectomy.
- He presented with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough.
- The patient was transferred to the MICU after experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure during bronchoscopy.
- He has partial occlusion of the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus, likely due to metastatic lung cancer or actinomyces infection.
- The patient attempted self-extubation but was reintubated due to concerns about secretions and possible fluid overload.
- He is currently being treated for multifocal pneumonia, without evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient has diastolic blood pressure in the 90s, making aggressive diuresis difficult.
- The treatment plan includes continued antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), rechecking sputum cultures, and preparing for a rigid bronchoscopy with possible stenting of the bronchus intermedius.
- Other conditions being managed include diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent hypoxic respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or worsening of existing lung conditions.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer and previous left pneumonectomy. He presented with worsening dyspnea, low-grade temperatures, and productive cough, leading to his transfer to the MICU. The patient experienced hypoxic respiratory failure during a bronchoscopy and subsequent desaturation. He has partial occlusion of the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus, likely due to metastatic lung cancer or actinomyces infection. There is also evidence of possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate (HR) of 108 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 104/54 to 125/70 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%, and temperature (Tmax) of 37.8°C.

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of pneumonia and diabetes mellitus type II. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 50% FiO2. The patient is receiving dobutamine and propofol infusions. His fluid balance shows an intake of 2,245 mL and output of 860 mL, with a total positive balance of 1,385 mL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's WBC count has been steadily increasing over the past few days. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may continue to progress without appropriate management.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is significantly reduced, which could be indicative of renal dysfunction or failure.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia may contribute to his current respiratory issues, and there is a possibility of worsening or new infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He presented with worsening dyspnea, low-grade fever, and productive cough. He was transferred to the MICU after experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure during a bronchoscopy. The patient had a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus, likely due to metastatic lung cancer or infection. He also had yeast on lung biopsy, suggesting a possible fungal infection, and signs of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient self-extubated on 1/11 but was reintubated due to tachypnea. A stent was placed in the bronchus intermedius.

The patient's current medications include cefepime, micafungin (considering switching to fluconazole), and nebulizer treatments as needed. Further diuresis has been held due to hypotension. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted this morning. Consultation with oncology is being considered for further treatment options, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or no further therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent intubation indicate respiratory distress and potential complications related to oxygenation.
2. Multifocal pneumonia (PNA): The patient's symptoms and imaging suggest an infection in the lungs, which could lead to further respiratory"

He underwent stent placement in the bronchus intermedius and is currently being treated with antibiotics, including PCN for 4-14 weeks, vanc/cefepime since 1/18, and micafungin since 1/19. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and hypertension (HTN).

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, leading to intubation. This condition requires careful monitoring and management in the ICU.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia without evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). Treatment includes antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation."

- Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
- Heart rate: 97 bpm (with a normal range of 84-123 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 97/54 mmHg (with a normal range of 64-117/46-78 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 16-34 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is on dobutamine infusion at 2 mcg/kg/min and propofol at 10 mcg/kg/min. They are also receiving several antibiotics, including cefipime, metronidazole, and micafungin.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished general appearance, symmetric chest expansion, wheezing on the right side, absent breath sounds on the left side, prolonged expiratory phase, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine, and normal platelet count. Other lab values,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a left pneumonectomy. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of a productive cough, low-grade fever, worsening dyspnea, and tachypnea. He was treated for post-obstructive right lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed a cavitating mass in the right hilum with evidence of tree-in-bud opacities in the right lung. The patient experienced desaturation to 80% during a bronchoscopy, which revealed near occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus by the mass. Endobronchial biopsy and transbronchial fine-needle aspiration were performed. The patient was placed on levophed and started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. He underwent a rigid/flex bronchoscopy that showed poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer, and a stent was placed. The patient was consulted by hematology-oncology and numerous treatment options were discussed, including radiation therapy (XRT). The patient initially declined XRT but later reversed his decision and is being transferred to the radiation oncology department for planned XRT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from non-small cell lung cancer.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension, which may be due to intravascular depletion or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has had decreased urine output, which could be related to hypotension or acute kidney injury.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which may be hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II.
6. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): The patient has confirmed poorly differentiated NSCLC.
7. Actinomycosis: The patient may have actinomycosis infection, which requires treatment with penicillin.
8. Fungal Infection: The patient has a yeast infection in the lung biopsy, and fluconazole is recommended for treatment.
9. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.7 to 2.1, indicating possible pre-renal acute kidney injury due to diuresis and hypotension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, including a left pneumonectomy and recurrent right lung mass. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of a productive cough, low-grade fever, and worsening dyspnea. The patient was treated for post-obstructive right lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed respiratory failure. He underwent bronchoscopy and endobronchial biopsy, which revealed poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, oliguria/anuria, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently being treated for multifocal pneumonia, yeast infection, and potential actinomycosis. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving vasopressor support with levophed. The plan is to transfer the patient to the radiation oncology department for planned XRT (radiation therapy) in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or complications related to extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he requires vasopressor support with levophed. There is a risk of further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output, suggesting renal dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of left pneumonectomy, pulmonary hypertension, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and underwent an emergency bronchoscopy and intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, hypotension, and new-onset diabetes mellitus type II. He also has a yeast infection on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient had a stent placed in the bronchus intermedius. His current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, and oliguria/anuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support, and there is a possibility that he may require a tracheostomy if he is unable to be extubated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is attributed to right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary artery hypertension, and compression of pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. There is a concern for intravascular depletion, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's decreased urine output could indicate kidney dysfunction or pre-renal azotemia due to hypovolemia.
4. NSCLC: The patient has confirmed poorly differentiated carcinoma, and further treatment planning includes radiation oncology and hematology consultation.

   multifocal PNA, hypotension and new diagnosis of [**Hospital 10400**] transfered to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for planned XRT in AM.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Pt has yeast on lung bx and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**]
   NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole per ID recs
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - Will need to discuss long term possibility of trach if pt unable to
   come of vent
   - will likely need diuresis with dobutamine, will hold on diuresis
   today
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.
   - XRT and mapping in AM
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care
   # Hypotension: Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE with
   RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.
   - fluid bolus PRN to keep MAPs >65, avoid levophed if able
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Basline Cr 0.7 to 2.1, in last 24hrs has bumped from 0.8 to 2.1.
   as UOP has gone to zero. Given that patient was being diuresed, this
   could be pre-renal.  More likely etiology is CIN from dye load 4 days
   ago.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who is currently in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a left pneumonectomy and has pulmonary hypertension due to mass effect from the NSCLC. He was intubated during a bronchoscopy and biopsy, and now has a stent in the bronchus intermedius. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, likely due to NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure.

The patient's current medications include cefepime, flagyl, and fluconazole as per ID recommendations. Nebulizer treatment is given standing and as needed. There is a plan to discuss the possibility of tracheostomy if the patient is unable to come off the ventilator. Dobutamine will be considered, but diuresis will be held for today.

The patient has confirmed NSCLC on biopsy, which is poorly differentiated. Radiation and oncology consultations will follow. XRT and mapping are planned in the morning.

The patient has intermittent hypotension and requires levophed. A recent TTE shows right ventricular dysfunction and remarkable pulmonary artery hypertension. Compression of the pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy is evident. Differential diagnoses include intravascular depletion (as indicated by a bump in creatinine and decreased urine output following diuresis), and less likely septic shock or adrenal insufficiency.

Fluid bolus will be given as needed to keep mean arterial pressures (MAPs) >65, avoiding levophed if possible.

The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, which increased to 2.1 in the last 24 hours, along with zero urine output. This could be pre-renal or possibly contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from a dye load 4 days ago.

Urine electrolytes and sediment analysis will be done to rule out acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Diuresis will be considered when creatinine improves.

The patient's goals of care include limited XRT to enable extubation and allow time to treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and penicillin for potential actinomycosis from a previous infection at another hospital. The patient is undecided about having anything beyond a limited XRT course.

The patient's code status is full code."

   64M s/p left pneumonectomy, pulmonary HTN [**2-10**] to mass effect here with
   hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of bronchospy now with
   multifocal PNA, hypotension and new diagnosis of [**Hospital 10400**] transfered to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for planned XRT in AM.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Pt has yeast on lung bx and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**]
   NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole per ID recs
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - Will need to discuss long term possibility of trach if pt unable to
   come of vent
   - will likely need diuresis with dobutamine, will hold on diuresis
   today
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.
   - XRT and mapping in AM
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care
   # Hypotension: Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE with
   RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.
   - fluid bolus PRN to keep MAPs >65, avoid levophed if able
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Basline Cr 0.7 to 2.1, in last 24hrs has bumped from 0.8 to 2.1.
   as UOP has gone to zero. Given that patient was being diuresed, this
   could be pre-renal.  More likely etiology is CIN from dye load 4 days
   ago.
   - Urine Lytes
   - Urine Sediment to r/o ATN
   - will consider diuresis when creatinine improves

   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  We
   discussed tracheostomy as potential maneuver at some point.  Pt is
   undecided whether would want anything beyond limited XRT course.""

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated after desaturation during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus due to NSCLC. The patient also has yeast on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient underwent stenting of the bronchus intermedius and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II (DM2), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various medications including cefepime, metronidazole, fluconazole, famotidine, and others.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
- Heart rate: 95 bpm (84-108 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 96/53 mmHg (63-132/46-95 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (11-33 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on FiO2 50%

The patient's laboratory results show the following abnormalities:
- White blood cell count: 7.2-7.7 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 29.2-32.8%
- Platelet count: 142-164 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.7-2.1 mg/dL
- Glucose: 75-117 mg/dL
- Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
- Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
- Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include the following diagnoses:
1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
2. Hypotension (not shock)
3. Pneumonia, other
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
5. Oliguria/Anuria
6. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung
7. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension caused by lymphadenopathy
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) from contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) or pre-renal azotemia
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemia
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of left pneumonectomy, pulmonary hypertension, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure following a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. The patient has a known partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC, yeast on lung biopsy, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He recently underwent stenting of the bronchus intermedius. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including NSCLC, VAP, and right heart failure.

The patient has confirmed NSCLC on biopsy, which is poorly differentiated. He has received one session of external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and will continue with further sessions as planned. The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased from 0.8 to 3 in the past 72 hours, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from a previous dye load. Further evaluation of urine electrolytes and sediment is needed to rule out acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal dosing of medications is necessary.

The patient also presents with hypotension, requiring intermittent use of levophed. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed right ventricular dysfunction and remarkable pulmonary artery hypertension, likely due to compression of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of left pneumonectomy, pulmonary hypertension, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which occurred during a bronchoscopy and biopsy procedure. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia (PNA), hypotension, and a new diagnosis of kidney injury (evidenced by an increase in creatinine levels). He was previously transferred from Hospital 10400 to Hospital Unit 10 for planned radiation therapy (XRT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. This condition may be multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and immunocompromised state, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient has already shown signs of yeast infection in the lung biopsy, which suggests a possible fungal superinfection.
3. Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, but it has increased to 2.1 in the last 24 hours. This could be indicative of acute kidney injury (AKI), possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from the recent XRT or pre-renal azotemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure. He underwent a left pneumonectomy and was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and has been treated with antibiotics, antifungal medication, and diuretics. He also has diabetes mellitus type II and is scheduled to receive radiation therapy. The patient's medical team is discussing the possibility of tracheostomy if extubation is not possible.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension, which may be due to various factors such as sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or medication side effects. This can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have significantly increased from 0.8 to 3.1 in the past 96 hours, indicating acute renal failure. This may be caused by factors such as contrast-induced nephropathy ("

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 6551**] and reviewed his historical, lab, and
   imaging data.  I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8092**]
s note above, and agree with his
   findings and plan of care.  The patient is sadly in a difficult
   predicament with his being s/p left pneumonectomy in the past for lung
   ca, and now has a new right lung  endobroncially obstructing NSCLC
   which has contributed to post obstructive pneumonia in a substantial
   portion of his remaining right lung. He
s had an endobronchial stent
   placed by IP and is on broad spectrum antibiotics while he undergoes
   XRT in an effort to open up his right lung airways. We are supporting
   him for now aggressively with antibiotics, XRT, mech ventilator, etc.
   He also has pulm htn and the tumor abuts the pulmonary artery, so we
   can only hope there is no invasion into the pulmonary artery.  He has
   likely contrast induced renal insufficiency, so we are trying to avoid
   further renal insult or dehydration.  Ethical issues and patient
   wishes are as per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8092**]
s note above
   40 min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is indicated by the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. This could be due to multifactorial causes such as NSCLC, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), and right heart CHF/hypervolemia.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia, which is likely multifocal given the underlying NSCLC and previous bronchoscopy.

3. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent episodes of hypotension, requiring the use of vasopressors like levophed. This may be attributed to intravascular volume depletion, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient also has pulmonary hypertension and compression of pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine levels have increased from 0.8 to 3.1 over the past 96 hours, suggesting a possible AKI. This could be due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from recent dye load or pre-renal azotemia secondary to diuresis.

5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2): The patient has a new diagnosis of DM2, which requires appropriate management and monitoring.

6. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is experiencing decreased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient received radiation therapy on 01/23/2139 at 11:24 AM, which may have contributed to the hypotension and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies, but no known drug allergies. Antibiotics were administered on 01/24/2139, including fluconazole, metronidazole, and cefepime. The patient is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, furosemide, famotidine, and heparin sodium. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is sedated and intubated on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 28 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.4, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, and PaO2 of 60 mmHg. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchi on auscultation"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Pt has yeast on lung bx and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**]
   NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF/hypervolemia.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole per ID recs

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and yeast infection on lung biopsy. He was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has received two sessions of external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and is planned for a third session today.

The patient's arterial line was placed this morning and he was hypotensive, requiring 500 cc fluid resuscitation. He did not respond to lasix drip. His current vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 90 bpm, blood pressure 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 95% on FiO2 50%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new onset edema in both lower extremities. His physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema of 2+, left lower extremity edema of 2+, and warm skin. Neurologic assessment shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to stimulation, sedated, movement not assessed,"

The patient's arterial line was placed this morning and he was found to be hypotensive. He required 40mg IV lasix but did not respond to the lasix drip. The patient tolerated his third session of XRT well and his ABG results are essentially unchanged from the previous day.

The patient has been started on a lasix drip with the goal of negative one liter fluid balance. He has been receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. Other medications include famotidine (Pepcid), furosemide (Lasix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of pneumonia. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/53 mmHg to 119/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 6551**] and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8988**]
s note above
   and I agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 6551**] is quite
   awake today, communicating by writing that he has left shoulder pain.
   On exam there seems to be tenderness along course of vein in LUE for
   which we will obtain UE Doppler.  But also he has exquisite tenderness
   along bicipital groove and I wonder if he might have tendonitis there.
   We will call rheumatololgy to come see and evaluate him.
   He continues to have lots of purulent secretions and rhonchi and to
   easily tire on lesser (PSV) forms of vent support.  Hopefully as he
   opens up his Rt bronchus intermedius and as secretions empty our and
   thin out, he will be able to proceed to vent independence and
   extubation.  That may well require a few more days of XRT, antibiotics
   and vent support and suctioning.  For now we will keep I=O as he seems
   intravascularly euvolemic (though admittedly he is third spacing a fair
   amount of fluid).
   40 min spent in the care of this critically ill patient

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated due to desaturation during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC. The patient also has yeast on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and has not been assessed for neurological status. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 291 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, sodium of 127 mg/dL, potassium of 3.1 mg/dL, creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 126 mg/dL. The patient's urine output has been low, with a total output of 1,046 mL over the past 24 hours. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including cefepime, metronidazole, fluconazole, midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, and lasix. 

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and tenderness along the course of the vein in the left upper extremity. 

The patient's goals of care include limited XRT to enable extubation, treatment for yeast and potential actinomycosis from a previous infection, and consideration of tracheostomy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, worsening of edema and fluid overload, development of renal dysfunction, and progression of cancer."

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient has received three sessions of external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and has confirmed NSCLC with poorly differentiated carcinoma. The plan is to continue with scheduled XRT and discuss long-term possibilities of tracheostomy if the patient is unable to be extubated.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level from 0.8 to 3.1 mg/dL in the past 96 hours, which could be due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from dye load. The patient has been"

   Pressure support overnight.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole per ID recs
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - Will need to discuss long term possibility of trach if pt unable to

   # Hypotension: Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE with
   RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Hypotensive overnight,  [**2-10**]

   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation, and was found to have partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus due to NSCLC. The patient also has yeast on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient received a stent to the bronchus intermedius and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and low oxygen saturation. The patient has been given multiple doses of IV lasix without response. The arterial line was placed this morning, and the patient required 500cc of fluid resuscitation due to hypotension. The patient tolerated the third session of X-ray therapy well.

The patient has been on various medications, including cefepime, metronidazole, fluconazole, midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, and furosemide. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with known partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus due to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure and underwent intubation. He also has a yeast infection on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been placed on a stent to the bronchus intermedius. 

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure, indicating hypotension. The arterial line was placed this morning and the patient required 500cc of fluid resuscitation after being hypotensive. Despite receiving IV lasix, the patient did not respond to the lasix drip. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including cefepime, Flagyl, and fluconazole per ID recommendations. Nebulizer treatment is being given standing and as needed. The possibility of tracheostomy has been discussed if the patient is unable to come off the ventilator. 

The patient's NSCLC has been confirmed on biopsy and he has received two sessions of external beam radiation therapy (XRT). A third session of XRT is planned today or on [**2139-1-27**]. 

The patient's baseline creatinine level has risen from 0.8 to 3.1 in the past 96 hours. This could be due to pre-renal causes or contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from the dye load. The patient continues to be difficult to diurese due to hypertension, and it is planned to try pressors with a high-level lasix drip. 

The patient has been intermittently requiring levophed for hypotension. The recent TTE showed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and remarkable pulmonary artery (PA) hypertension. Compression of pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy is suspected. Differential diagnosis includes intravascular depletion and less likely septic shock or adrenal insufficiency. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxic respiratory failure necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. This condition can lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. NSCLC: The patient's confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer increases the risk of local recurrence, metastasis, and potential complications related to treatment such as radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis.
3. VAP: Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can be a severe infection and potentially lead to sepsis.
4. Right heart failure (RHF): The patient's RV dysfunction and PA hypertension suggest the possibility of RHF. This condition can result in poor oxygenation, hypotension, and even cardiogenic shock.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The significant rise in the patient's creatinine levels indicates possible AK"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Pt has yeast on lung bx and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**]
   NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe PA HTN. Barriers to
   extubation are copious secretions and right heart failure.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole per ID recs
   - digoxin load to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure
   - hold off diuresis and pressors given hypothesis that pt needs higher
   preload
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - PSV trial 20/8 now
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received three
   sessions of XRT.  Plan for fourth Tuesday.
   - XRT as scheduled
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care, esp re: trach
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Continues to be
   difficult to diurese [**2-10**] to hypotension, indicating necessary increased
   preload.
   - goal slightly positive today, bolus in order to maintian MAP>65
   - Urine Lytes
 FeUrea
 26.2
   - Urine Sediment to r/o ATN
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE with
   RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Right heart failure is likely
   causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output
   despite normal EF percentage.
   - avoid sedation
   - TBB positive, digoxin as above
   ..
   # DM2:
   - ISS
   .
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  We
   discussed tracheostomy as potential maneuver at some point.  Pt is
   undecided whether would want anything beyond limited XRT course.""

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with known partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient has been intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and also has yeast on lung biopsy, indicating a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension (PA HTN) and right heart failure (CHF), which are contributing to the respiratory failure.

The patient's current medications include cefepime, flagyl, and fluconazole, as per ID recommendations. Digoxin has been initiated to improve cardiac output in the setting of decreased preload from right heart failure. Diuretics and pressors have been held off due to the hypothesis that the patient needs higher preload.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactic acid levels. Renal function tests reveal a slight increase in creatinine (Cr) levels. Liver function tests are within normal range. Microbiology results indicate negative sputum culture for common organisms.

The patient's goals of care include receiving a limited course of radiation therapy (XRT) to potentially enable extubation and treat pulmonary infections. The patient is undecided about having a tracheostomy at this time.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening right heart failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute kidney injury (AKI"

   bronchus from NSCLC. Pt has yeast on lung bx and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**]
   NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe PA HTN. Barriers to
   extubation are copious secretions and right heart failure.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole per ID recs
   - digoxin load to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure
   - hold off diuresis and pressors given hypothesis that pt needs higher
   preload
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - PSV trial 20/8 now
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received three
   sessions of XRT.  Plan for fourth Tuesday.
   - XRT as scheduled
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care, esp re: trach
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Continues to be

   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Right heart failure is likely

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and
   agree with her findings and plan of care.
   Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] remains very alert and cooperative, reasonably comfortable
   but understandably distressed about his predicament.  He has shown
   significant volume sensitivity with any attempts to diurese him met
   with falling BP.  With his PASP of 90 at rest  and his dilated
   hyokinetic RV on echo I suspect he has cor pulmonale and has decreased
   LV preload due to poor forward RV output.  I read his CT scan last week
   as showing RUL pneumonia and showing Rt lung mass, not so much any
   pulmonary edema.  Thus I would give him back some fluid and try digoxin
   (as an RV inotrope).
   He was intubated during bronch with some bleeding so I am hopeful he
   can be extubated soon, esp if his secretions improve a bit more.  I
   would rebronch him prior to any extubation attempt, in an effort to
   reassess his airway and bronchus intermedius stent. It might be
   desirable to talk to IP service and see if they agree and would want to
   be present during such bronch.
   The patient
s CT shows extensive tumor in his Rt lung, including
   occluding RUL bronchus and seemingly invading his Rt PA in more than
   one location.  As such his prognosis is much in question and it would
   be nice to discuss this further with the patient extubated and able to
   better communicate.
   For now we will continue with vent support, giving him another PSV
   trial and also continuing antibiotics.
   45 min spent in the care of this critically ill patient

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to desaturation and bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient has yeast on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Barriers to extubation include copious secretions and right heart failure.

2. Right heart failure: The patient has RV dysfunction and remarkable pulmonary artery hypertension (PA HTN). This is likely causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output, despite normal ejection fraction percentage. Avoid sedation and digoxin as above are mentioned in the plan.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible AKI. This could be due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from dye load or decreased urine output following diuresis. Renal dosing of medications is mentioned in the plan.

4. Pulmonary infection: The patient has yeast on lung biopsy and possible VAP. Antibiotics are being continued per ID recommendations. Fluconazole is being used to treat yeast infection, and penicillin is being considered for potential actinomycosis from previous chest x-ray at Hospital1.

5. NSCLC: The patient's lung mass is confirmed as poorly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated due to desaturation during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC. The patient also has yeast on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A stent was placed in the bronchus intermedius. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including NSCLC, VAP, and right heart failure with severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PA HTN). 

The patient has confirmed NSCLC, which is poorly differentiated and will be treated with radiation oncology and hematology consultations. The patient received three sessions of XRT and plans for the fourth session on Tuesday. 

The patient's hypotension and acute renal failure are likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from dye load. The patient's creatinine is slowly improving, and the goal is to diuresis even today with lasix 20 mg IV Q8. 

The patient's right heart failure is causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output despite normal ejection fraction percentage. The patient's hypernatremia is due to a free water deficit of 3 liters, and free water flushes with TF will be increased today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, biopsy, and stent placement in the bronchus intermedius. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 97/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on digoxin, cefepime, flagyl, and fluconazole. 

The patient has several medical complications including pneumonia, acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, malignancy (lung cancer), diabetes mellitus type II, and right heart failure. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated potassium levels, and decreased hemoglobin and platelet count.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure.
   - Continue cefepime, flagyl, and fluconazole.
   - Consider lasix 20 mg IV Q8 to attempt goal Is/Os even for 24 hours.
   - Nebulizer standing and PRN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was started on digoxin due to presumed right heart failure leading to poor filling and lower left output. This seemed to improve blood pressures. The patient did well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but stopped bolusing for marginal low mean airway pressures since arterial line readings were not accurate and non-invasive readings were higher. 

24-hour events include the initiation of midazolam and fentanyl infusions, the administration of fluconazole, cefepime, and metronidazole, as well as the insertion of a Foley catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/49 to 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on FiO2 50%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 63 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 146.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, right lower extremity edema of 2+, left lower extremity edema of 2+, warm skin, attentive mental status with orientation to time, place, and person, and non-assessment of movement, tone, and cranial nerves. 

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 34200/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 129 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 129 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L, hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 8.2 mg/dL, and acute kidney injury with an elevated serum creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RUL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation trial.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependent.  Now volume expanded.  Plan to monitor BP, maintian MAP >60
   mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- increase free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Plan local XRT to right
   hilum.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to sustain
   extubation.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   No plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia in the right upper lobe (RUL). This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and increased risk of infection.

2. Obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung: There is an obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung, which may be causing further respiratory compromise.

3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which is likely contributing to the respiratory failure. This condition can lead to right heart strain and failure.

4. Right heart failure: The patient's hypotension is partly attributed to right heart failure. This condition can result in poor perfusion and organ dysfunction.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which means an abnormally high level of sodium in the blood. This condition can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not managed appropriately.

6. Lung cancer: The patient has non-small cell lung cancer with poor prognosis. Local XRT (radiotherapy) to the right hilum is planned, and consideration for chemotherapy will be made if the patient can sustain extubation.

7. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure, possibly due to the administration of contrast dye. Ren"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RUL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependent.  Now volume expanded.  Plan to monitor BP, maintian MAP >60
   mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- increase free water.  Monitro serial Na+.
   LUNG CANCER -- NON-SMALL CELL,
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE --
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Pt has yeast on lung bx and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**]
   NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe PA HTN. Barriers to
   extubation are copious secretions and right heart failure.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole per ID recs
   - digoxin load to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure
   - hold off diuresis and pressors given hypothesis that pt needs higher
   preload
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - PSV trial 20/8 now
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received three
   sessions of XRT.  Plan for fourth Tuesday.
   - XRT as scheduled
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care, esp re: trach
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Continues to be
   difficult to diurese [**2-10**] to hypotension, indicating necessary increased
   preload.
   - goal slightly positive today, bolus in order to maintian MAP>65
   - Urine Lytes
 FeUrea
 26.2
   - Urine Sediment to r/o ATN
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE with
   RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Right heart failure is likely
   causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output
   despite normal EF percentage.
   - avoid sedation
   - TBB positive, digoxin as above

   # DM2:
   - ISS

   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  We
   discussed tracheostomy as potential maneuver at some point.  Pt is
   undecided whether would want anything beyond limited XRT course.""

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, hypotension, hypernatremia, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient has been intubated due to bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. There is a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient also has yeast on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A stent has been placed in the bronchus intermedius.

The patient's current condition includes right heart failure, severe pulmonary hypertension, and an obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 102/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume of 400 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O.

The patient has been diagnosed with NSCLC, confirmed by biopsy. The pathology report indicates poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient has received three sessions of radiation therapy (XRT) and plans for the fourth session on Tuesday. The patient's goals of care include limited XRT to potentially enable extubation and treatment"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Pt has yeast on lung bx and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**]
   NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe PA HTN. Barriers to
   extubation are copious secretions and right heart failure.  High peak
   pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance -> tumor +/-
   secretions.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole, today day [**7-22**]
   - cont digoxin to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure, level therapeutic
   - cont lasix gtt
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - PSV trial daily
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received three
   sessions of XRT.  Plan for fifth session today.
   - XRT as scheduled today -> re: response, may see symptomatic
   improvement in [**7-18**] days, +/- radiographic improvement
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care, esp re: trach; Quenn will be in this
   afternoon
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Continues to be
   difficult to diurese [**2-10**] to hypotension, indicating necessary increased
   preload.   Creatinine slowly improving
   - goal even today, lasix gtt as above
   - repeat urine lytes suggest pre-renal or CIN
   - renally dose meds
   - Q6 lytes during diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension/CHF: Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE
   with RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Right heart failure is likely
   causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output
   despite normal EF percentage.
   - avoid sedation
   - TBB even, digoxin and diuresis as above, check dig level
   ..
   #  Hypernatremia:  Free water deficit 3 liters.  Will increase free
   water flushes with TF today.
   .
   # DM2:
   - ISS
   .
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  We
   discussed tracheostomy as potential maneuver at some point.  Pt is
   undecided whether would want anything beyond limited XRT course.""

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation, and was found to have a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC. The patient also has yeast on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient has received three sessions of external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and is scheduled for a fourth session today. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including NSCLC, VAP, and right heart failure with severe pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient's high peak inspiratory pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance, which may be due to tumor and/or secretions. 

The patient has oliguria/anuria, acute renal failure (ARF), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2), and a history of cancer. The patient's current medications include cefepime, Flagyl, fluconazole, and digoxin. 

The patient's labs show elevated levels of sodium (146 mEq/L), creatinine (2.5 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (67 mg/dL), and glucose (135 mg/dL). The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, but there is an increase in platelet count.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient received his fourth session of radiation therapy (XRT) today and may show symptomatic improvement within 7-20 days. The patient's urine sodium (FeNa) and urine osmolarity (Uosm) indicate pre-renal azotemia and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The patient's peak inspiratory pressures are in the mid-high 40s, suggesting airway resistance. The patient has been on furosemide (Lasix) infusion since admission. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 128/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is 104.9 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,569 mL and output of 1,110 mL. 

Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist/control mode, tidal volume set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O, and positive inspiratory pressure ("

   stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**]
   NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe PA HTN. Barriers to
   extubation are copious secretions and right heart failure.  High peak
   pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance -> tumor +/-
   secretions.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole, today day [**7-22**]
   - cont digoxin to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure, level therapeutic

   sessions of XRT.  Plan for fifth session today.
   - XRT as scheduled today -> re: response, may see symptomatic
   improvement in [**7-18**] days, +/- radiographic improvement

   - goal even today, lasix gtt as above
   - repeat urine lytes suggest pre-renal or CIN
   - renally dose meds
   - Q6 lytes during diuresis

   # Hypotension/CHF:  Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE
   with RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Right heart failure is likely
   causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output
   despite normal EF percentage.  Currently tolerating diuresis.

   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and desaturation during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus due to NSCLC. The patient has been intubated and received four sessions of external beam radiation therapy (XRT). He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition includes high peak inspiratory pressures with lower plateaus, suggesting resistance, possibly due to the tumor and secretions. He is also suffering from hypernatremia and right heart failure with severe pulmonary artery hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including NSCLC, VAP, and right heart failure. Barriers to extubation include copious secretions and right heart failure.
2. NSCLC: The patient has confirmed NSCLC, which is poorly differentiated carcinoma. He has received three sessions of XRT and is scheduled for a fifth session today. Symptomatic improvement may be seen in approximately 18 days, with or without radiographic improvement.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated after experiencing desaturation during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus due to NSCLC. The patient also has a yeast infection on lung biopsy and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A stent has been placed in the bronchus intermedius. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including NSCLC, VAP, and right heart failure with severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PA HTN). 

The patient has confirmed NSCLC and has received three sessions of external beam radiation therapy (XRT). The plan is to continue with scheduled XRT sessions. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level, and is likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from dye load. The patient is difficult to diurese due to hypotension, indicating necessary increased preload. 

The patient has intermittent hypotension and right heart failure (CHF), which is likely causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output. 

The patient is hypernatremic with a free water deficit of approximately 3 liters. 

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RUL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation trial.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependent.  Now volume expanded.  Plan to monitor BP, maintian MAP >60
   mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA --Improved.  Continue to provide free water.  Monitror
   serial Na+.
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Plan local XRT to right
   hilum.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to sustain
   extubation.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   No plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.  Monitor BUN,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  HOpe
   to promote gentle net diuresis to mobilize fluids.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. The primary obstacles include pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung (post stent), pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is attributed to right heart failure. The plan is to monitor the blood pressure and maintain the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels have improved. The plan is to provide free water and monitor serial sodium levels.

4. Lung Cancer: The patient has non-small cell lung cancer with a poor prognosis. The plan is to provide local X-ray therapy to the right hilum, and oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if the patient is able to sustain extubation.

5. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which is attributed to previous left pneumonectomy and now tumor involvement of the right pulmonary artery.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure due to an intravenous contrast dye load. There are no plans for active net diuresis, and renal dose medications will be given. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels will be monitored.

7. Fluid Overload:"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RUL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation trial.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependent.  Now volume expanded.  Plan to monitor BP, maintian MAP >60
   mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA --Improved.  Continue to provide free water.  Monitror
   serial Na+.
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Plan local XRT to right
   hilum.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to sustain
   extubation.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   No plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.  Monitor BUN,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  HOpe
   to promote gentle net diuresis to mobilize fluids.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, hypotension, hypernatremia, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, and fluid overload. They are currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer with poor prognosis, which may require local XRT and chemotherapy if able to sustain extubation. The patient also has a history of NIDDM and is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure indicate potential cardiac issues. There is a risk of further cardiac deterioration or cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately. Fluid overload and hypernatremia need to be closely monitored and managed.
4. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay, there is an increased risk of nosocomial infections such as VAP and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Lung Cancer Progression: Despite ongoing treatment, the patient's lung cancer may continue to progress, leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and decreased overall prognosis.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  High peak pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance ->
   tumor +/- secretions.
   - completes 8 day course of Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole
   - cont digoxin to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure, level therapeutic
   - cont lasix gtt, and neo for pressor support, goal  (-) 1-2 liters
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - PSV trial daily
   .
   # AF with RVR: Pt first entered AF yesterday. Sponateneously converted.
   Suspected enlarged and dilated right atrium with volume overload were
   predisposing. Began more aggressive diuresis and has remained largely
   in sinus overnight.
   - cont Lasix gtt and neo
   - diltiazem prn for AF with RVR
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received three
   sessions of XRT.  Plan for fifth session today.
   - XRT as rescheduled today -> re: response, may see symptomatic
   improvement in [**7-18**] days, +/- radiographic improvement
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care, esp re: trach
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Creatinine slowly
   improving.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - goal 1-2L negative
   - renally dose meds
   - TID lytes during diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension/CHF:  Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE
   with RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Right heart failure is likely
   causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output
   despite normal EF percentage.  Currently on neo to enable diuresis.
   - limit sedation as appropriate
   - neo as above
   ..
   #  Hypernatremia:  Free water deficit initially ~3 liters.  Improving
   with frequent free water.
   - decrease free water flushes to 200cc q4h and monitor TID lytes
   .
   # DM2:
   - ISS
   .
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  We
   discussed tracheostomy as potential maneuver at some point.  Pt is
   undecided whether would want anything beyond limited XRT course.""

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  High peak pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance ->
   tumor +/- secretions.
   - Cont Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole, today day [**8-22**]
   - cont digoxin to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure, level therapeutic
   - cont lasix gtt, and neo for pressor support, goal  (-) 2 liters
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - PSV trial daily
   .
   # AF with RVR: Pt first entered AF yesterday. Sponateneously converted.
   Suspected enlarged and dilated right atrium with volume overload were
   predisposing. Began more aggressive diuresis and has remained largely
   in sinus overnight.
   - cont Lasix gtt and neo
   - diltiazem prn for AF with RVR
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received three
   sessions of XRT.  Plan for fifth session today.
   - XRT as rescheduled today -> re: response, may see symptomatic
   improvement in [**7-18**] days, +/- radiographic improvement
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care, esp re: trach
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Creatinine slowly
   improving.
   - appreciate renal recs- consider albumin with lasix
   - goal 2l -
   - renally dose meds
   - Q6 lytes during diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension/CHF:  Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE
   with RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Right heart failure is likely
   causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output
   despite normal EF percentage.  Currently on neo to enable diuresis.
   - limit sedation as appropriate
   - neo as above
   ..
   #  Hypernatremia:  Free water deficit initially ~3 liters.  Improving
   with frequent free water
   - decrease free water flushes to 250cc q4h
   .
   # DM2:
   - ISS
   .
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  We
   discussed tracheostomy as potential maneuver at some point.  Pt is
   undecided whether would want anything beyond limited XRT course.""

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of flipped into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) on his first trip to external radiation therapy (XRT) and dropped systolic blood pressures to the 70s on his second treatment, requiring fluid bolus. The patient was discussed with Pat, and it was decided to diurese and support with phenylephrine.

The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has undergone three sessions of XRT. The plan for the fifth session today was rescheduled due to response evaluation. The patient's goals of care include considering tracheostomy at some point, as per the meeting with Dr. [Last Name (Title) 323] on [1-21].

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to desaturation during bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC. The failure is likely multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN) due to right heart failure.

2. AFib with RVR: The patient spontaneously converted from atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Suspected enlarged and dilated right atrium with volume overload were predisposing factors. Ag"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation trial.  Reduce
   sedation during daytime.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependent.  Now volume expanded.  Plan to monitor BP, maintian MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   HYPERNATREMIA --Improved.  Continue to provide free water.  Monitror
   serial Na+.
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Plan local XRT to right
   hilum.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to sustain
   extubation.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Hope
   to promote gentle net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip and
   vasopressor as needed.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to multifactorial respiratory failure including pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the right lung, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 113/61 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer with poor prognosis, and plans are being made for local XRT to the right hilum. The patient also has severe pulmonary hypertension attributed to a previous left pneumonectomy and now with tumor involvement of the right pulmonary artery.

Other medical complications include acute renal failure likely attributable to intravenous contrast dye load, hypernatremia, and hypotension in part attributed to right heart failure. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and is being monitored for glycemic control with a target glucose level below 150.

The patient is currently receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, furosemide, phenylephrine, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels, along with low potassium and sodium levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation trial.  Reduce
   sedation during daytime.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependent.  Now volume expanded.  Plan to monitor BP, maintian MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   HYPERNATREMIA --Improved.  Continue to provide free water.  Monitror
   serial Na+.
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Plan local XRT to right
   hilum.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to sustain
   extubation.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Hope
   to promote gentle net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip and
   vasopressor as needed.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has copious oral secretions and experiences intermittent atrial fibrillation. They have a history of pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung with stenting, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. The patient also has hypotension, hypernatremia, lung cancer (non-small cell), pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care. The medical team is planning to continue mechanical ventilation, empirical antimicrobials, monitoring ABG, reducing sedation during daytime, monitoring BP and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg with vasopressor as needed, providing free water to correct hypernatremia, considering local XRT to the right hilum, evaluating chemotherapy options, promoting gentle net diuresis to mobilize fluids, and maintaining glucose levels <150.

The patient has a PICC line and an arterial line in place. Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis with boots and systemic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head of bed elevation. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  XRT
   started [**1-22**], 8 days ago we were told by rad-onc that if we would see
   improvement it would be at 7-10 days from initiation.  Patient has
   repeatedly refused trach.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  High peak pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance ->
   tumor +/- secretions.
   - d/c
d abx
   - cont digoxin to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure, level therapeutic
   - cont lasix gtt, and neo for pressor support, goal  (-) 1-2 liters
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - Continue weaning trials
   .
   # AF with RVR: looks like still in AF, no RVR

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). They have also received antibiotics to treat a potential pulmonary infection.

2. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/69 mmHg to 81/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

3. The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission, and they are intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. They have been given a tracheostomy (trach) but have repeatedly refused it.

4. The patient has undergone stenting of the right upper lobe bronchus intermedius due to partial occlusion caused by NSCLC. They continue to experience respiratory failure, likely due to multifactorial causes including VAP, right heart failure, and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.

5. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation without rapid ventricular response.

6. The patient's kidney function is compromised, with an elevated creatinine level, which is improving slowly. They have received renal dosing of medications.

7. The patient has hypotension and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction, possibly secondary to cardiac tampon"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  We
   discussed tracheostomy as potential maneuver at some point.  Pt is
   undecided whether would want anything beyond limited XRT course.""
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  High peak pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance ->
   tumor +/- secretions.
   - completes 8 day course of Cefepime, Flagyl, Fluconazole
   - cont digoxin to improve cardiac output in setting of decreased
   preload from right heart failure, level therapeutic
   - cont lasix gtt, and neo for pressor support, goal  (-) 1-2 liters
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - PSV trial daily
   .
   # AF with RVR: Pt first entered AF yesterday. Sponateneously converted.
   Suspected enlarged and dilated right atrium with volume overload were
   predisposing. Began more aggressive diuresis and has remained largely
   in sinus overnight.
   - cont Lasix gtt and neo
   - diltiazem prn for AF with RVR
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received three
   sessions of XRT.  Plan for fifth session today.
   - XRT as rescheduled today -> re: response, may see symptomatic
   improvement in [**7-18**] days, +/- radiographic improvement
   - will continue to d/w goals of care with patient, Heme-Onc, and
   Rad-Onc regarding goals of care, esp re: trach
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Creatinine slowly
   improving.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - goal 1-2L negative
   - renally dose meds
   - TID lytes during diuresis

   # Hypotension/CHF:  Pt has intermittently required levophed. Last TTE
   with RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. Has compression of
   pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. DDx includes intravascular
   depletion (as evident of bump in Cr, decreased UOP following diuresis),
   less likely to be septic, adrenal insufficieny. Cannot follow JVP given
   known high PA pressures [**2-10**] mass effect.  Right heart failure is likely
   causing poor left heart filling/preload and poor total cardiac output
   despite normal EF percentage.  Currently on neo to enable diuresis.
   - limit sedation as appropriate

   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU has been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has undergone three sessions of radiation therapy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from the NSCLC. Other potential causes for the respiratory failure include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right heart failure with severe pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypernatremia, which has been managed by increasing free water intake. The patient is also experiencing hypotension and right heart failure, possibly due to compression of the pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy or intravascular depletion. The patient's renal function has been affected, with an increase in creatinine levels, but is slowly improving. The patient has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and is being managed with diuretics and diltiazem. The patient's glucose levels have been monitored, and insulin sensitivity syndrome (ISS) is suspected. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU with planned radiation therapy today."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation trial.  Reduce
   sedation during daytime.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependent.  Now volume expanded.  Plan to monitor BP, maintian MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Recurrent, attributed to diuresis.  Continue to
   provide free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Local XRT to right
   hilum completed.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to
   successfully extubate.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Hope
   to promote gentle net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip and
   vasopressor as needed.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the right lung, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. The patient also has hypotension, hypernatremia, lung cancer (non-small cell), pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, and fluid overload. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, and they are currently receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, obstructing lesion in the right lung, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is partly attributed to right heart failure. There is a risk of inadequate tissue perfusion, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has recurrent hypernatremia, likely due to diuresis. If not managed properly, there is a risk of severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

4. Lung Cancer: The patient has non-small cell lung cancer with poor prognosis. There is a risk of disease progression, spread to other organs, and resistance to treatment.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the right lung, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is attributed to right heart failure. The plan is to monitor blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Vasopressors will be used as needed.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels attributed to diuresis. Free water will be provided, and serial sodium levels will be monitored.

4. Lung cancer: The patient has non-small cell lung cancer with poor prognosis. Local X-ray therapy to the right hilum has been completed, and oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if the patient can be successfully extubated.

5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension attributed to previous left pneumonectomy and tumor involvement of the right pulmonary artery.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has renal failure due to an IV contrast dye load. Plans include active net diuresis, renal dose medication, and monitoring of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

7. Fluid overload: The patient is now intravascularly volume-replete but has total body fluid overload."

   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  XRT
   started [**1-22**], 9 days ago we were told by rad-onc that if we would see
   improvement it would be at 7-10 days from initiation.  Patient has
   repeatedly refused trach.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  High peak pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance ->
   tumor +/- secretions, possible response to XRT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation, leading to intubation. His respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure with severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PA HTN).
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is being treated with fluconazole for yeast and penicillin for potential actinomycosis from a previous infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has shown signs of AKI, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from a recent dye load. Creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a bump in creatinine, decreased urine output following diuresis.
4. Hypotension/Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient requires intermittent use of levophed for hypotension. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed right ventricular dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. The likely etiology is intravascular depletion, although septic shock and adrenal insufficiency are"

   the pt ""desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it
   will enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to
   potentially treat pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and
   penicillin for potential actinomycosis from previous cx at [**Hospital1 966**].  XRT
   started [**1-22**], 9 days ago we were told by rad-onc that if we would see
   improvement it would be at 7-10 days from initiation.  Patient has
   repeatedly refused trach.

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  High peak pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance ->

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus due to NSCLC, for which a stent was placed in the bronchus intermedius. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN). The patient's current goals of care include completing radiation therapy (XRT) to potentially enable extubation, treating pulmonary infection with fluconazole for yeast and penicillin for potential actinomycosis from a previous cross at Hospital1. The patient has repeatedly refused tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including NSCLC, VAP, and right heart failure with severe PA HTN. High peak pressures with lower plateaus suggest resistance due to tumor +/- secretions, possible response to XRT.
2. Hypotension/CHF: The patient has intermittently required levophed, and the most recent TTE showed RV dysfunction and remarkable PA hypertension. There is compression of the pulmonary arteries from lymphadenopathy. Differential diagnoses include intravascular depletion (as evident from"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Multifactorial, likely due to
   obstructing R hilar mass and post-obstructive PNA.  On lasix gtt to
   optimize volume status, finished course of antibiotics for PNA, s/p IP
   stenting.  Currently w/scant oral secretions.
   - Trial on PSV
   - Diuresis
   - Follow secretions
 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, VOLUME OVERLOAD
 Finally making progress on
   diuresis but still volume up and markedly positive over the admission.
   Had some pauses w/suctioning, so digoxin stopped.
   - Lasix gtt, goal I/O -1-2L
   - Use neo for BP support if needed
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
 Briefly in afib w/RVR, currently in NSR
   - Follow rythm
 HYPOTENSION
 Likely secondary to R-heart failure
   - Diuresis to improve LV function (given ventricular interdependence)
   - Pressors to support diuresis.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 Post obstructive PNA, s/p a course of antibiotics,
   currently minimal secretions, stable CXR.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Cr peaked at ~3, likely CIN, now markedly
   improved.
   - Follow UOP, lytes, BUN, Cr
 LUNG CANCER
 S/p palliative XRT for R hilar mass
   - Heme/Onc following, appreciate input
 DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II
 Follow finger sticks

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who underwent a pneumonectomy and is now in the ICU for palliative radiation therapy (XRT). The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, pneumonia, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and lung cancer.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 97/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube with supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

Physical examination reveals subconjunctival hemorrhage on the right eye, normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, and no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination shows a loud second heart sound (S2) and an S3 heart sound. Peripheral vascular examination demonstrates 2+ deep pain (DP) bilaterally in the lower extremities. Respiratory examination indicates bronchial breath sounds and mon"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with airway obstruction, requiring palliative radiation therapy (XRT).
- The patient underwent a pneumonectomy (lung removal) and is now in the ICU for palliative care.
- The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, and pneumonia.
- The patient's renal function has improved after experiencing acute kidney injury.
- Other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, hypotension, diabetes mellitus type II, and lung cancer.
- The patient is receiving diuretics, antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications to manage their conditions.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 97/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to the obstructing NSCLC and post-obstructive pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory status.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has developed pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart strain and potential heart failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient had an episode of acute kidney injury, and there is a risk of recurrent renal dysfunction or failure.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's blood glucose levels should be monitored closely to manage their"

","The patient's chief complaint is related to pressure support and improved CMV. The patient has been diuresed well all day. 

Regarding the 24-hour events, there are no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was administered on [**2139-1-29**] at 07:00 AM. 

In terms of infusions, the patient is receiving Furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 15 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include Fentanyl, Famotidine (Pepcid), and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis). 

Under review of systems, the patient's flowsheet data as of [**2139-2-1**] at 06:32 AM shows vital signs with a temperature range of 37.2-37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 101-108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 69/45 to 156/131 mmHg, respiratory rate between 24-27 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and the patient's weight is 104.9 kg, with a height of 70 inches. 

Fluid balance indicates total input of 2,604 mL (802 mL PO, 1,181 mL TF, 488 mL IVF, and 130 mL NG) and total output of 4,045 mL (1,155 mL urine). 

Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, ventilator mode set to CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 127, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results of pH 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 64 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) 107 mEq/L, base excess (BE) -38 mEq/L, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100%, and minute ventilation (Ve) 8.8 L/min. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. The patient's eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat are normal. Cardiovascular examination shows a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border (LLSB), and peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable. Respiratory and chest examination indicates symmetric expansion and rhonchorous breath sounds with more prominence on the right side. Abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurologic examination shows appropriate responses to questions and follows commands. 

Laboratory results include leukocyte count (WBC) of 7.7 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 29.9-27.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 425 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) between 1.1-1.5 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) 39-41 mmHg, glucose levels ranging from 126-149 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

Assessment and plan indicate the patient's goals of care, including limited radiation therapy (XRT) to potentially enable extubation and treat pulmonary infection. The patient has refused tracheostomy. 

The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is due to multifactorial causes, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN). Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart failure. 

The patient will receive a scopolamine patch, continue pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials, and monitor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). Antibiotics will be discontinued, and the patient will be monitored for fever or leukocytosis. Lasix will"

   Disposition:  ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC. The patient underwent stenting of the bronchus intermedius but continues to experience multifactorial respiratory failure, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN) secondary to right heart failure.

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix) for diuresis, famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The patient is also receiving nutrition through a pulmonary tube and has been started on radiation therapy (XRT) for the NSCLC.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), but these have been improving with diuresis. The patient's potassium levels are low, so potassium chloride supplementation is being given during diuresis. The patient's sodium levels are stable at 146 mEq/L, and free water boluses are being given to maintain hydration.

The patient's cardiac status indicates right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and remarkable pulmonary artery hypertension. An echocardi"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate (HR) between 95-108 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 65/53 to 156/131 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute with spontaneous ventilation not assessed, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%.

The patient is mechanically ventilated through a endotracheal tube with the following settings: tidal volume (Vt) set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) at 127, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure at 22 cmH2O, and compliance at 28.6 cmH2O/mL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 64 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 107 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 38 mEq/L, base excess (BE) at -11 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) at 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, right-sided subconjunctival hemorrhage, normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, normal cardiovascular examination, bronchial breath sounds with monophonic wheezes on the right side, soft non-tender abdomen, edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, attentive orientation with normal movement, tone not assessed, and no neurological deficits.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.8 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) at 425 K/uL, sodium (Na+) at 135 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 1.1 mg/dL, chloride (Cl-) at 38 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 27.3%, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 6.2 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.5 mg/dL, glucose at 142 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute hypotension, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), renal failure, acute lung cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutritional support"

   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it will
   enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to potentially
   treat pulmonary infection.  XRT started [**1-22**], now reaching cut-off for
   seeing improvement.  Patient has repeatedly refused trach.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  ET secretions have been improving, althought pt has oral
   secretions. Will try scopolamine. Will continue to aggressively diurese
   while awaiting effects of XRT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including furosemide, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in blood pressure. The respiratory rate is elevated, and the oxygen saturation is maintained at 98%. The heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight has decreased from 98.4 kg at admission to 93 kg currently. There is a significant fluid balance, with total intake exceeding total output. The patient is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary tube and has an arterial line in place.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The creatinine levels are within normal range, but there are abnormal potassium, sodium, and chloride levels. The glucose levels are consistently high, indicating uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, lung cancer, hypotension, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to pneumonia, worsening renal function, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and complications related to the presence of a central line or arterial line.

   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it will
   enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to potentially
   treat pulmonary infection.  XRT started [**1-22**], now reaching cut-off for
   seeing improvement.  Patient has repeatedly refused trach.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  ET secretions have been improving, althought pt has oral
   secretions. Will try scopolamine. Will continue to aggressively diurese
   while awaiting effects of XRT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient has been intubated due to bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. He has a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus from NSCLC and underwent stenting of the bronchus intermedius. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN). The barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate (HR) of 100 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 95/56 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 102, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 30 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Plateau) of 22 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, COPD.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial.  Reduce sedation during daytime.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependen.  Good response to net diuresis.  Now volume expanded.  Plan
   to monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Recurrent, attributed to diuresis.  Continue to
   provide free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Aggressively replete to K>4.0
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS -- attributed to vigorous net diuresis.
   Aggresively replete Cl (as KCl).
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Local XRT to right
   hilum completed.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to
   successfully extubate.  Consider repeat chest imaging (CT).
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   Much improved.  Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all
   meds.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Plan
   to continue net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip (and
   vasopressor as needed).  Aim for goal ~2 L net negative.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They are currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of lung cancer (non-small cell), pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and COPD. They also have a background of NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus).

24-hour events include remaining on a lasix drip over the weekend, vasopressors now being off, and the patient being monitored closely in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/59 to 106/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

The patient's review of systems is largely unchanged from admission, with no significant findings in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, integumentary (skin), endocrine, heme/lymph, neurologic, or psychiatric/sleep systems. However, there is a notable conjunctival hemorrhage in the right eye and edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and normal liver function tests. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, but remain within acceptable ranges. The patient's electrolytes indicate hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Renal function tests show improvement from acute renal failure.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient continues to experience respiratory failure, primarily due to pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and COPD. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, maintain glucose levels below 150 mg/dL, monitor arterial blood gases (ABG), and work towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation trial.

Hypotension is attributed to right heart failure, and the preload-dependent response to net diuresis has been good. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.

Hypernatremia is recurrent and attributed to diuresis. Free water administration will continue, and serial sodium levels will be monitored.

Hypokalemia is attributed to diuresis, and aggressive repletion of potassium to a level above 4.0 mEq/L will be pursued.

Metabolic alkalosis is attributed to vigorous net diuresis. Aggressive repletion of chloride (as KCl) will be done.

Lung cancer, non-small cell type, with poor prognosis, has been treated with local external beam radiation therapy (XRT) to the right hilum. Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if the patient successfully extubates. Repeat chest imaging (CT) will be considered.

Pulmonary hypertension is severe and attributed to previous"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, COPD.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial.  Reduce sedation during daytime.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependen.  Good response to net diuresis.  Now volume expanded.  Plan
   to monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Recurrent, attributed to diuresis.  Continue to
   provide free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Aggressively replete to K>4.0
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS -- attributed to vigorous net diuresis.
   Aggresively replete Cl (as KCl).
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Local XRT to right
   hilum completed.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to
   successfully extubate.  Consider repeat chest imaging (CT).
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   Much improved.  Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all
   meds.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Plan
   to continue net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip (and
   vasopressor as needed).  Aim for goal ~2 L net negative.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure, with multifactorial obstacles including pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung (s/p stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and COPD. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 89/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has right conjunctival hemorrhage and edema, as well as edema in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated potassium levels, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels are also abnormal.

The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer, for which they have completed local XRT to the right hilum. The oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if the patient successfully extubates. Repeat chest imaging (CT) is recommended.

The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension attributed to a previous left pneumonectomy and now with tumor involvement of the right pulmonary artery. They also have acute renal failure likely attributable to iv contrast dye load, but it has improved. Active net diuresis is planned to mobilize fluids.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. This includes pneumonia in the right lower lobe, an obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung with a stent placement, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and being treated with empirical antimicrobials for the pneumonia.

The patient also presents with hypotension, which is partly attributed to right heart failure. The patient has responded well to net diuresis and is now volume expanded. The plan is to monitor the patient's blood pressure and maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 60 mmHg.

Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia, which is recurrent and attributed to diuresis. The plan is to provide free water and monitor serial sodium levels.

Hypokalemia has been observed in the patient, which is attributed to diuresis. Aggressive repletion of potassium to a level above 4.0 is being implemented.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, which is attributed to vigorous net diuresis. Aggressive repletion of chloride (as KCl) is planned.

The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer with poor prognosis. Local X-ray therapy to the right hilum has been completed, and oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if successful extubation occurs."

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it will
   enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to potentially
   treat pulmonary infection.  XRT started [**1-22**], now reaching cut-off for
   seeing improvement.  Patient has repeatedly refused trach.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  ET secretions have been improving, althought pt has oral
   secretions. Will try scopolamine. Will continue to aggressively diurese
   while awaiting effects of XRT.
   .
   - cont scopolamine patch
   - cont PSV trials, daily RSBI
   - d/c
d abx, monitor for fever or leukocytosis
   - d/c
d digoxin given pauses
   - cont lasix gtt, goal  (-) 2-4 liters daily, BUN/Cr cont to decrease,
   will monitor alkalosis and replete KCl with diuresis
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - will check ABG today
   .
   #Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis
  Continue to repleat chloride via KCL, as
   Bicarb of 40 is likely [**2-10**] diuretic induced chloride wasting, on top of
   chronic CO2 retention.
   .
   # AF with RVR: currently in sinus.  Cont telemetry
   - diltiazem prn for AF with RVR
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received all
   sessioins of XRT. [**Month (only) 11**] take several more days to see improvement.
   - plan for optimization of respiratory factors within the week and
   multi-team fam mtg re: goals of care after that point
   - Rad Onc says no need for repeat CT
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Creatinine now
   normal. Renal signed off.  Phenylephrine to assist with diuresis if
   hypotension recurs.
   - goal 2-4 L negative
   - renally dose meds
   - PM lytes during diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension/CHF:  TTE showed RV dysfunction and remarkable PA
   hypertension. Has compression of pulmonary arteries from
   lymphadenopathy. Has not required neo for past 24 hours, seems that
   diuresis has improved filling pressures and forward flow.
   ..
   #  Hypernatremia:  Currently 148 with frequent free water.

   Disposition:  ICU
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. He also has a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC and has undergone stenting of the bronchus intermedius.

The patient's current condition includes continued diuresis, advanced ET tube, PSV trial in the afternoon/evening, tolerating well at 12/5, and aggressive repletion of KCl for metabolic alkalosis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 97 bpm (with a range of 88-108 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 93/55 mmHg to 144/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (with a range of 0-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: right lower extremity edema (1+), left lower extremity edema (1+), and warm skin. The physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, conjunctival hemorrhage on the right eye, normocephalic head, endotracheal tube, and NG tube"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hypoxic respiratory failure. He was intubated due to desaturation during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus. The patient underwent stenting of the bronchus intermedius and has been receiving aggressive diuresis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's blood pressure is 93/55 mmHg, heart rate is 97 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and worsening oxygenation, should be conducted.
2. Right heart failure (RHF): The patient's hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAHT) suggest the possibility of RHF. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload, such as peripheral edema and increased respiratory effort, is important"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, COPD.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial.  Reduce sedation during daytime.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependen.  Good response to net diuresis.  Now volume expanded.  Plan
   to monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Recurrent, attributed to diuresis.  Continue to
   provide free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Aggressively replete to K>4.0
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS -- attributed to vigorous net diuresis.
   Aggresively replete Cl (as KCl).
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Local XRT to right
   hilum completed.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to
   successfully extubate.  Consider repeat chest imaging (CT).
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   Much improved.  Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all
   meds.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Plan
   to continue net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip (and
   vasopressor as needed).  Aim for goal ~2 L net negative.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, COPD.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial.  Reduce sedation during daytime.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependen.  Good response to net diuresis.  Now volume expanded.  Plan
   to monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Recurrent, attributed to diuresis.  Continue to
   provide free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Aggressively replete to K>4.0
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS -- attributed to vigorous net diuresis.
   Aggresively replete Cl (as KCl).
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Local XRT to right
   hilum completed.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to
   successfully extubate.  Consider repeat chest imaging (CT).
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- Likely attributable to iv contrast dye load.
   Much improved.  Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all
   meds.  Monitor BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Plan
   to continue net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip (and
   vasopressor as needed).  Aim for goal ~2 L net negative.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to desaturation during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus caused by NSCLC. The patient underwent stent placement to the bronchus intermedius and is now experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure with severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PA HTN). The patient's current goals of care include attempting extubation after radiation therapy (XRT) to address the underlying lung cancer and treating the pulmonary infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is acute respiratory failure, which may be complicated by further deterioration due to underlying NSCLC, VAP, and right heart failure.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible shock or inadequate circulation, which may be related to right heart failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria/anuria, indicating impaired kidney function.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The"

   .
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it will
   enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to potentially
   treat pulmonary infection.  XRT started [**1-22**], now reaching cut-off for
   seeing improvement.  Patient has repeatedly refused trach.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  ET secretions have been improving, althought pt has oral
   secretions. Will try scopolamine. Will continue to aggressively diurese
   while awaiting effects of XRT.
   - cont scopolamine patch
   - cont PSV trials, daily RSBI
   - d/c
d abx, monitor for fever or leukocytosis
   - d/c
d digoxin given pauses
   - cont lasix gtt with metolazone, goal  (-) 2-4 liters daily, BUN/Cr
   cont to decrease, will monitor alkalosis and replete KCl with diuresis
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - will check ABG daily
   .
   #Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis
  Continue to repleat chloride via KCL, as
   Bicarb of 40 is likely [**2-10**] diuretic induced chloride wasting, on top of
   chronic CO2 retention.
   .
   # AF with RVR: currently in sinus.  Cont telemetry
   - diltiazem prn for AF with RVR
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received all
   sessioins of XRT. [**Month (only) 11**] take several more days to see improvement.
   - plan for optimization of respiratory factors within the week and
   multi-team fam mtg re: goals of care after that point
   - Rad Onc says no need for repeat CT, will not change decision to
   extubate
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Creatinine now
   normal. Renal signed off.  Phenylephrine to assist with diuresis if
   hypotension recurs.
   - goal 2-4 L negative
   - renally dose meds
   - PM lytes during diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension/CHF:  TTE showed RV dysfunction and remarkable PA
   hypertension. Has compression of pulmonary arteries from
   lymphadenopathy. Has not required neo for past 24 hours, seems that
   diuresis has improved filling pressures and forward flow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's right-sided chest pain has improved, and they are on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated respiratory rate. Lab results indicate acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient's goals of care include limited radiation therapy to enable extubation and treat pulmonary infection. The patient has refused a tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and oliguria/anuria. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels due to free water loss, and aggressive hydration with frequent free water boluses should be continued.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, and close monitoring of glycemic control is necessary.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is at risk for AF with rapid ventricular response, and telemetry monitoring should be continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube, receiving CPAP/PSV mode with a set FiO2 of 40%. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. The patient has been experiencing right-sided chest pain, and their review of systems is unchanged from admission except for this new symptom. The patient has a history of NSCLC, and their medical and family history was obtained from Hospital 31. No known drug allergies were reported.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced tachypnea at 0/5 but did well until around 5 AM when they complained of right-sided chest pain. EKG and chest X-ray results are pending.
- The patient received infusions of furosemide and opioids for pain management.
- Other ICU medications were also administered.
- The patient's temperature was recorded at 38.1°C (100.5°F), and their blood pressure ranged from 98/63 mmHg to 76/54 mmHg.

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   # Goals of Care: Per meeting with ICU attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 323**] on [**1-21**],
   the pt desires to have a limited course of XRT on the hope that it will
   enable extubation.  Additionally, it will allow time to potentially
   treat pulmonary infection.  XRT started [**1-22**], now reaching cut-off for
   seeing improvement.  Patient has repeatedly refused trach.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and right heart CHF with severe
   PA HTN. Barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart
   failure.  ET secretions have been improving, althought pt has oral
   secretions. Will try scopolamine. Will continue to aggressively diurese
   while awaiting effects of XRT.
   .
   - cont scopolamine patch
   - cont PSV trials, daily RSBI
   - d/c
d abx, monitor for fever or leukocytosis
   - d/c
d digoxin given pauses
   - cont lasix gtt, goal  (-) 2-4 liters daily, BUN/Cr cont to decrease,
   will monitor alkalosis and replete KCl with diuresis
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - will check ABG today
   .
   #Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis
  Continue to repleat chloride via KCL, as
   Bicarb of 40 is likely [**2-10**] diuretic induced chloride wasting, on top of
   chronic CO2 retention.
   .
   # AF with RVR: currently in sinus.  Cont telemetry
   - diltiazem prn for AF with RVR
   .
   # NSCLC: Confirmed on Bx. Pathology c/w poorly differentiated
   carcinoma, Heme-Onc, Rad-Onc following.  Mapped and has received all
   sessioins of XRT. [**Month (only) 11**] take several more days to see improvement.
   - plan for optimization of respiratory factors within the week and
   multi-team fam mtg re: goals of care after that point
   - Rad Onc says no need for repeat CT
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Most likely etiology is CIN from dye load.  Creatinine now
   normal. Renal signed off.  Phenylephrine to assist with diuresis if
   hypotension recurs.
   - goal 2-4 L negative
   - renally dose meds
   - PM lytes during diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension/CHF:  TTE showed RV dysfunction and remarkable PA
   hypertension. Has compression of pulmonary arteries from
   lymphadenopathy. Has not required neo for past 24 hours, seems that
   diuresis has improved filling pressures and forward flow.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to desaturation during a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus caused by NSCLC. The patient has undergone stenting of the bronchus intermedius.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and right heart failure with severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PA HTN). The barriers to extubation are copious secretions and right heart failure. The patient's endotracheal (ET) secretions have been improving, although they still have oral secretions. The plan is to continue scopolamine patch, try spontaneous breathing trials (PSV) daily with respiratory system compliance and incentive spirometry (RSBI) monitoring.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, pneumonia, hypotension (not in shock), acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, hypernatremia (high sodium), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and diabetes mellitus type II (DM2).

The goals of care for the patient include a limited course of radiation therapy (XRT) to potentially enable extubation and treat pulmonary infection. The patient has refused a tracheostomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, COPD.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial.  Reduce sedation during daytime.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependen.  Good response to net diuresis.  Plan to monitor BP, maintain
   MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Recurrent, attributed to diuresis.  Continue to
   provide free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Aggressively replete to K>4.0
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS -- attributed to vigorous net diuresis.
   Aggresively replete Cl (as KCl).
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Local XRT to right
   hilum completed.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to
   successfully extubate.  Consider repeat chest imaging (CT).
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- iv contrast dye induced.  Much improved.
   Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Plan
   to continue net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip (and
   vasopressor as needed).  Aim for goal ~2 L net negative.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependen.  Good response to net diuresis.  Plan to monitor BP, maintain
   MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Recurrent, attributed to diuresis.  Continue to
   provide free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Aggressively replete to K>4.0
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS -- attributed to vigorous net diuresis.
   Aggresively replete Cl (as KCl).
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Local XRT to right
   hilum completed.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to
   successfully extubate.  Consider repeat chest imaging (CT).
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- iv contrast dye induced.  Much improved.
   Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine.

 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Plan
   to continue net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip (and

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to various factors such as pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the right lung, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and COPD. They are currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient also has hypotension attributed to right heart failure, hypernatremia due to diuresis, and hypokalemia also caused by diuresis. There is evidence of metabolic alkalosis as well. The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer with poor prognosis, severe pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure induced by contrast dye, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and underlying conditions like pneumonia and COPD, there is a high risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration pneumonia, or exacerbation of COPD.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and right heart failure indicate potential cardiovascular complications. These could include worsening heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and ongoing issues with fluid balance and diuretic use may lead to further renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Metabolic Complications: The patient's electrolyte im"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent intubation, bronchoscopy, and biopsy due to desaturation. He has a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus caused by NSCLC. The patient received a stent to the bronchus intermedius and is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/97 to 145/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 93 kg, with a decrease from admission weight of 98.4 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,535 mL and output of 4,510 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -975 mL. The patient's urine output is 1,750 mL. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.2-7.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 3.4 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, and blood glucose levels ranging from 127 to 148 mg/dL.

The patient's medical team has discussed goals of care with the patient, including the possibility of limited radiation therapy (XRT) to enable extubation. The patient has refused tracheostomy. The team plans to continue aggressive diuresis while awaiting effects of XRT. They also plan to try scopolamine for secretions, continue PSV trials with daily respiratory system compliance and resistance index (RSBI) assessments, and discontinue antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial reason for intubation was hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC. The patient's current status on CPAP/PSV may help improve oxygenation, but ongoing monitoring and support will be necessary.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Despite being on CPAP/PSV, the patient is still at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged intubation and potential aspiration of secretions.
3. Right heart failure (RHF): The patient's transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and remarkable pulmonary artery (PA) hypertension, which may indicate RHF. Diuretics and further optimization of respiratory factors should be continued to manage this condition.
4. Hypernatremia:"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent stenting of the right upper lobe bronchus intermedius due to partial occlusion caused by NSCLC. He was intubated during a bronchoscopy and biopsy procedure.

The patient's current condition includes diffuse ST-elevations on EKG, which are more concerning for pericarditis rather than a STEMI. The patient has received a heparin bolus and drip, high-dose Atorvastatin, full-dose aspirin, and beta-blockers. A transfer to the cath lab has been planned.

The patient desires limited radiation therapy (XRT) in hopes of enabling extubation. However, the patient has repeatedly refused a tracheostomy. The goals of care were discussed with the ICU attending.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN) secondary to right heart failure. Barriers to extubation include copious secretions and right heart failure. The patient has been given a scopolamine patch to reduce secretions, and aggressive diuresis is being continued while awaiting the effects of XRT.

The patient also has a non-gap metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to diuretic-induced chloride"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial.  Primary obstacles include
   pneumonia (RLL), obstructing lesion in remaining right lung (s/p
   stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, COPD.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG.  Hope to be able to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial.  Reduce sedation during daytime.
   ABNORMAL ECG -- ST segment elevation, although diffuse changes
   evident.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent pericarditis, but concern for active CAD.  As
   per Cardiology Consultation, plan to transport to cardiac cath lab for
   further evaluation.  IV heparin, ASA.
   HYPOTENSION -- in part attributed to right heart failure. Preload
   dependent.  Good response to net diuresis.  Plan to monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Recurrent, attributed to diuresis.  Continue to
   provide free water.  Monitror serial Na+.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Aggressively replete to K>4.0
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS -- attributed to vigorous net diuresis.
   Aggresively replete Cl (as KCl).
   LUNG CANCER
 Non-small cell.  Poor prognosis.  Local XRT to right
   hilum completed.  Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if able to
   successfully extubate.  Consider repeat chest imaging (CT).
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- severe, attributed to s/p left pneumonectomy
   and now with tumor involvement of right pulmonary artery.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- iv contrast dye induced.  Much improved.
   Continue plans for active net diuresis.  Renal dose all meds.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS
 now intravascularly volume replete, total body overload.  Plan
   to continue net diuresis to mobilize fluids --> lasix drip (and
   vasopressor as needed).  Aim for goal ~2 L net negative.
   NIDDM
 maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia, an obstructing lesion in the remaining right lung (s/p stent), pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and COPD. The patient's ECG shows diffuse ST segment elevation, which raises concern for active CAD, and the cardiology consultation plans to transport the patient to the cardiac cath lab for further evaluation. 

The patient also has hypotension, attributed in part to right heart failure, and is responding well to net diuresis. The patient's sodium levels are high due to recurrent diuresis, and free water will be provided to monitor and correct this. The patient's potassium levels are low, likely due to diuresis, and aggressive repletion of potassium is necessary. The patient has metabolic alkalosis, also attributed to vigorous net diuresis, and aggressive repletion of chloride (as KCl) is planned.

The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer with poor prognosis, and local XRT to the right hilum has been completed. Oncology plans to consider chemotherapy if the patient can successfully extubate. Repeat chest imaging (CT) is also being considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with NSCLC, with respiratory failure, with diffuse ST segment
   elevations on ECG and clean coronaries, likely secondary to
   pericarditis.
   .
   # Pericarditis:  Given territorial (inferolateral) distribution of
   STEs, there was appropriate concern for STEMI in this patient.  Patient
   was started on Heparin bolus and drip, started on high dose
   Atorvastatin, ASA 325mg, Plavix 600mg, and BBs.  On further review of
   EKG, patient had diffuse PR depressions and PR elevation in AVR.  Cath
   showed clean coronaries.  Pericarditis related to either XRT versus
   Pericardial mets is most likely. Echo with no effusion.  Another
   possibility is paradoxical embolus to coronary arteries, but on cath,
   no
haziness
 was seen in the coronary arteries that would be
   consistent with paradoxical emboli.  Patient has been chest pain-free
   since arriving at CCU.
   - f/u EKG from this morning
   - No treatment at this time as patient has no chest discomfort
   - morphine prn pain
   - can initiate indomethacin or colchicine for pericarditis if pt
   symptomatic
   - hold off on bubble study since the likelihood of paradoxical emboli
   is low
   .
   #. Pump:  Euvolemic on exam.  Preserved systolic function, RV free wall
   HK.  Patient had been actively diursed in [**Hospital Unit Name 10**], however minimal
   evidence of volume overload.  Patient 13L pos for LOS.  Given dye load
   and renal failure, hold on further diuresis. Furthermore, labs are
   consistent with contraction alkalosis.
   - continue to monitor volume status
   - hold off on diuresis for now
   .
   # Rhythm:  h/o AFib w/ RVR in MICU.  Currently in NSR.
   - Monitor on tele
   - no anticoagulation necessary
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. Known partial occlusion of RUL
   bronchus from NSCLC. Now s/p stent to bronchus intermedius. Failure
   likely [**2-10**] NSCLC and VAP.  Currently stable on CPAP with PEEP of 5.
   Barriers to extubation are copious secretions.  Currently patient does
   not appear volume overloaded, and heart issue unlikely playing a major
   role in the respiratory failure.
   - no diuresis for now
   - cont PSV trials, daily RSBI
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - will check ABG daily
   .
   # DM2:
   - ISS
   .
   # Goals of Care:   Patient is s/p XRT, which did not have intended
   effect of patient being better substrate for extubation.  Plan is for
   home hospice, with possible extubation once transferred home. Patient
   has repeatedly refused trach.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with respiratory failure. 
- There were concerns about a possible STEMI due to diffuse ST segment elevations on the ECG, but the coronary arteries were found to be clean during the catheterization.
- The EKG also showed diffuse PR depressions and PR elevation in AVR, indicating pericarditis. The patient was started on heparin, high-dose atorvastatin, ASA 325mg, Plavix 600mg, and beta-blockers.
- An echo revealed no effusion, suggesting that the pericarditis is likely related to either radiation therapy (XRT) or pericardial metastases. Paradoxical embolus to coronary arteries was ruled out as there was no haziness seen in the coronary arteries during the catheterization.
- The patient has been pain-free since arriving in the CCU.

Medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to NSCLC causing partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus, for which a stent was placed in the bronchus intermedius. The failure may also be exacerbated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who presented with respiratory failure. He had diffuse ST segment elevations on ECG, but his coronaries were clean, indicating that the cause of his symptoms was likely pericarditis. The patient was started on heparin, high-dose atorvastatin, aspirin, Plavix, and beta-blockers. An echocardiogram showed no effusion, ruling out pericardial effusion as a cause. Another possibility considered was a paradoxical embolus to the coronary arteries, but this was not supported by the catheterization findings. The patient has been chest pain-free since arriving at the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericarditis: The patient's symptoms and EKG findings suggest pericarditis. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening pain or inflammation, which may require treatment with anti-inflammatory medications such as indomethacin or colchicine.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. He has a partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC and has undergone stenting of the bronchus intermedius. His respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. Close monitoring"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient had diffuse ST segment elevations on ECG but clean coronaries, suggesting pericarditis rather than a heart attack. The patient was started on heparin, high-dose atorvastatin, aspirin, Plavix, and beta-blockers. The EKG showed diffuse PR depressions and PR elevation in AVR, and a catheterization confirmed clean coronaries. The patient's symptoms improved, and he was transferred to the CCU where he remains pain-free.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR) in the MICU, but is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to NSCLC and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently stable on CPAP with PEEP of 5 and does not appear volume overloaded. Barriers to extubation include copious secretions.

The patient's goals of care include home hospice with possible extubation once transferred home, as the patient has repeatedly refused tracheostomy. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) will be managed by the ISS.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to his underlying lung cancer and VAP"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and respiratory failure, who is currently intubated. He has diffuse ST segment elevations on ECG, which are likely secondary to pericarditis. The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is multifactorial, including NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN). 

The patient is currently stable on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. Barriers to extubation include copious secretions, which are improving, and potential improvement in tumor burden after radiation therapy (XRT). 

The plan is to continue trials of pressure support ventilation (PSV) daily, with the ultimate goal of weaning and extubation to allow the patient to return home for palliative care. 

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis/respiratory acidosis, non-small cell lung cancer, and pericarditis. 

For the metabolic alkalosis/respiratory acidosis, it is recommended to trend gases daily. 

Regarding the non-small cell lung cancer, imaging and biopsy have been performed, and the patient has received XRT without significant effect. It is expected to see an effect 7-12 days post-treatment, and re-scanning next week will be considered to evaluate the effect of XRT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently in the ICU. The patient has been intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to NSCLC, severe pulmonary hypertension, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC and has undergone stenting of the bronchus intermedius.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate ranging from 93 to 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 70 to 138 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 0 to 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode, with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 19 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, but within normal ranges. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 121 and 148 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with NSCLC, with respiratory failure, with diffuse ST segment
   elevations on ECG and clean coronaries, likely secondary to
   pericarditis.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in setting of
   bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation. He has a known partial
   occlusion of RUL bronchus from NSCLC and is s/p stent to bronchus
   intermedius. Failure likely multifactorial, [**2-10**] NSCLC, VAP, and with
   severe PA HTN. Currently stable on CPAP with PEEP of 5. Barriers to
   extubation are copious secretions which are improving and may have had
   some improvement in tumor burden after XRT
   - cont PSV trials, daily [**Last Name (LF) 1093**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] attempt to wean vent as tolerated
   - will touch base with IP over weekend/Monday regarding possible need
   for PEG/trach
   - nebulizer standing and PRN
   - will check ABG daily , daily [**First Name3 (LF) 1093**]
   # Non-Small Cell Lung CA:  Imaging and bx as above.  S/p XRT treatment
   without significant effect, expect to see effect 7-12 days post-tx per
   rad-onc.
   - consider re-scanning next week to evaluate effect of XRT
   - onc following, appreciate recs
   # Pericarditis: Clean cath in setting of STE c/w pericarditis.  Patient
   is currently pain free on no pain medications though written prn.
   Unclear what cause it, could be viral though no pain versus XRT related
   vs mets.
   - continue prn pain medication including NSAIDs though asx
   - continue tele
   #. Hypervolemia:  Had been diuresed aggressively, now appears euvolemic
   on exam. Preserved systolic function, RV free wall HK on echo.  Patient
   had been actively diursed in [**Hospital Unit Name 10**], however minimal evidence of volume
   overload currently. Patient 13L pos for LOS. Given dye load and renal
   failure, hold on further diuresis.
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia:  likely [**2-10**] chronic disease, at baseline
   - trend
   - T&S active
   # AFib:  w/ RVR in MICU. Currently in NSR.
   - continue tele
   # Goals of Care: Patient is s/p XRT, which did not have intended effect
   of patient being better substrate for extubation however, patient has
   been tolerating CPAP well with PS of 14 and PEEP of 5.  Will continue
   to try to wean as above with goal to extubate to allow patient to
   return home.
   - Pall care came today to see but patient was very focused on continued

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, biopsy, and stent placement in the bronchus intermedius due to partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus caused by NSCLC. He was intubated during the procedure due to desaturation.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 98 bpm (with a range of 93-99 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 114/72 mmHg (with a range of 88-147/55-132 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute (with a range of 0-31 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen via endotracheal tube

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered crackles in the anterior chest, no jugular venous distension, and no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (347 K/uL), low hemoglobin (9.0 g/dL), elevated creatinine (1.65 mg/dL), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (40 mg/dL). The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and lung cancer. He has a history of left pneumonectomy and was recently diagnosed with hilar non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requiring stent placement. The patient received a course of XRT to enable extubation. He has a history of pneumonia, pericarditis, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) decision.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PSV/SBT mode, with a Vt of 400 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 32 breaths per minute, PEEP of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a RSBI of 67. His ABG shows a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, PaO2 of 350 mmHg, and HCO3- of 40 mEq/L. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/72 to 147/132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 90.7 kg, and his height is 70 inches."

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. He underwent bronchoscopy, biopsy, and desaturation, which resulted in his intubation. The patient has a known partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus due to NSCLC and has undergone stent placement in the bronchus intermedius. His failure to ventilate is likely multifactorial, including NSCLC, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN). 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/65 mmHg to 127/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered crackles anteriorly on the right lung and no breath sounds on the left lung. 

His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. 

The patient's medical history includes NSCLC, pericarditis, anemia (likely chronic disease), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The patient's goals of care are to be extub"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent intubation after experiencing desaturation during a bronchoscopy and biopsy procedure. He has a known partial occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus from NSCLC and has undergone stent placement in the bronchus intermedius. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, possibly involving NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA HTN). 

The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/65-127/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals scattered crackles in the anterior right lung and no breath sounds on the left side. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 38 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 134 mg/dL, and hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 165 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/65 to 127/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 98.4 kg to 87.4 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,718 mL, output of 2,105 mL, and a negative balance of -387 mL. The patient is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula and is on pressure support ventilation with a peak pressure of 5 cmH2O and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided in the note. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and his neurologic examination is also not performed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who presented with respiratory failure and diffuse ST segment elevations on ECG. The likely cause of these findings is pericarditis, as the patient's coronary arteries are clean. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, biopsy, and stent placement in the right upper lobe bronchus due to partial occlusion from NSCLC. He was intubated due to desaturation during the procedure. His respiratory failure is multifactorial, possibly due to NSCLC, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and severe pulmonary hypertension (PA HTN). The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 104/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. His neurologic examination is also unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if his lung function deteriorates further or if he develops additional complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
2. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): The patient's underlying lung cancer may progress and cause further respiratory compromise or spread to other organs.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient"

   He is aware of his prognosis and plan is for him to go to hospice
   today, if possible. He desaturates with any movement and he knows he
   may die in the next severe=[**Doctor Last Name **] days. He wishes to be comfortable but
   does not want any more aggressive care - and there is no therapy to
   offer.  Comfort is our only goal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of malignancy, pneumonia, hypertension, renal failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/63 mmHg to 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on multiple medications including regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include chest pain, respiratory failure, cancer, pneumonia, hypotension, renal failure, oliguria/anuria, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient's prognosis is poor, and the plan is to transfer him to hospice for comfort measures only. The patient is aware of his prognosis and wishes to avoid aggressive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current conditions, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (due to pneumonia and immunocompromised state), further deterioration of renal function, electrolyte imbalances (particularly hypernatremia), cardiac arrhythmias (given the presence of atrial fibrillation), and potential complications related to diabetes mellitus type II such as diabetic ketoacid"
