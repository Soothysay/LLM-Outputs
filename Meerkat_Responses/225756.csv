   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with a significant history of obstructive lung disease and
   now has evolved respiratory failure in the setting of what is likely
   aspiration event and mucus plugging. She has had ICU course complicated
   by significant hypotension and PTX at the time of CVL placement.  She
   does have significant changes in her ECG in the setting of normal
   enzymes but does represent change from previous.
    1)Respiratory Failure-Likely aspiration and mucus plugging in the
   setting of severe background lung disease.  This is supported by
   minimal resistance on the ventilator and capacity to tolerate RR=20
   with minimal autopeep.
   -AC support, weaned fi02 last night in the setting of elevated PaO2
   -NPO and OGT to suction to prevent furthur aspiration
   -Goal PCO2=55-60
   -consider PE as etiology for initial hypoxia interesting given deep
   t-wave inversion but clinical scenario is with significant alternative
   explanations, low CVP and primary bronchospasm noted with event.
   -Will start coverage with Vanco/Zosyn
   -Sputum culture to be sent
   -Will check CK/Troponin but so far negative
   2)Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Acute Exacerbation-
   -Continue with bronchodilators
 xopenex and ipratropium, suspect that
   patient should not get albuterol and xopenex at the same time
   -No systemic steroids at this time as bronchospasm does seem to be
   improved.
    3)Shock-Septic or Hypovolemic
   -CVP is reasonably low
   -She may have a component of neuropathic contribution but is not
   hypotensive at baseline
   -No evidence of acute MI to suggest cardiogenic shock and CVP is low
   -PE raised as possibility but it does appear to be a vasodilatory shock
   state and less likely obstructive, will get echo this morning to rule
   out right heart strain
   -This may be SIRS in the setting of aspiration pneumonitis
   -move CVP to goal of 12
   -Continue with Levophed and hope to wean with continued volume
   repletion
   -Will work to wean sedation as possible as may be a contributor to
   hypotension
   -ECHO to f/u if quick response is not seen
   4)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Paitent with A-fib suggested on ECG and telemetry
   -Will consider cardioversion if persistent hypotension seen and not
   able to be tolerated with pressor support
   -ECG changes may well be demand ischemia and will follow enzymes which
   are negative to date.
   -Will continue Digoxin as patient transiently in sinus rhythm
    5)Pneumonthorax-
   -Chest tube in place, maintain suction
   -Currently with small leak noted
   -Minimal drainage
   - continued chest tube while on postive pressure ventilation and until
   air appears to have drained from chest tube completely
   EKG changes:  Diffuse T wave inversions in inferior and anterior
   distribution.  Most likely related to demand ischemia in RCA and LAD
   territory.  Pulmonary embolism considered but would be less likely to
   cause strain in both arterial territories.  Diffuse changes also less
   consistent with myocardial infarction.
   - repeat EKG after improvement in hemodynamics
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - echocardiogram today
   .
   Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Currently with dark black material
   in NGT which is hemoccult negative.  Per hospitalist on floor, this
   likely is related to bannana flakes in patient's tube feeds.  On floor
   patient continued to have severe nausea and vomiting in relation to any
   PO intake.  Gastric emptying study showed 0% emptying at 4 hours.  Also
   stool occult positive.
   - serial hematocrits given concern initially for GI bleeding
   - active type and cross
   - currently intubated, sedated
   - nutrition consult
   - currently with significant black material being suctioned from
   stomach so unlikely will be able to administer PO medications or tube
   feeds until this has improved
   - currently holding j-tube feeds
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   .
   Chronic Abdominal Pain:  Likely related to gastritis.  Also concern
   that G-J tube may have possible leak.  Being followed by GI consult
   service.  She has had many upper endoscopies and suboptimal
   colonoscopies.  Plans is currently for optomizing her nutritional
   status and ultimately rehab.
   - currently on fentanyl for sedation, will have to reassess pain
   regimen when sedation decreased
   - follow gastroenterology recommendations
   .
   Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild iron
   deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.  Currently
   26 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
   .
   COPD: Severe emphysema on imaging.  Likely contributing to her
   respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers of xopenex and ipratropium
   - titrate oxygen for sats > 90%
   .
   Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned
   .

   now has evolved respiratory failure in the setting of what is likely
   aspiration event and mucus plugging. She has had ICU course complicated
   by significant hypotension and PTX at the time of CVL placement.  She
   does have significant changes in her ECG in the setting of normal
   enzymes but does represent change from previous.
    1)Respiratory Failure-Likely aspiration and mucus plugging in the
   setting of severe background lung disease.  This is supported by
   minimal resistance on the ventilator and capacity to tolerate RR=20
   with minimal autopeep.
   -AC support, weaned fi02 last night in the setting of elevated PaO2
   -NPO and OGT to suction to prevent furthur aspiration
   -Goal PCO2=55-60
   -will get CTA chest this morning to evaluate for possible PE/aspiration
   event
   -cont  Vanco/Zosyn
   -Sputum culture ordered, not yet sent
   - troponin 0.05, CKs are flat, do not suspect myocardial infarction as
   etiology of event
   2)Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Acute Exacerbation-
   -Continue with bronchodilators
 xopenex and ipratropium, suspect that
   patient should not get albuterol and xopenex at the same time
   -No systemic steroids at this time as bronchospasm does seem to be
   improved.
    3)Shock-Septic or Hypovolemic
   -CVP is reasonably low, now improved
   - place a-line this morning
   - check cortisol, consider stress dose steroids
   -She may have a component of neuropathic contribution but is not
   hypotensive at baseline
   -No evidence of acute MI to suggest cardiogenic shock and CVP was low
   initially
   -PE raised as possibility but it does appear to be a vasodilatory shock
   state and less likely obstructive, will get echo this morning to rule
   out right heart strain in addition to CTA
   -This may be SIRS in the setting of aspiration pneumonitis
   -move CVP to goal of 12
   -Continue with Levophed and hope to wean with continued volume
   repletion
   -Will work to wean sedation as possible as may be a contributor to
   hypotension,
   4)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Paitent with A-fib suggested on ECG and telemetry
    -ECG changes may well be demand ischemia and will follow enzymes which
   are negative to date.
   -Will continue Digoxin as patient transiently in sinus rhythm
    5)Pneumonthorax-
   -Chest tube in place, maintain suction
   -Currently with small leak noted
   -Minimal drainage
   - continued chest tube while on postive pressure ventilation and until
   air appears to have drained from chest tube completely
   EKG changes:  Diffuse T wave inversions in inferior and anterior
   distribution.  Most likely related to demand ischemia in RCA and LAD
   territory.  Pulmonary embolism considered but would be less likely to
   cause strain in both arterial territories.  Diffuse changes also less
   consistent with myocardial infarction.
   - repeat EKG after improvement in hemodynamics
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - echocardiogram today
   .
   Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Currently with dark black material
   in NGT which is hemoccult negative.  Per hospitalist on floor, this
   likely is related to bannana flakes in patient's tube feeds.  On floor
   patient continued to have severe nausea and vomiting in relation to any
   PO intake.  Gastric emptying study showed 0% emptying at 4 hours.  Also
   stool occult positive.
   - serial hematocrits given concern initially for GI bleeding
   - consider gi consult to assess
   - IV reglan
   - active type and cross
   - currently intubated, sedated, NPO
   - nutrition consult
   - currently with significant black material being suctioned from
   stomach so unlikely will be able to administer PO medications or tube
   feeds until this has improved
   - currently holding j-tube feeds
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   .
   Chronic Abdominal Pain:  Likely related to gastritis.  Also concern
   that G-J tube may have possible leak.  Being followed by GI consult
   service.  She has had many upper endoscopies and suboptimal
   colonoscopies.  Plans is currently for optomizing her nutritional
   status and ultimately rehab.
   - currently on fentanyl for sedation, will have to reassess pain
   regimen when sedation decreased
   - reconsult gi?
   - consider other agents such as low dose haldol to improve pain/psych
   issues and wean off a bit of sedation
   - also will calculate total narcotics previously used to assess how
   well we are treating her pain
   .
   Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild iron
   deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.  Currently
   26 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration.
   - serial hematocrits
   - guaic positive which is chronic, crit is stable
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
   .
   COPD: Severe emphysema on imaging.  Likely contributing to her
   respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers of xopenex and ipratropium
   - titrate oxygen for sats > 90%
   .
   Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned
   .
   FEN: NPO, IVF for above parameters, nutrition consult, replete
   electrolytes
   .
   Prophylaxis: SC  heparin, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including esophagectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial arrhythmia. She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, recurrent coffee ground emesis, and melena. The patient underwent intubation and subclavian line placement, but developed a pneumothorax. She required pressors to maintain blood pressure and showed signs of hypotension and shock.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. She has respiratory failure likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, exacerbated by severe underlying lung disease. There is also evidence of COPD exacerbation, which requires bronchodilators. The patient may be experiencing septic or hypovolemic shock, and there is suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding. She has atrial fibrillation, and there are EKG changes suggestive of ischemia in the coronary arteries. Additionally, the patient has gastroparesis, chronic abdominal pain, chronic blood loss anemia, and compression fractures in the thoracic spine.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and heparin. She is NPO (nothing by mouth) with an NG tube in place. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains intubated and sedated. The"

   -AC support, weaned fi02 last night in the setting of elevated PaO2
   -NPO and OGT to suction to prevent furthur aspiration
   -Goal PCO2=55-60
   -consider PE as etiology for initial hypoxia interesting given deep
   t-wave inversion but clinical scenario is with significant alternative
   explanations, low CVP and primary bronchospasm noted with event.
   -Will start coverage with Vanco/Zosyn
   -Sputum culture to be sent
   -Will check CK/Troponin but so far negative
   2)Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Acute Exacerbation-
   -Continue with bronchodilators
 xopenex and ipratropium, suspect that
   patient should not get albuterol and xopenex at the same time
   -No systemic steroids at this time as bronchospasm does seem to be
   improved.

   -Continue with Levophed and hope to wean with continued volume
   repletion
   -Will work to wean sedation as possible as may be a contributor to
   hypotension
   -ECHO to f/u if quick response is not seen
   4)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Paitent with A-fib suggested on ECG and telemetry
   -Will consider cardioversion if persistent hypotension seen and not
   able to be tolerated with pressor support
   -ECG changes may well be demand ischemia and will follow enzymes which
   are negative to date.
   -Will continue Digoxin as patient transiently in sinus rhythm
    5)Pneumonthorax-
   -Chest tube in place, maintain suction
   -Currently with small leak noted
   -Minimal drainage
   - continued chest tube while on postive pressure ventilation and until

   Chronic Abdominal Pain:  Likely related to gastritis.  Also concern
   that G-J tube may have possible leak.  Being followed by GI consult
   service.  She has had many upper endoscopies and suboptimal
   colonoscopies.  Plans is currently for optomizing her nutritional
   status and ultimately rehab.
   - currently on fentanyl for sedation, will have to reassess pain
   regimen when sedation decreased
   - follow gastroenterology recommendations
   .
   Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild iron
   deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.  Currently
   26 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including esophagectomy, COPD, and atrial arrhythmia. She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, recurrent coffee ground emesis, and melena. The patient underwent intubation and subclavian line placement but developed a pneumothorax. She is currently on pressors and has a chest tube in place for the pneumothorax. Her vital signs are stable, but she has significant changes in her ECG, indicating demand ischemia in the RCA and LAD territories. She also has gastroparesis, nausea, and malnutrition, with ongoing dark material being suctioned from her NG tube. There are concerns about chronic abdominal pain, chronic blood loss anemia, COPD exacerbation, and chronic back pain with compression fractures. The patient is receiving multiple medications and has multiple lines and tubes in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging in the setting of severe background lung disease (COPD). She is receiving mechanical ventilation support, and measures are being taken to prevent further aspiration.
2. Shock: The patient may have septic or hypovolemic shock, as indicated by low CVP and hypotension. It is important to continue with Levophed and work towards weaning off pressors while ensuring adequate volume repletion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of COPD and esophagectomy, admitted 40 days ago for malnutrition. She experienced acute respiratory distress and was intubated emergently. The patient had a pneumothorax, which required a chest tube placement, and was started on pressors. Overnight, there were EKG changes with anterolateral T wave inversions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/48 to 154/141 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin. The physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, absent pulses in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia. The assessment includes respiratory failure, potential COPD exacerbation, hot nephrology consultation, and ongoing cardiac evaluation. The plan involves continuing current ventilator settings, antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, and managing COPD symptoms. Additionally, the patient will need an arterial line due to unreliable blood pressures, and there is a suspicion of congestive heart failure. Sedation and agitation management are also part of the plan"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: 66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal
   perforation s/p esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Acute Respiratory Failure:  Hypoxic respiratory failure with
   echocardiogram without pericardial effusion or right ventricular
   strain. Patient is currently being treated for an aspiration PNA with
   Vanc/Zosyn. Patietn also has underlying emphysema, may have mucus plug.
   Pt also with a pneumothorax in the right side after subclavian line
   placement. A-a gradient 241. Patient with improving O2 requirements,
   but still hypoxic.
   -Continue vancomycin/Zosyn
   -F/u culture data
   -Measure death space
   -Repeat CXR in AM
   Shock: Patient with pneumonia and hypotension in the setting of
   sedation, mediactions and possibly transient bacteremia. CVP is better
   with boluses. Echocardiogram with EF >55% and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.
   -Continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12
   -Repeat EKG today
   Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  No air leak present now.
   - chest tube to water seal
   - serial CXR
   Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 100s.
   - continue digoxin
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension
   Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Currently with dark black material
   in NGT which is hemoccult negative.  Per hospitalist on floor, this
   likely is related to bannana flakes in patient's tube feeds.  On floor
   patient continued to have severe nausea and vomiting in relation to any
   PO intake.  Gastric emptying study showed 0% emptying at 4 hours.
   - serial hematocrits given concern initially for GI bleeding
   - active type and cross
   - currently intubated, sedated
   - nutrition consult in AM
   - currently with significant black material being suctioned from
   stomach so unlikely will be able to administer PO medications or tube
   feeds until this has improved
   - currently holding j-tube feeds
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild iron
   deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.  Currently
   26 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
   COPD: Severe emphysema on imaging.  Likely contributing to her
   respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers
   - titrate oxygen for sats > 90%
   Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: 66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal
   perforation s/p esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Acute Respiratory Failure:  Both hypercarbic and hypoxic.  Patient
   initially suctioned with retrieval of large mucous plug but
   subsequently started vomiting with inability to protect airway
   requiring emergent intubation.  Suspect respiratory failure is
   multifactorial relating to patient's underlying severe emphysema,
   mucous plugging and possible pneumonia.  Pulmonary embolism and cardiac
   ischemic also considered given respiratory failure and hypotension
   although would expect CVP to be elevated in these settings and clinical
   picture more consistent with other etiologies.
   - start vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia
   - xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   - deep suctioning if possible
   - will send sputum sample
   - blood and urine culures pending
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   Shock:  Patient became acutely hypotensive upon arrival to the MICU.
   Occurred in the setting of initiating sedating medications and
   intubation.  Also occurred in the setting of mucous plugging, rising
   white blood cell count and concern for aspiration.  CVP is low which
   would be consistent with either hypovolemic shock, decreased preload
   from medications and effects of positive pressure ventilation, and
   septic shock.  Cardiac and obstructive etiologies also considered given
   EKG changes but for now clinical picture appears more consistent
   infection vs. decreased preload.
   - IVF fluid boluses to maintain CVP 10-12, urine output 30cc/hr and SBP
   > 90
   - Levophed to maintain above paremeters
   - Repeat EKG
   - Rule out for myocardial infarction with serial cardiac enzymes
   - Vancomycin and Zosyn to cover for hospital acquired pneumonia
   - Repeat CXR in AM to assess size of pneumothorax
   - Attempt to limit use of midazolam since patient's blood pressures
   seem particularly sensitive to this [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - echocardiogram in AM
   Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  Air leak present.
   - chest tube to suction
   - serial CXR
   Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 100s.
   - continue digoxin
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension
   EKG changes:  Diffuse T wave inversions in inferior and anterior
   distribution.  Most likely related to demand ischemia in RCA and LAD
   territory.  Pulmonary embolism considered but would be less likely to
   cause strain in both arterial territories.  Diffuse changes also less
   consistent with myocardial infarction.
   - repeat EKG after improvement in hemodynamics
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - echocardiogram in AM
   Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Currently with dark black material

   likely is related to bannana flakes in patient's tube feeds.  On floor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophageal perforation post-esophagectomy, and severe gastroparesis. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including acute respiratory failure, shock, tension pneumothorax, multifocal atrial tachycardia, EKG changes consistent with ischemia, gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition, chronic abdominal pain, chronic blood loss anemia, severe emphysema, and compression fractures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe emphysema, mucous plugging, and possible pneumonia contribute to her respiratory failure. This condition requires close monitoring and management of her ventilator settings, oxygenation, and potential infection control measures.

2. Shock: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension during initiation of sedating medications and intubation. This could be due to hypovolemic shock, decreased preload from medications and positive pressure ventilation, or septic shock. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

3. Tension Pneumothorax: The patient had a tension pneumothorax that required decompression and chest tube placement. Continuous monitoring of chest tube output, serial chest X-rays, and adjustment of"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female admit with respiratory failure and likley aspiration event
   and mucus plugging in the setting of a history of esophagectomy and
   initial emergent placement of SCV catheter was complicated by
   pneumothorax.  She has had some improvement in hemodynamics but remains
   with pressor requirement.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Primary hypoxemia persists.  She has reasonable control of her
   ventialtion with adequate Ve maintained
   -Pneumothorax has resolved and air leak is not seen
   -Source is multi-factorial for persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure
   -[**Month (only) 8**] be contribution from left sided collapse
will maintain adequate
   PEEP
   -[**Month (only) 8**] be underlying pulmonary disease with significant emphysema and
   ineffective V/Q with significant apical dead space.
   -[**Month (only) 8**] be PE as has been raised but there is alternative explanations
   offered
given persistent hypoxemia will have to re-consider diagnosis
   if no clinical improvement seen.  Will check LENI at this time.
   2)COPD with acute exacerbation-
   -Continue with bronchodilators
   -Continue with ABX for pulmonary infection and sepsis
   3)Sepsis-Likely from pulmonary source
   -Continue antibiotics
   -Wean pressors
   -Keep CVP=12 as goal
   4)Pneumothorax-
   -Move to water seal today
   -Repeat CXR to evaluate PTX
   -Will continue to discuss with surgery as to timing of removal but
   would favor maintenance while PPV is in place
   5)Atrial Tachycardia-

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted with respiratory failure and is likely experiencing aspiration events and mucus plugging. She has a history of esophagectomy and initially had complications with the placement of a subclavian vein catheter due to pneumothorax. The patient's hemodynamics have shown some improvement, but she still requires pressor support.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1) Respiratory Failure:
   - The primary hypoxemia persists, but ventilation is controlled with adequate ventilation.
   - Pneumothorax has resolved, and there is no air leak observed.
   - The source of persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure may be multi-factorial, including potential left-sided collapse, underlying pulmonary disease with significant emphysema and ineffective V/Q with significant apical dead space, or PE.

2) COPD with acute exacerbation:
   - Continue with bronchodilators.
   - Continue with ABX for pulmonary infection and sepsis.

3) Sepsis-Likely from pulmonary source:
   - Continue antibiotics.
   - Wean pressors.
   - Keep CVP=12 as goal.

4) Pneumothorax:
   - Move to water seal today.
   - Repeat CXR to evaluate PTX.
   - Will continue to discuss with surgery as to timing of removal but would favor maintenance while PPV is in place.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: 66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal
   perforation s/p esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Acute Respiratory Failure:  Hypoxic respiratory failure with
   echocardiogram without pericardial effusion or right ventricular
   strain. Patient is currently being treated for an aspiration PNA with
   Vanc/Zosyn. Patietn also has underlying emphysema, may have mucus plug.
   Pt also with a pneumothorax in the right side after subclavian line
   placement. A-a gradient 241. Patient with improving O2 requirements,
   but still hypoxic.
   -Continue vancomycin/Zosyn for aspiration coverage
   -F/u culture data
   -treid to measure dead space ventilation but no CO2 equivalent in this
   campus, didnt' happen yesterday
   -Repeat CXR in AM
   - change nebs to standing
   Shock: Patient with pneumonia and hypotension in the setting of
   sedation, mediactions and possibly transient bacteremia. CVP is better
   with boluses. Echocardiogram with EF >55% and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.
   -Continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12
   - will speciate enterobacter in urine
    Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  No air leak present now.
   - chest tube to water seal yesterday, repeat chest x-ray without
   evidence of pneumothorax
   - serial CXR
   Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 100s.
   - continue digoxin
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension
    Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Currently with dark black material
   in NGT which is hemoccult negative.  Per hospitalist on floor, this
   likely is related to bannana flakes in patient's tube feeds.  On floor
   patient continued to have severe nausea and vomiting in relation to any
   PO intake.  Gastric emptying study showed 0% emptying at 4 hours.
   - serial hematocrits given concern initially for GI bleeding however
   guaic negative with stable crit
   - currently intubated, sedated- currently with significant black
   material being suctioned from stomach so unlikely will be able to
   administer PO medications or tube feeds until this has improved
   - currently on j-tube feeds
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
    Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild
   iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.
   Currently 26 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
    COPD: Severe emphysema on imaging.  Likely contributing to her
   respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats > 90%
    Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a complicated gastrointestinal history who underwent an esophagectomy and is now admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She has a history of COPD, severe gastroparesis, and emphysema. The patient was transferred from another hospital due to aspiration pneumonia and possible mucus plugging.

The patient's recent events include an ultrasound that showed no evidence of right heart strain or pulmonary embolism. She had a central line inserted but developed erythema and possible pus, so it was removed. The patient required fluid boluses for hypotension and has been receiving IV fluids. She also received antibiotics for aspiration coverage.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 90s, blood pressure around 90/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is sedated and intubated.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.5 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal liver function tests. The patient has a history of chronic blood loss anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 30-35, currently at 26.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory failure, shock, tension pneumothorax (resolved), gastroparesis, multifocal atrial tachycardia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: 66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal
   perforation s/p esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Acute Respiratory Failure:  Hypoxic respiratory failure with
   echocardiogram without pericardial effusion or right ventricular
   strain. Patient is currently being treated for an aspiration PNA with
   Vanc/Zosyn. Patietn also has underlying emphysema, may have mucus plug.
   Pt also with a pneumothorax in the right side after subclavian line
   placement. A-a gradient 241. Patient with improving O2 requirements,
   but still hypoxic.
   -Continue vancomycin/Zosyn
   -F/u culture data
   -treid to measure dead space ventilation but no CO2 equivalent in this
   campus, didnt' happen yesterday
   -Repeat CXR in AM
   Shock: Patient with pneumonia and hypotension in the setting of
   sedation, mediactions and possibly transient bacteremia. CVP is better
   with boluses. Echocardiogram with EF >55% and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.
   -Continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12
   -Repeat EKG today
    Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  No air leak present now.
   - chest tube to water seal
   - serial CXR
   Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 100s.
   - continue digoxin
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension
    Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Currently with dark black material
   in NGT which is hemoccult negative.  Per hospitalist on floor, this
   likely is related to bannana flakes in patient's tube feeds.  On floor
   patient continued to have severe nausea and vomiting in relation to any
   PO intake.  Gastric emptying study showed 0% emptying at 4 hours.
   - serial hematocrits given concern initially for GI bleeding
   - active type and cross
   - currently intubated, sedated
   - nutrition consult in AM
   - currently with significant black material being suctioned from
   stomach so unlikely will be able to administer PO medications or tube
   feeds until this has improved
   - currently holding j-tube feeds
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
    Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild
   iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.
   Currently 26 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
    COPD: Severe emphysema on imaging.  Likely contributing to her
   respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats > 90%
    Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned
    FEN: NPO, IVF for above parameters, nutrition consult, replete
   electrolytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a complicated gastrointestinal history, including esophagectomy, who is now in the ICU with acute respiratory failure. She has underlying emphysema, a pneumothorax on the right side, and a history of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax, and shock. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has had a chest tube placed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is characterized by low oxygen levels in the blood. This can be due to various factors, including the underlying emphysema, aspiration pneumonia, and the recent pneumothorax. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygen requirements and response to treatment is essential.

2. Tension Pneumothorax: The patient had a tension pneumothorax, which has been decompressed and treated with chest tube placement. The re-expansion of the lung on the chest X-ray is a positive sign, but monitoring for any recurrence or complications related to the chest tube is necessary.

3. Shock: The patient is showing signs of shock, likely secondary to the pneumonia and hypotension. Continuous fluid boluses are being administered to maintain a target central venous pressure (CVP) of 10-12. Close monitoring of the patient's blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted with respiratory failure and likely aspiration event. She had an esophagectomy and initial emergent placement of a subclavian central venous catheter, which was complicated by pneumothorax that resolved with CT placement. The patient is currently off pressors and febrile with a temperature of 101.4°F. She has a urine culture showing gentamicin-sensitive E. coli, and sputum culture 3+ GNR. The patient's allergies include codeine, for which she experiences hives. The last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin on 10/20/2142 at 06:00 AM and 08:30 AM respectively. The patient is intubated and unable to provide history. 

Key Points:
- The patient had a pneumothorax that was resolved with CT placement.
- Septic shock due to pulmonary and urinary tract infections is present.
- A new central line will be placed, and the right subclavian line will be removed.
- Plans for extubation are being made for next week.
- The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and not requiring high FiO2.
- The patient has severe malnutrition and inadequate nutrition through the J-tube.
- TPN will be considered after reviewing the tube feed history.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted with respiratory failure and likely aspiration event, along with mucus plugging. She has a history of esophagectomy and initial emergent placement of SCV catheter that was complicated by pneumothorax, which has since resolved. The patient is experiencing septic shock due to pulmonary and urinary tract infections, and gentamicin has been added to the treatment. The plan is to remove the right SCL and place a new central line today.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and not requiring high FiO2. A review of the CT from 10/15 showed dense left lower lobe consolidation, large stomach in the left thorax, no significant tracheobronchomalacia, and severe emphysema worsening V/Q mismatch with dense consolidation from aspiration pneumonia.

The patient also has severe malnutrition as indicated by a J-tube that is not providing goal nutrition. Consideration will be given to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) after reviewing the tube feed history.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and worsened by severe emphysema, dense consolidation from aspiration pneumonia, and mucus plugging.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Known COPD and emphysema exacerbated by
   aspiration pneumonia. Inititally question of mucus plugging as well.
   She currently has a small, stable R sided PTX [**3-3**] subclavian line
   placement. Patient continued to be vented, without changes in setting
   overnight secondary to not being able to protect airway, thick
   secretions, and hypoxia.  Sputum today with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast
   suggestive of aspiration PNA, and likely covered by gentamycin, zosyn
   and vancomycin.
   -Continue vancomycin/Zosyn  for aspiration coverage
   -F/u culture data
   -treid to measure dead space ventilation but no CO2 equivalent in this
   campus, didnt' happen yesterday
   -Repeat CXR in AM
   - change nebs to standing
   Shock: Patient in shock likely [**3-3**] urosepsis, PNA all involving GRN for
   which she is receiving zosyn, gentamycin . CVP is better with boluses.
   Echocardiogram with EF >55% and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   - continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12
   - speciate GNR in sputum and adjust coverage as needed
   - gent/vanco/zosyn
    Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  No air leak present now.
   - chest tube to water seal yesterday
   - serial CXR to follow
   Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 100s.
   - continue digoxin
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension
    Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  This is an ongoing issue given
   esophagectomy. Concern is that most of her TF are not being absorbed
   given gastroparesis. Nutrition is being consulted for potential switch
   to TPN. She has remained guaiac neg and stable hct. Continues to have
   some dark sputum on suctioning. Currently receiving PO meds via TF.
   - f/u nutrition recs today
   - consider switching to IV meds to ensure absorption
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
    Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild
   iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.
   Currently 26 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
    COPD: Severe emphysema on imaging.  Likely contributing to her
   respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats > 90%
    Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned
    FEN: TF, IVF for above parameters, replete electrolytes
    Prophylaxis: SC  heparin, [**Hospital1 **], PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with COPD, esophageal perforation, and severe gastroparesis.
- She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia and exacerbated by her underlying COPD and emphysema.
- She also has a small, stable right-sided pleural effusion (PTX) due to subclavian line placement.
- The patient is in shock, likely due to urosepsis and pneumonia, and is receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage for GNR bacteria.
- Tension pneumothorax was present but has been decompressed and treated with chest tube placement.
- The patient has multifocal atrial tachycardia and is being treated with digoxin.
- She has ongoing issues with gastroparesis, nausea, and malnutrition since her esophagectomy.
- The patient's chronic blood loss anemia is being managed with serial hematocrits and transfusions as needed.
- Her severe emphysema is contributing to her respiratory failure.
- The patient has chronic back pain and compression fractures, but no role for kyphoplasty.
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophageal perforation, and severe gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, a small stable right-sided pneumothorax, shock, and tension pneumothorax. She also has multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis, chronic blood loss anemia, severe emphysema, and chronic back pain with compression fractures. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Pneumothorax recurrence: Although the current right-sided pneumothorax has been stabilized, there is still a risk of recurrence due to the patient's underlying lung disease and potential for further barotrauma.
3. Shock: The patient's hypotension and low cardiac output indicate ongoing shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance will be essential to ensure adequate perfusion.
4. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the hundreds, indicating atrial tachycardia. This can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Known COPD and emphysema exacerbated by
   aspiration pneumonia. Inititally question of mucus plugging as well.
   She currently has a small, stable R sided PTX [**3-3**] subclavian line
   placement. Patient continued to be vented, without changes in setting
   overnight secondary to not being able to protect airway, secretions.
   Sputum today with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast suggestive of aspiration
   PNA, and likely covered by gentamycin, zosyn and vancomycin.
   -Continue vancomycin/Zosyn  for aspiration coverage
   -F/u culture data
   -treid to measure dead space ventilation but no CO2 equivalent in this
   campus, didnt' happen yesterday
   -Repeat CXR in AM
   - attempt to wean sedation and try PS
   Shock: Patient in shock likely [**3-3**] urosepsis, PNA all involving GRN for
   which she is receiving zosyn, gentamycin . CVP is better with boluses.
   Echocardiogram with EF >55% and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   - continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12
   - speciate GNR in sputum and adjust coverage as needed
   - gent/vanco/zosyn
    Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  Air leak noted today while pt on water
   seal. Put back on low suction, will follow with CXR and reconsider d/c
   CT tomorrow
   -? d/c CT tomorrow
   - chest tube to low suction
   - check CXR this PM
   -f/u thoracic recs
   Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 100s.
   - continue digoxin
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension
    Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  There is question whether or not
   patient is absorbing her TF. Residuals have been minimal which is
   promising however it is possible she has bowel edema that prevents her
   from absorbing nutrients, causing her malnutrition. Will try to give
   tylenol today and see if she is absorbing it, which will help us assess
   her GI fxn. For now will continue TF, replete electrolytes and f/u
   nutrition recs if they feel we should be switching to TPN sooner.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - tylenol test
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
    Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild
   iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.
   Currently 23 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration,
   however her hct has trended down since admission. Has been guaiac + but
   this has been her baseline and there is question whether this is caused
   by irritation at the J-tube site. Will transfuse as needed for now if
   needed; she is hemodynamically stable.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
    COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor of
   her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats > 90%
    Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned
    FEN: TF for now, IVF for above parameters, replete electrolytes
    Prophylaxis: SC  heparin, [**Hospital1 **], PPI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD and emphysema, who underwent esophagectomy and developed severe gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, shock (likely urosepsis), tension pneumothorax, multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition, chronic blood loss anemia, COPD exacerbation, and chronic back pain with compression fractures.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation. The patient is sedated and intubated.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, troponin T, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal a small, stable right-sided pleural effusion and good re-expansion on chest X-ray after decompression and chest tube placement.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration coverage, speciating GNR in sputum and adjusting coverage as needed, continuing fluid boluses"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Known COPD and emphysema exacerbated by
   aspiration pneumonia. Inititally question of mucus plugging as well.
   She currently has a small, stable R sided PTX [**3-3**] subclavian line
   placement.  Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast suggestive of
   aspiration PNA, and likely covered by zosyn and vancomycin.  Patient
   now on pressure support [**11-4**] with FiO2 of 50%. She is moving ~350cc and
   RR 15 with those settings. Patient almost at baseline mental status,
   diminished gag reflex, normal secretions, but got very agitated,
   tachycardic, hypertensive and desated when tried to be weaned. Now on
   Haldol standing plus zyprexa PRN.
   - Continue vancomycin/Zosyn  for aspiration coverage (day 2 and 5
   respectively)
   - F/u culture data
   - attempt to wean sedation and decrease FiO2; may be candidate for
   extubation later today.
   - Keep chest tube for today, since there is still PTX on CXR
   # Agitation: Patient became agitated when tried to be weaned of vent.
   -          Continue haldol PRN
   -          Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Shock: Patient in shock likely [**3-3**] urosepsis & PNA all involving GRN
   for which she is receiving zosyn. Echocardiogram with EF >55% and
   moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   - continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12
   - speciate GNR in sputum and adjust coverage as needed
   - vanco/zosyn (day 2 and 5 respectively)
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  Air leak noted today while pt on water
   seal yesterday. Put back on low suction, will follow final read of CXR
   and if no pneumo will try again to put on water seal.
   - chest tube to low suction
   - check CXR this PM
   - f/u thoracic recs
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 80s.
   - continue digoxin
   - can restart metoprolol today
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  There is question whether or not
   patient is absorbing her TF. Residuals have been minimal which is
   promising however it is possible she has bowel edema that prevents her
   from absorbing nutrients, causing her malnutrition. Patient absorbed
   tylenol, so there is some degree of absorption. Will continue TF for
   now.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild
   iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.
   Currently 23 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration,
   however her hct has trended down since admission. Has been guaiac + but
   this has been her baseline and there is question whether this is caused
   by irritation at the J-tube site. Will transfuse as needed for now if
   needed; she is hemodynamically stable.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned
   # FEN: TF for now, IVF for above parameters, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: SC  heparin, [**Hospital1 **], PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure.
- She underwent an esophagectomy and developed severe gastroparesis, which led to the aspiration of food into her lungs.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) and supplemental oxygen (FiO2 of 50%).
- She has a small, stable right-sided pleural effusion (PTX) and a subclavian line in place.
- Sputum culture results show the presence of GNR (Gram-negative rods) and budding yeast, indicating aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's mental status is almost back to baseline, but she becomes agitated, tachycardic, and hypertensive when attempting to be weaned from sedation.
- She is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration coverage, and her sedation is being managed with Haldol and Seroquel.
- The patient also has evidence of urosepsis and PNA involving GNR, for which she is receiving Zosyn.
- Her echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) greater than 55% and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient's chest tube has been placed to relieve tension pneumothorax, and she has good re-expansion on chest X-ray (CXR).
- She is experiencing multif"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Known COPD and emphysema exacerbated by
   aspiration pneumonia. Inititally question of mucus plugging as well.
   She currently has a small, stable R sided PTX [**3-3**] subclavian line
   placement.  Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast suggestive of
   aspiration PNA, and likely covered by zosyn and vancomycin.  Patient
   now on pressure support [**11-4**] with FiO2 of 50%. She is moving ~350cc and
   RR 15 with those settings. Patient almost at baseline mental status,
   diminished gag reflex, normal secretions, but got very agitated,
   tachycardic, hypertensive and desated when tried to be weaned. Now on
   Haldol standing plus zyprexa PRN.
   - Continue vancomycin/Zosyn  for aspiration coverage (day 2 and 5
   respectively)
   - F/u culture data
   - attempt to wean sedation and decrease FiO2; may be candidate for
   extubation later today.
   - Keep chest tube for today, since there is still PTX on CXR
   # Agitation: Patient became agitated when tried to be weaned of vent.
   -          Continue haldol PRN
   -          Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Shock: Patient in shock likely [**3-3**] urosepsis & PNA all involving GRN
   for which she is receiving zosyn. Echocardiogram with EF >55% and
   moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   - continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12
   - speciate GNR in sputum and adjust coverage as needed
   - vanco/zosyn (day 2 and 5 respectively)
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  Air leak noted today while pt on water
   seal yesterday. Put back on low suction, will follow final read of CXR
   and if no pneumo will try again to put on water seal.
   - chest tube to low suction
   - check CXR this PM
   - f/u thoracic recs
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 80s.
   - continue digoxin
   - can restart metoprolol today
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  There is question whether or not
   patient is absorbing her TF. Residuals have been minimal which is
   promising however it is possible she has bowel edema that prevents her
   from absorbing nutrients, causing her malnutrition. Patient absorbed
   tylenol, so there is some degree of absorption. Will continue TF for
   now.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild
   iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.
   Currently 23 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration,
   however her hct has trended down since admission. Has been guaiac + but
   this has been her baseline and there is question whether this is caused
   by irritation at the J-tube site. Will transfuse as needed for now if
   needed; she is hemodynamically stable.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned
   # FEN: TF for now, IVF for above parameters, replete electrolytes

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, emphysema, and recent esophagectomy who presented with acute respiratory failure. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, a small stable right-sided pleural effusion, and tension pneumothorax, which has been decompressed and a chest tube placed. She also has multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis, chronic blood loss anemia, and severe emphysema contributing to her respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's known COPD and emphysema, exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia, continue to cause hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Tension pneumothorax: The patient had a tension pneumothorax, which has been decompressed and a chest tube placed. However, there is still a small pleural effusion present, and there may be ongoing air leaks.
3. Shock: The patient is in shock likely due to urosepsis and pneumonia involving gram-negative rods (GNR) for which she is receiving zosyn. Echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction >55% and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Agitation: The patient became agitated when tried to be weaned off the ventilator. She is currently on haloperidol and quetiapine for agitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with gastroparesis, s/p esophagectomy and with signficiant
   COPD admit to ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure likley secondary
   to aspiraiton and superinfection with GNR's.  She has had some capacity
   to tolerate PSV at this time but retains
   Some significant ventilatory requirement.  Of note as well is chest
   tube has minimal drainage but persistent air leak.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Secondary to aspiraiton, pneumonia and underlying
   COPD.  She has Ve-7.5 and RR=16 suggesting reasonable compliance and
   tolerance of PSV wean.  Secretions remain limited.  RSBI <105 this
   morning
   -Will trial on SBT after 60 minutes with 7/0 and check ABG at that time
   -Vanco/Gent/Zosyn continuing
   -Atrovent to continue
   -Hope to trial extubation later today based upon response to SBT
   -Wean sedation this morning and tiral haldol this morning
   2)Pneumonia-
   Vanco/Zosyn
   3)Pneumothorax-
   -Chest tube with one chamber leak this morning on water seal
   -Hemodynamics not changed this morning
   -Would favor water seal until leak is resolved
   -Will discuss with T-[**Doctor First Name **]
   -Given emphysema and likely bullous disease may have to consider
   pleuradhesis if leak not resolving
   3)Gastroparesis-
   Reglan
   4)Agitation-
   Haldol/Zyprexa

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of gastroparesis, esophagectomy, and significant COPD.
- She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration and superinfection with Gram-negative rods (GNR's).
- The patient has shown some capacity to tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) but still requires significant ventilatory support.
- She has a chest tube with minimal drainage but persistent air leak.
- The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) below 105 this morning.
- She will be undergoing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) after 60 minutes with 7 liters of oxygen, and her ABG will be checked at that time.
- Current medications include vancomycin, gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam, atrovent, and heparin sodium.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX .  Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+
   budding yeast c/w aspiration PNA, covered by zosyn and vancomycin.
   Continues on PS. Did not do well with SBT and continues to have
   moderate thick secretions. It is unlikely SBT failed d/t agitation as
   before since she was pretreated w/haldol.
   - F/u speciation on culture data
   - attempt to wean sedation and decrease FiO2.
   - Follow PTX on CXR, to water seal if leak stopped
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -          Continue haldol PRN
   -          Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Shock: Patient in shock likely [**3-3**] urosepsis & gram negative
   aspiration PNA. Echocardiogram with EF >55% and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12 and adequate UOP
   - speciate GNR in sputum and adjust coverage as needed
   - vanco/zosyn (day 3 and 6 respectively)
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  Air leak noted on low suction, will
   follow final read of CXR and if no pneumo will try again to put on
   water seal.
   - chest tube to low suction
   - check CXR this PM
   - f/u thoracic recs
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with restarting metoprolol.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Previously in this admission with mild
   iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Baseline hematocrit 30-35.
   Currently 23 in the setting of significant IV fluid administration,
   however her hct has trended down since admission. Has been guaiac + but
   this has been her baseline and there is question whether this is caused
   by irritation at the J-tube site. Will transfuse as needed for now if
   needed; she is hemodynamically stable.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   - active type and screen
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once medications weaned

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with several medical conditions including COPD, esophageal perforation post esophagectomy, severe gastroparesis, tension pneumothorax, multifocal atrial tachycardia, chronic blood loss anemia, chronic back pain with compression fractures, and malnutrition.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation due to severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia. She also had right-sided stable pneumothorax and was found to have 3+ GNR and 2+ budding yeast in her sputum, consistent with aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 96/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 336 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 89.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.4 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, slightly low platelet count of 349 K/uL, and low albumin level of"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on water seal..  Sputum with
   3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast c/w aspiration PNA, covered by zosyn and
   vancomycin.  Continues on PS. Did not do well with SBT and continues to
   have moderate thick secretions. Will reassess again this morning for
   potential extubation later today.
   - F/u speciation on culture data
   - attempt to wean sedation and decrease FiO2
   -if appropriate, extubate today.
   - Follow PTX on CXR this afternoon
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Shock: Patient in shock likely [**3-3**] urosepsis & gram negative
   aspiration PNA. Echocardiogram with EF >55% and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - continue fluid boluses; goal CVP 10-12 and adequate UOP
   - speciate GNR in sputum and adjust coverage as needed
   - vanco/zosyn (day 3 and 6 respectively)
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Now s/p decompression and chest tube placement
   with good re-expansion on CXR.  Air leak noted on low suction, will
   follow on  CXR.
   - chest tube to water seal
   - check CXR this PM
   - f/u thoracic recs
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with restarting metoprolol.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. If extubated will need to be switched to eithe PO or IV
   pain meds (if fentanyl/medazolam is switched off prior to extubation).
   - continue fentanyl for sedation
   - reassess pain regimen once sedation weaned

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, who was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She has undergone an esophagectomy and is now presenting with severe gastroparesis. The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which was exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia. She also has a right-sided stable pneumothorax and is on water seal. Sputum cultures show 3+ GNR and 2+ budding yeast, indicating aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's agitation has improved with the use of Haldol and Seroquel. She is currently in shock, likely due to urosepsis and gram-negative aspiration pneumonia. An echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction >55% and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The patient had a tension pneumothorax, which has been decompressed and a chest tube placed. The chest tube is currently on water seal, and further evaluation will be done on a chest X-ray.

The patient is also experiencing multifocal atrial tachycardia, which has improved with the restarting of metoprolol. She has a history of gastroparesis, nausea, and malnutrition. The patient is absorbing nutrients through the transgastric route and will continue with adjustments in nutrition recommendations. Follow-up with nutrition recommendations is advised.

The patient's chronic blood loss anemia is stable, and initial concerns for a GI bleed have been ruled out"

   Imaging: CXR--mild decrease in pulmonary opacities
   Assessment and Plan
   66yo female with history of COPD and s/p esophagectomy following
   perforation and now admit to ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure and
   peri-intubation period complicated by pneumothorax and hypotension.
   She has had difficulty with weaning from ventilatory support with
   significant tachypnea resulting with wean from PSV.  This incapacity to
   wean may well be related to significant dynamic hyperinflation with
   airflow obstruction resulting in mechanical disadvantage in the setting
   of chronic obstructive lung disease.  In addition, pulmonary edema,
   restriction from chest wall mechanics all must be considered for the
   rapid shallow breathing pattern identified.  Her agitation does appear
   to be well controlled and this does appear to be true persistence of
   ventilatory failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   Vanco/Zosyn
   Haldol PRN
   Continued negative fluid balance today
   This morning she has very favorable findings to suggest possible
   successful liberation from ventilation
   Extubation today and will move to BIPAP support post extubation on an
   overnight and as needed basis.
   Hold TF
s for extubation
   HR well controlled with digoxin and beta blocker
   2)Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease-
   Continue with albuterol/atrovent
   Will have to auscultate for possible obstruction post extubation
   3)Hypotension-
   Improved, tolerating diuresis
   Continue Vanco/Zosyn for Rx of possible pulmonary infection
   Continue to follow BP
   Will maintain bacground pain control
   4)Pneumothorax-
   F/U CXR after tube to water seal today
   Hope for resolution with extubation completed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD who underwent an esophagectomy due to perforation. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure and had difficulty weaning from ventilatory support. The patient's condition has been complicated by a pneumothorax and hypotension. She has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 116/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, pantoprazole, and vancomycin/Zosyn. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.4 K/uL and elevated troponin T levels at 0.05 ng/mL. Imaging reveals a mild decrease in pulmonary opacities on chest X-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent difficulty weaning from ventilatory support suggests ongoing respiratory failure. Factors contributing to this may include dynamic hyperinflation, airflow obstruction due to COPD, pulmonary edema, and chest wall mechanics restriction.
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, who was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She had undergone an esophagectomy and developed severe gastroparesis. The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia. She also had a right-sided tension pneumothorax, which has been treated with chest tube placement and is now on water seal. The patient's sputum culture showed ESBL Klebsiella, for which she is receiving treatment with Zosyn (moderate sensitivity). She is also on vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is improving on non-invasive ventilation. She has a history of agitation, which has improved with haloperidol and quetiapine. The patient's nutritional status is a concern due to gastroparesis, but she is absorbing nutrients through total parenteral nutrition (TF). She has chronic anemia due to chronic blood loss, possibly from irritation at the J-tube site. She has severe emphysema and is receiving nebulizers and oxygen therapy. The patient has multiple thoracic compression fractures with chronic back pain. She is on a fentanyl patch and liquid morphine for pain management. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on prophylactic heparin and PPI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. She has been extubated and is currently on invasive ventilation, but it has been stopped intermittently. The patient has been experiencing pain at her baseline and has been put on her home regimen of pain medication, including Fentanyl patch. She also has an ESBL Klebsiella infection in her sputum, for which she is receiving treatment with Zosyn. The patient had a supraventricular tachycardia episode yesterday and her beta blocker dose has been increased. 

The patient has allergies to codeine, which caused hives. She has received various antibiotics including gentamicin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She is currently on multiple ICU medications such as pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/59 mmHg to 160/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on water seal..  Sputum with
   3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast c/w aspiration PNA now growing ESBL
   kleibsiella, moderate sensitive to zosyn; also on vancomycin. Extubated
   yesterday; doing well on 2 L NC. Afebrile; VS stable. Unchanged CXR.
   - Patient improving on Zosyn; if decompensates will start meropenem
   (day [**5-8**] of Vancomuycin and Zosyn respectively)
   - F/u remaining cultures.
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on water seal without any drainage
   or air leak. Will be pulled out today by IP.
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday sisnce she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   - continue fentanyl patch and liquid morphine per [**Hospital1 1023**].

   66 yo female with significant COPD now admit with acute respiratory
   failure in the setting of likely combination of aspiration and mucus
   plugging with Klebsiella from [**2142-10-19**] culture now showing evidence of
   significant bacterial infection.  She has had substantial improvement
   over time and now is extubated and returned to 2 lpm O2
   supplementation.  The pneumothorax does appear to be controlled with CT
   in place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted with acute respiratory failure. She had an invasive ventilation, but was successfully extubated without any events. The patient has shown improvement over time and is currently on 2 lpm O2 supplementation. She also has evidence of a significant bacterial infection, likely Klebsiella pneumoniae, for which Vancomycin and Zosyn are being continued. The patient's current plan includes ambulating, using incentive spirometry, and maintaining a negative fluid balance. She also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a resolved pneumothorax, and chronic pain, for which Dilaudid and a fentanyl patch are being used.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could worsen if she experiences further complications such as pneumonia or mucus plugging.
2. Hospital-Acquired Infection: The patient is at risk for acquiring additional infections, particularly given her prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.
3. Enterococcal UTI: The presence of an enterococcal urinary tract infection may require consideration of discontinuing Vancomycin.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD could exacerbate, leading to further respiratory distress.
5. Pneumothorax Recurrence: Although the current pneumothorax appears to be resolved, there is a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on suction for post-pulling
   chest tube. Drained 10cc in 24 hours. Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding
   yeast c/w aspiration PNA now growing ESBL kleibsiella, moderate
   sensitive to zosyn; also on vancomycin. Extubated yesterday; doing well
   on 2 L NC. Afebrile; VS stable. Unchanged CXR.
   - Switch to Pressure support [**11-4**] and ABGs afterwards
   - Patient improving on Zosyn; if decompensates will start meropenem
   (day [**6-7**])
   - F/u remaining cultures.
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on suction without air leak or
   drainage. Will change it to water seal today. We need to consider
   pleurodesis after prior failed attempt of removal.
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   - continue fentanyl patch and liquid morphine per PEG.
   # FEN: TF, IVF, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: SC  heparin, [**Hospital1 **], PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. She had undergone an esophagectomy and developed severe gastroparesis. The patient also has chronic back pain with compression fractures and chronic blood loss anemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD was exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia. She also had a right-sided stable pneumothorax, which was drained but with minimal fluid output.
2. Tension pneumothorax: The patient's chest tube was placed on suction without air leak or drainage, and it will be changed to water seal today. There is a consideration for pleurodesis due to the failed attempt at removing the chest tube.
3. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The patient's heart rate improved with metoprolol, but she continues to have episodes of tachycardia. Digoxin and increased doses of metoprolol are being continued.
4. Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition: The patient has been shown to be absorbing nutrients through the transverse colon, so adjustments to nutrition recommendations are being made. Residuals will be monitored.
5. Chronic blood loss anemia: The patient initially had a concern for GI bleed, but this appears to be a baseline issue potentially due to irritation at the Jtube site."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on suction for post-pulling
   chest tube. Drained 10cc in 24 hours. Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding
   yeast c/w aspiration PNA now growing ESBL kleibsiella, moderate
   sensitive to zosyn; also on vancomycin. Extubated yesterday; doing well
   on 2 L NC. Afebrile; VS stable. Unchanged CXR.
   - Switch to Pressure support [**11-4**] and ABGs afterwards
   - Patient improving on Zosyn; if decompensates will start meropenem
   (day [**6-7**])
   - F/u remaining cultures.
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on suction without air leak or
   drainage. Will change it to water seal today. We need to consider
   pleurodesis after prior failed attempt of removal.
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   - continue fentanyl patch and liquid morphine per PEG.
   # FEN: TF, IVF, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: SC  heparin, [**Hospital1 **], PPI

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has undergone an esophagectomy and has severe gastroparesis. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia. She also has a right-sided stable pneumothorax and has had a chest tube placed. The patient's sputum culture showed growth of ESBL Klebsiella, which is moderately sensitive to Zosyn. She is currently on vancomycin as well.

2. Agitation: The patient's agitation has improved with the use of haloperidol and quetiapine. It is recommended to continue these medications on an as-needed basis.

3. Tension pneumothorax: The patient's chest tube is currently on suction without air leak or drainage. It is planned to change it to water seal today. Considering the failed attempt at removal, pleurodesis may be considered.

4. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is currently in the 70s and has improved with metoprolol. The dose of metoprolol should be increased if the patient's blood pressure tolerates it. Continuing with digoxin is also recommended.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a young female with a history of significant COPD and post-esophagectomy. She has been experiencing discomfort and was found to have gastric ileus. The patient has had recurrent respiratory failure despite significant improvement, which may be related to the recurrence of pneumothorax or persistence of pneumothorax not visualized on the plain film performed prior to the removal of the chest tube.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory distress and potential hypoxemia.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax, which can cause collapsed lung and difficulty in breathing. If left untreated or if the chest tube becomes dislodged, the pneumothorax can recur, leading to repeated episodes of respiratory failure.

3. Gastroparesis: The patient has gastric ileus, which indicates delayed emptying of the stomach contents. This can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and other complications related to poor gastrointestinal motility.

4. Pain: The patient is experiencing pain, which is currently being managed with IV pain control. Insufficient pain management can lead to agitation, increased risk of complications, and impaired respiratory function.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, including ongoing ventilation support and careful removal of"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on suction for post-pulling
   chest tube. Previous Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast c/w
   aspiration PNA with ESBL kleibsiella; also on vancomycin. Extubated
   yesterday then had to be reintubated for respiratory failure.
   - sputum culture
   - change zosyn to meropenem for improved coverage today would be [**7-8**] if
   count from beginning of zosyn, otherwise [**10-26**] is now new day 1
   - F/u remaining cultures.
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on suction without air leak or
   drainage. Will change it to water seal today. We need to consider
   pleurodesis after prior failed attempt of removal.
   - touch base with thoracic surgery regarding plan for chest tube
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals.
   - as per nursing OG tube is in incorrect place, nursing will try to
   place again, otherwise we will try
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   - continue fentanyl patch and liquid morphine per PEG.
   # FEN: TF, replete electrolytes (gave IV magnesium and neutraphos this
   morning)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of complicated gastrointestinal issues, including an esophagectomy, and advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress requiring emergent intubation. The patient's course has been complicated by a pneumothorax following the insertion of a right subclavian insertion. 

The patient's recent events include invasive ventilation being stopped and then restarted due to respiratory failure. She experienced increased secretions, labored breathing, hypoxia, and hypercarbia, leading to reintubation. The chest x-ray showed the endotracheal tube ending at the carina, and it was decided to pull back the tube. 

The patient has allergies to codeine, which caused hives. She has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and piperacillin. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/57 mmHg to 162/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent respiratory issues. 

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has been receiving IV fluids and has had a blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including a recent esophagectomy, advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and severe gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and required emergent intubation. The patient experienced complications such as pneumothorax following right subclavian insertion, increased risk of aspiration (RISBI), laryngeal edema, and reintubation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 122/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and various ICU medications. She is also receiving nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TF).

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. Her chest X-ray shows no significant changes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia. She also has a right-sided stable pneumothorax that is being treated with chest tube drainage.
2. Agitation: The patient's agitation has improved with the use of haloperidol and quetiapine. Continue haloperidol as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a complicated gastrointestinal history post esophagectomy, advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent pneumothorax due to right subclavian insertion. She was transferred from the floor with acute respiratory distress and required emergent intubation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple episodes of increased fentanyl and pain control, possible laryngeal edema, wheezing, and tons of secretions. She had labored breathing, hypoxia, and hypercarbia, necessitating reintubation with the tube pulled out 2cm from its original position.

The patient has allergies to codeine, which causes hives, and has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and piperacillin alone. She is currently on infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (Versed). Other ICU medications include hydromorphone (Dilaudid) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged except for the recent events. Review of systems is also unchanged from admission.

Vital signs and flow sheet data indicate the patient's temperature (Tmax) is 37.3°C (99.2°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) is 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate (HR"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on suction for post-pulling
   chest tube. Drained 10cc in 24 hours. Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding
   yeast c/w aspiration PNA now growing ESBL kleibsiella, moderate
   sensitive to zosyn; also on vancomycin. Extubated yesterday; doing well
   on 2 L NC. Afebrile; VS stable. Unchanged CXR.
   - Switch to Pressure support [**11-4**] and ABGs afterwards
   - Patient improving on Zosyn; if decompensates will start meropenem
   (day [**6-7**])
   - F/u remaining cultures.
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on suction without air leak or
   drainage. Will change it to water seal today. We need to consider
   pleurodesis after prior failed attempt of removal.
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals.
   - f/u nutrition recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   - continue fentanyl patch and liquid morphine per PEG.

The patient has been treated for various complications, such as hypoxic respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia, tension pneumothorax, multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition, chronic blood loss anemia, and chronic back pain/compression fractures.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and responds to commands.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, sodium level of 139 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 24.8%, blood urea nitrogen level of 29 mg/dL, glucose level of 91 mg/dL, and platelet count of 484 thousand/mm3. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is currently on several medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through total parenteral nutrition (TF).

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory distress, infection due to prolonged intubation, development of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with severe chronic obstructive lung disease now with
   recurrent acute in the setting of chronic respiratory failure.  The
   source of the chronic failure is her chronic obstructive lung disease.
   Her acute need for re-intubation initially was related to pneumonthorax
   and resulting tachypnea, dynamic hyperinflation and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure. Upon second re-intubation patient evolved
   significant hypoxemic respiratory compromise and evolution of left
   sided pulmonary opacities and effusion.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Acute-primarily hypoxemic at this time
   -Will need PSV to continue and have continued support until new
   stability can be established.  For specific interventions
   -Pneumonthorax
chest tube to suction
   -COPD
Continue with PSV support and if extubation attempted will need
   to extubate to Non-invasive Ventilation
   -Upper Airway Edema
This in combiantion with likely COPD exacerbation
   will make for systemic steroids being indicated
   -Pnuemonia-_Vanco/Meropenem for renewed coverage with concern for
   ventilatory associated pneumonia
   -If not favorable for extubation will have to consider tracheostomy for
   long term support.
   -If re-extubated will need to be extubated to non-invasive ventilation
   2)Pneumonthorax-
   -maintain suction
   3)Nutrition-
   -will need to obtain Gi access for feeds and will attempt to place OGT
   for feeds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) experiencing recurrent acute exacerbations in the setting of chronic respiratory failure. The source of the chronic failure is her COPD. The patient has had multiple intubations due to pneumothorax and resulting tachypnea, dynamic hyperinflation, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is acute respiratory failure, primarily hypoxemic. She will need pressure support ventilation (PSV) to continue and have continued support until new stability can be established. Specific interventions include:

1. Respiratory Failure-Acute-primarily hypoxemic at this time:
- PSV support until new stability is established.
- Pneumothorax: Chest tube to suction.
- COPD: Continue with PSV support and if extubation attempted, will need to extubate to non-invasive ventilation.
- Upper Airway Edema: Systemic steroids may be indicated due to likely COPD exacerbation.
- Pneumonia: Vancomycin/Meropenem for renewed coverage with concern for ventilatory associated pneumonia.
- If not favorable for extubation, consider tracheostomy for long-term support.
- If re-extubated, need to extubate to non-invasive ventilation.

2. Pneumothorax: Maintain suction.

3. Nutrition: Obtain GI access for feeds and attempt to place"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on suction for post-pulling
   chest tube. Previous Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast c/w
   aspiration PNA with ESBL kleibsiella; also on vancomycin.
   Self-extubated this morning. Will likely need to be reintubated once
   sedated, as pt noted this would be ok with her.
   - f/u cultures
   - change zosyn to meropenem for improved coverage today would be [**7-8**] if
   count from beginning of zosyn, otherwise [**10-26**] is now new day 1
   -reintubation ? today
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on suction today. Follow up with
   thoracic as to when we can switch to water seal.
   - touch base with thoracic surgery regarding plan for chest tube
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. OG not in right place, taken out
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophageal perforation, and severe gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and intubation due to severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has a right-sided stable pneumothorax with a chest tube in place and previous sputum culture showing growth of GNR and budding yeast consistent with aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/49-150/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 388 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated with meropenem for improved antibiotic coverage.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, tension pneumothorax, multifocal atr"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on suction for post-pulling
   chest tube. Previous Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast c/w
   aspiration PNA with ESBL kleibsiella treated with meropenem.
   Self-extubated this morning. Will likely need to be reintubated however
   initially patient said this was ok if she was adequeately sedated, now
   saying she doesn
t want to be reintubated at all. Currently on shovel
   mask doing well.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue meropenem (started yesterday)
   -discuss w/patient her goals and whether intubation/trach would be next
   step if she is in respiratory distress
   -currently off sedation
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel. Patient appeared tearful this
   AM. Would benefit from psych evalutation to ensure she has capacity to
   make decisions regarding her health and that depression and anxiety
   [**Male First Name (un) **]
t play a role. She is currently on haldol only as needed and
   quetiapine which have helped with her agitation. However we may not be
   treating her anxiety and/or depression adequately. Also with patients
   family concerned and not certain what is best, there is some conflict
   as to whether she needs to be reintubated.
   -psych consult
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on suction today. Follow up with
   thoracic as to when we can switch to water seal.
   - thoracic surgery regarding plan for chest tube
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. Will not pursue NG tube at this
   point.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   -          may need to rethink her pain medication as this is patients
   main complaint, will redoes her PO medications
   -          if not reintubated on sedation, continue fentanyl patch.

   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on suction for post-pulling
   chest tube. Previous Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast c/w
   aspiration PNA with ESBL kleibsiella; also on vancomycin.
   Self-extubated this morning. Will likely need to be reintubated once
   sedated, as pt noted this would be ok with her.
   - f/u cultures
   - change zosyn to meropenem for improved coverage today would be [**7-8**] if
   count from beginning of zosyn, otherwise [**10-26**] is now new day 1
   -reintubation ? today
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel.
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on suction today. Follow up with
   thoracic as to when we can switch to water seal.
   - touch base with thoracic surgery regarding plan for chest tube
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. OG not in right place, taken out
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   - continue fentanyl patch and liquid morphine per PEG.
   # FEN: TF, replete electrolytes (gave IV magnesium and neutraphos this
   morning)
   # Prophylaxis: SC  heparin, [**Hospital1 **], PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with several medical conditions and complications. She has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has a history of COPD, esophageal perforation post esophagectomy, and severe gastroparesis. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 77 bpm (normal range: 75-108 bpm), blood pressure of 114/49 mmHg (with a previous range of 65-150/44-90 mmHg), respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute (normal range: 9-20 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including codeine, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), piperacillin, meropenem, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The results also indicate abnormalities in creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), electrolytes (Na+/K+/Mg++/PO4), and other parameters.

The patient's chest X-ray shows right-sided stable pneumothorax (PTX) on suction for post-pulling chest tube. 

The patient's assessment and plan include several medical issues: hypoxic respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia, right-sided tension pneumothorax with chest tube on suction, agitation, multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition, chronic blood loss anemia, severe emphysema contributing to respiratory failure, chronic back pain/compression fractures, total parenteral nutrition (TF), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax leading to further respiratory compromise, development of antibiotic resistance due to prolonged antibiotic use, malnutrition due to gastroparesis and inability to eat normally, bleeding due to chronic blood loss anemia, and worsening of COPD symptoms.

Please note that the patient's condition may change over time, and it is crucial to closely monitor her progress and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

   This evening, pt remains extubated, high FiO2 requirement, suctioned
   vigorously earlier in the day and less congested. Remains high risk for
   re-intubation. Will check ABG later tonight with initiation of NIPPV if
   developing hypercarbia or increased work of breathing.
   After extubation, pt voiced to RN her wish not to be further intubated
   or to undergo trach. Her family remains in conflict over this decision,
   with varying opinions for DNI vs. re-intubate vs. trach. Psych consult
   sought who stated that pt currently not capable of making her own
   decisions. She remains full code and will try to meet with family
   tomorrow.
   Pt remains critically ill.

   Subsequently, pt developed worsening resp distress with increased work
   of breathing and hypercarbia on blood gas. Discussed NIPPV, but did not
   pursue due to secretions. Re-intubated. CXR post-intubation pending. Of
   note during earlier suctioning, bile contents recovered.

   developing hypercarbia or increased work of breathing.
   After extubation, pt voiced to RN her wish not to be further intubated
   or to undergo trach. Her family remains in conflict over this decision,
   with varying opinions for DNI vs. re-intubate vs. trach. Psych consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with COPD, gastroparesis, chronic pain, and respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and has had a complicated course including pneumothorax (PTX), two failed extubations, and aspiration. The patient self-extubated this morning but remains in a tenuous respiratory status. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with high levels of FiO2 and has been suctioned vigorously. The patient's family is in conflict over her code status, with varying opinions on whether she should be intubated again, undergo a tracheostomy, or have a do-not-intubate (DNI) status. A psychiatric consultation has been requested to assess the patient's decision-making capacity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, and she may require re-intubation.
2. Pneumothorax (PTX): The patient has had recurrent PTX, which can lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration risk is high due to her COPD and previous extubations.
4. Gastroparesis: The patient has gastroparesis, which can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory response.
6. Code Status Conflict: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration
   pneumonia. Also with R sided stable PTX on suction for post-pulling
   chest tube. Previous Sputum with 3+GNR and 2+ budding yeast c/w
   aspiration PNA with ESBL kleibsiella treated with meropenem.
   Self-extubated this morning. Will likely need to be reintubated however
   initially patient said this was ok if she was adequeately sedated, now
   saying she doesn
t want to be reintubated at all. Currently on shovel
   mask doing well.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue meropenem (started yesterday)
   -discuss w/patient her goals and whether intubation/trach would be next
   step if she is in respiratory distress
   -currently off sedation
   # Agitation: Improved w/haldol, seroquel. Patient appeared tearful this
   AM. Would benefit from psych evalutation to ensure she has capacity to
   make decisions regarding her health and that depression and anxiety
   [**Male First Name (un) **]
t play a role. She is currently on haldol only as needed and
   quetiapine which have helped with her agitation. However we may not be
   treating her anxiety and/or depression adequately. Also with patients
   family concerned and not certain what is best, there is some conflict
   as to whether she needs to be reintubated.
   -psych consult
   -Continue haldol PRN
   -Continue Quetitapine PRN
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Chest tube on suction today. Follow up with
   thoracic as to when we can switch to water seal.
   - thoracic surgery regarding plan for chest tube
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. Will not pursue NG tube at this
   point.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   -          may need to rethink her pain medication as this is patients
   main complaint, will redoes her PO medications
   -          if not reintubated on sedation, continue fentanyl patch.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophageal perforation post esophagectomy, and severe gastroparesis. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has a right-sided stable pneumothorax on suction and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient self-extubated this morning but required reintubation a few hours later. She is currently on a shovel mask and doing well. The plan is to continue meropenem (started yesterday), discuss the patient's goals regarding intubation/tracheostomy, and perform a psych evaluation to ensure she has the capacity to make decisions about her health.

The patient's agitation has improved with haldol and seroquel, but her anxiety and depression may not be adequately treated. There is conflict among the patient's family regarding the need for reintubation. A psych consult is planned.

The patient has a tension pneumothorax, for which a chest tube was placed on suction today. Follow-up with thoracic surgery regarding the plan for chest tube removal is needed.

The patient is experiencing multifocal atrial tachycardia, which has improved with metoprolol. Digoxin will be continued, and the metoprolol dose may be increased if her blood pressure tolerates it.

The patient has gastroparesis, nausea, and malnutrition. She is absorbing nutrients through the tube feeding (TF), so adjustments per nutrition recommendations will be made. Residuals will be monitored, and a nasogastric (NG) tube will not be pursued at this point.

The patient has chronic blood loss anemia, which is stable over the last couple of days. Initially, concern for GI bleed was raised due to positive guaiacs, but this may be a baseline issue, potentially due to irritation at the Jtube site. Serial hematocrits will be monitored, and a transfusion goal of less than 21 will be targeted.

The patient has severe emphysema at baseline, which is a significant contributor to her respiratory failure. Nebulizers will be continued, and oxygen will be titrated for saturation levels greater than 88-94%.

The patient also has chronic back pain and compression fractures in the thoracic region. Orthopedics has determined that kyphoplasty is not necessary. The patient will be put back on her home pain management regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia.
2. Tension pneumothorax.
3. Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
4. Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition.
5. Chronic blood loss anemia.

   aspiration PNA with recent left side iatrogenic PTX. She had 3 +GNR in
   sputum and 2+ budding yeasts and cultures with ESBL kleibsiella.
   Patient on day 3 of meropenem. Patient has required re-intubation 3
   times so far for multiple reasons. Patient with copious secretions,
   from GI tract and now very sedated.
   -          f/u cultures
   -          Continue meropenem (Day [**4-7**])
   -          Discuss goals of care with family; she qualifies for
   tracheostomy and possibly to pleurodesis. However, it would depend in
   what her wishes are. Right now she is delirious and unable to make a
   decision or understand the consequences of it.
   .
   # Agitation: Improved with haldol and seroquel. However, yesterday
   patient very delirious after she self-extuabted. Patient has multiple
   reasons to be delirious such as being in the ICU, PNA, intensive pain
   control regimen, etc. Right now will continue haldol and seroquel PRN.

   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Then, PTX recurred after chest tube was taken out. Now
   resolved on CXR, no leaking on the chest tube nor drainage in the last
   24 hours. However, she may be candidate for pleurodesis at this point.
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with COPD who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She had an esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis, and is now experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia and iatrogenic pneumothorax. The patient has copious secretions and is very sedated. She has been intubated multiple times and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient also has delirium, agitation, tension pneumothorax, multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis, chronic blood loss anemia, severe emphysema, chronic back pain with compression fractures, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and possible aspiration pneumonia may lead to ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirious state can affect her ability to make decisions and understand the consequences of them.
3. Tension pneumothorax: Although the patient's tension pneumothorax has resolved, she may still be a candidate for pleurodesis.
4. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 70s and needs to be monitored and managed with medication.
5. Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition: The patient's absorption issues and malnutrition need to be addressed through nutrition recommendations and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophagectomy, chronic pain, and gastroparesis. She has been experiencing respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient has had multiple extubations and reintubations, with ongoing aspiration due to gastroparesis. She also has an infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient's family is at odds regarding her future goals of care, as she is not deemed competent to make decisions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD, ongoing aspiration, and infection with ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia contribute to her respiratory failure. These factors make it unlikely for her to become independent from mechanical ventilation soon. Optimizing all aggravating factors, including continuing antibiotics and inhalers, will be important.

2. GI Bleed: The patient continues to have coffee grounds GI bleed. She is currently on PPI therapy, and the dosage will be changed to [Hospital1] dosing. Her Hct should be rechecked.

3. Malnutrition: The patient has not been receiving her goal total parenteral nutrition (TF) due to repeated extubations and reintubations. It is planned to introduce TF at a low rate, with a transition to TPN in [Month (only) 8].

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple complications requiring ongoing management in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophagectomy, chronic pain, and gastroparesis. She presented with respiratory failure and required invasive ventilation. The patient has had multiple episodes of self-extubation and re-intubation due to her lack of decision-making capacity. She also has ongoing aspiration in the setting of gastroparesis, an ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia, and a loculated effusion. The patient's respiratory failure is likely to be chronic, and there is a disagreement among the family members regarding the goals of care. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, GI bleed, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD, ongoing aspiration, ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia, and loculated effusion contribute to her respiratory failure. This condition may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. GI Bleed: The patient continues to have coffee-ground GI bleed. This could worsen and lead to significant blood loss, anemia, and potential cardiovascular instability.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to meet her nutritional requirements due to repeated extubation/intubations may result in further weight loss, muscle wasting, and impaired healing.
4. Infection: The presence of ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia indicates an infection that may not be fully controlled by antibiotics"

   1. Respiratory failure: contributing factors:
   *Ongoing aspiration in the setting of continued gastroparesis
   *ESBL Klebsiella PNA
   *Loculated effusion
   *Underlying COPD
   *[**Name (NI) 1186**] PTX on chest tube
   Now requiring mech ventilation over ~10 days. Likelihood of soon being
   independent of MV low given above factors. Will continue to optimize
   all aggravating factors
   -continue Meripneme for Klebsiella
   *continue inhalers, CT to water seal
   - A major issue remains future goals given low liklihood of soon being
   independent from mech ventilation. Family has been at odds regarding
   goals, and though pt voiced yesterday a desire to avoid further
   invasive support , not deemed competent by Psych.
   -Will set up family meeting
   -Hold on further plans (e.g. pleurodesis) until further clarified
   whether goals more comfort vs trach/pleurodesis +/- TPN
   2. GI bleed: continues to have coffee grds, though amount unchanged
   relatively throughout hospitalization
   On PPI- change to [**Hospital1 **] dosing. Re check Hct

   20 minutes spent updating family this afternoon.
   Spoke with pt
s daughter and 2 sisters about pt
s re-intubation last
   night, the multiple co-morbidities that have contibuted to her
   continued need for mechanical ventilation and low likeihood of her
   being able to breathe independently. They are well aware of her current
   circumstances, but report that the pt
s husband and son remain hopeful
   that Mrs. [**Known lastname 852**] will turn the corner and improve, based more so on
   acute events (was off the ventilator yesterday) rather than long term
   course. Though daughter is health care proxy, this difference in
   opinion amongst family members makes it hard for her to make major
   medical decisions for her mother. The patient
s son and husband were
   not here today and I was unable to talk to them. Have urged meeting
   with ICU team, with all family members present to discuss pt
s long

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient with severe COPD and possible
   aspiration PNA with recent left side iatrogenic PTX. She had 3 +GNR in
   sputum and 2+ budding yeasts and cultures with ESBL kleibsiella.
   Patient on day 3 of meropenem. Patient has required re-intubation 3
   times so far for multiple reasons. Patient with copious secretions,
   from GI tract and now very sedated.
   -          f/u cultures
   -          Continue meropenem (Day [**4-7**])
   -          Discuss goals of care with family; she qualifies for
   tracheostomy and possibly to pleurodesis. However, it would depend in
   what her wishes are. Right now she is delirious and unable to make a
   decision or understand the consequences of it.
   .
   # Agitation: Improved with haldol and seroquel. However, yesterday
   patient very delirious after she self-extuabted. Patient has multiple
   reasons to be delirious such as being in the ICU, PNA, intensive pain
   control regimen, etc. Right now will continue haldol and seroquel PRN.
   Seen by psychiatry yesterday
   -F/u psych recs
   -Continue haldol seroquel for now
   .
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Then, PTX recurred after chest tube was taken out. Now
   resolved on CXR, no leaking on the chest tube nor drainage in the last
   24 hours. However, she may be candidate for pleurodesis at this point.
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. Will not pursue NG tube at this
   point.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   -          may need to rethink her pain medication as this is patients
   main complaint, will redoes her PO medications
   -          if not reintubated on sedation, continue fentanyl patch.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophageal perforation, and severe gastroparesis. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia and a left-sided iatrogenic pneumothorax. She also has copious secretions from the GI tract and is very sedated.

The patient has been diagnosed with agitation, tension pneumothorax (resolved), multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition, chronic blood loss anemia, severe emphysema (COPD), chronic back pain/compression fractures, and replete electrolytes. She is currently on multiple medications, including meropenem, haldol, seroquel, metoprolol, digoxin, calcium, vitamin D, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further episodes of tension pneumothorax, development of delirium or agitation, electrolyte imbalances, and complications related to her underlying conditions such as COPD, gastroparesis, and anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient with severe COPD and possible
   aspiration PNA with recent left side iatrogenic PTX. She had 3 +GNR in
   sputum and 2+ budding yeasts and cultures with ESBL kleibsiella.
   Patient on day 3 of meropenem. Patient has required re-intubation 3
   times so far for multiple reasons. Patient with copious secretions,
   from GI tract and now very sedated.
   -          f/u cultures
   -          Continue meropenem (Day [**4-7**])
   -          Discuss goals of care with family; she qualifies for
   tracheostomy and possibly to pleurodesis. However, it would depend in
   what her wishes are. Right now she is delirious and unable to make a
   decision or understand the consequences of it.
   .
   # Agitation: Improved with haldol and seroquel. However, yesterday
   patient very delirious after she self-extuabted. Patient has multiple
   reasons to be delirious such as being in the ICU, PNA, intensive pain
   control regimen, etc. Right now will continue haldol and seroquel PRN.
   Seen by psychiatry yesterday
   -F/u psych recs
   -Continue haldol seroquel for now
   .
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Then, PTX recurred after chest tube was taken out. Now
   resolved on CXR, no leaking on the chest tube nor drainage in the last
   24 hours. However, she may be candidate for pleurodesis at this point.
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. Will not pursue NG tube at this
   point.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  Stable over last couple of days.
   Initially concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but apparently
   this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t irritation at Jtube site.
   Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   -          may need to rethink her pain medication as this is patients
   main complaint, will redoes her PO medications
   -          if not reintubated on sedation, continue fentanyl patch.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with COPD, esophageal perforation, and severe gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has a history of multiple complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, possible aspiration pneumonia, iatrogenic pneumothorax, copious secretions, delirium, agitation, and tension pneumothorax. She also has multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis, chronic blood loss anemia, severe emphysema, chronic back pain, and compression fractures. The patient's current medications include codeine, meropenem, midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and a proton pump inhibitor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and possible aspiration pneumonia put her at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Delirium: The patient's current delirious state may be due to multiple factors such as being in the ICU, pneumonia, intensive pain control regimen, etc.
3. Tension pneumothorax: Although the patient's tension pneumothorax is currently resolved, there is a possibility of recurrence.
4. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 13 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 400 mL. Oxygen delivery is through an endotracheal tube with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient's blood gases indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 53 mmHg, and PaO2 of 108 mmHg. The patient's laboratory values are within normal ranges, except for elevated levels of AST and ALT. The patient has received multiple doses of codeine, meropenem, midazolam, and fentanyl.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's ICU stay and critical condition increase the risk of developing stress ulcers.
4. Delirium: The patient's medication regimen and ICU environment may contribute to the development of delirium.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient with severe COPD and possible
   aspiration PNA with recent left side iatrogenic PTX. She had 3 +GNR in
   sputum and 2+ budding yeasts and cultures with ESBL kleibsiella.
   Patient on day 4 of meropenem. Patient has required re-intubation 3
   times, and will likely continue to be difficult to extubate.. Patient
   with copious secretions, from GI tract and now very sedated.
   -          f/u cultures
   -          Continue meropenem (Day [**4-7**])
   -          Discuss goals of care with family; she qualifies for
   tracheostomy and possibly to pleurodesis. However, it would depend in
   what her wishes are. Patient more oriented this AM.  Family meeting
   today..
   -          PS trial this morning and consider extubation.
   .
   # Agitation: Patient receiving haldol and seroquel per psych recs. Also
   on midaz and fentaynl gtt.
   .
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Then, PTX recurred after chest tube was taken out. Now
   resolved on CXR, no leaking on the chest tube nor drainage in the last
   24 hours. However, she may be candidate for pleurodesis at this point.
   - f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] regarding pleurodesis
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. Will not pursue NG tube at this
   point.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  HCT this AM 21.6 from 22.3.  Stable over
   last couple of days. Initially concern for GI bleed given positive
   guaiacs but apparently this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t
   irritation at Jtube site. Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   -          may need to rethink her pain medication as this is patients
   main complaint, will redoes her PO medications
   -          if not reintubated on sedation, continue fentanyl patch.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, who underwent an esophagectomy and is now experiencing severe gastroparesis and acute respiratory failure. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 81/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 50% FiO2. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 13, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and an inspiratory flow of 60 L/min.

The patient has been on meropenem for 4 days and is also receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions. She has had multiple episodes of tension pneumothorax requiring emergent needle decompression and placement of a chest tube. The most recent episode has resolved, but the patient may be a candidate for pleurodesis.

The patient is also experiencing agitation, receiving haloperidol and quetiapine per psychiatric recommendations. She has a history of multifocal atrial tachycardia, currently in the 70s, which has improved with metoprolol. She is also on digoxin for heart failure.

The patient has severe gastropares"

   times so far for multiple reasons. Patient with copious secretions,
   from GI tract and now very sedated.
   -          f/u cultures
   -          Continue meropenem (Day [**4-7**])
   -          Discuss goals of care with family; she qualifies for
   tracheostomy and possibly to pleurodesis. However, it would depend in
   what her wishes are. Patient more oriented this AM.  Family meeting
   today..
   -          PS trial this morning and consider extubation.
   .
   # Agitation: Patient receiving haldol and seroquel per psych recs. Also
   on midaz and fentaynl gtt.
   .
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Then, PTX recurred after chest tube was taken out. Now
   resolved on CXR, no leaking on the chest tube nor drainage in the last
   24 hours. However, she may be candidate for pleurodesis at this point.
   - f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] regarding pleurodesis
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. Will not pursue NG tube at this
   point.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  HCT this AM 21.6 from 22.3.  Stable over
   last couple of days. Initially concern for GI bleed given positive
   guaiacs but apparently this is a baseline issue, potentially d/t
   irritation at Jtube site. Will continue to monitor on labs.
   - serial hematocrits
   - transfusion goal < 21
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty. Patient put back on her home regimen.
   -          may need to rethink her pain medication as this is patients
   main complaint, will redoes her PO medications
   -          if not reintubated on sedation, continue fentanyl patch.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 66-year-old female with COPD, esophageal perforation, and severe gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and required intubation.
- The patient has a history of multiple complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), iatrogenic pleural effusion (PTX), and infection with ESBL Klebsiella.
- She has been on meropenem for three days and has had multiple reintubations due to copious secretions and sedation.
- The patient also has agitation, which is being managed with haloperidol and quetiapine.
- She experienced a tension pneumothorax after a central line placement, requiring needle decompression and chest tube insertion. The PTX resolved, but she may be a candidate for pleurodesis.
- The patient has multifocal atrial tachycardia, which has improved with metoprolol.
- She has gastroparesis, nausea, and malnutrition, but her nutrition is being managed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since she is unable to take oral feeds.
- The patient has chronic blood loss anemia, which is stable, and her hemoglobin levels are being monitored.
- She has severe COPD exacerbation contributing to her respiratory failure, and her oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, who was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and intubation. She has had multiple complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, tension pneumothorax, severe gastroparesis, and chronic blood loss anemia. The patient has been unresponsive to extubation attempts and requires tracheostomy, which is planned for Wednesday. She also requires pleurodesis due to recurrent pneumothorax. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 128/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 43900/mm3 and elevated lactate levels at 9.0 mmol/L. The patient continues to receive mechanical ventilation with PSV mode, set at 50% FiO2 and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and recent aspiration pneumonia contribute to her ongoing respiratory failure. The patient is currently on day 5 of meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella infection. She has failed extubation three times and has a negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -17 cmH2"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient with severe COPD and possible
   aspiration PNA with recent left side iatrogenic PTX. Currently on day 5
   of meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella.  She has failed extuabtion x3, and
   given her instrinsic lung disease and recent aspiration pneumonia, will
   be very difficult to succesfuly extubate in the short-term, especially
   with NIF of -17. Patient has been tolerating PS [**9-7**], 50% well since
   yesterday morning.
   - Appreciate IP recs. Tentative plan for tracheostomy on Wednesday, NPO
   at midnight with TF held.  IP to discuss with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] regarding open
   versus percutaneous trach.
   - Discussed with CT surgery yesterday. Patient will likely require
   pleurodesis, which can be done in conjunction with trach either by OP
   or CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] depending on open versus percuatenous approach.
   - Family meeting planned for 3 pm today.
   - Continues to be on PS [**9-7**], 50%.  Vt 350-400, RR ~[**11-14**]. Continue PS
   for now with PEEP of 8, as patient appears to be tolerating well.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with hypotension (MAP 50s) overnight that was
   fluid responsive.  Remains afebrile without a leukocytosis.
   - IVF bolus as necessary for MAP<60.
   .
   # Agitation: Patient receiving haldol and seroquel per psych recs. Also
   on midaz and fentaynl gtt.
   - Titrate down on midazolam and fentaynl gtt as possible.
   .
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Patient has had recurrent pneumonthorax after chest tube
   removal, and thus may be a candidate for sclerotherapy.
   - f/u with CT surgery
   .
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - Consider systemic steroids if patient will not undergo sclerotherapy
   per CT surgery.
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   .
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.
   - continue digoxin
   - continue metoprolol, increase if BP tolerates
   .
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Patient has been shown to be
   absorbing via TF thus will continue with adjustments per nutrition
   recommendations. Follow residuals. Will not pursue NG tube at this
   point.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  HCT this AM 22.9 from 24.1.  Stable over
   last couple of days. Concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but
   this may be a chronic issue.
   - Trend hematocrit with transfusion threshold hct< 21
   .
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated. She also has a history of esophageal perforation following esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax, agitation, hypotension, and multifocal atrial tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's intrinsic lung disease and recent aspiration pneumonia make it difficult to successfully extubate her in the short-term. This increases the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation and associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Tension pneumothorax: The patient has recurrent pneumothorax after chest tube removal, which may require sclerotherapy. If not managed properly, there is a risk of persistent air leak, recurrent pneumothorax, and development of pleural fibrosis.

3. Agitation: The patient is receiving antipsychotic medications to manage agitation. If not properly controlled, agitation can increase the risk of self-extubation, patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, and staff injury.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires close monitoring and fluid management. Inadequate response to fluid resuscitation may necess"

   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Patient has had recurrent pneumonthorax after chest tube
   removal, and thus may be a candidate for sclerotherapy.
   - f/u with CT surgery

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with severe COPD, esophageal perforation post esophagectomy, and severe gastroparesis. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The patient has failed extubation three times and has intrinsic lung disease with recent aspiration pneumonia. She is on day 5 of meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, agitation, tension pneumothorax, COPD exacerbation, multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition, chronic blood loss anemia, chronic back pain/compression fractures, and needs further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and recent aspiration pneumonia make her prone to recurrent episodes of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Tension Pneumothorax: The patient has had recurrent pneumothorax after chest tube removal. She may require pleurodesis to prevent further occurrences.

4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's severe emphysema contributes to her respiratory failure. Nebulizers"

   moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions have increased. ET tube tip at the upper margin of the

   should be advanced at least 2 cm but precise localization is difficult
   because
   of kyphotic positioning. Right pleural tube has short intrathoracic
   excursion and may have backed out since the prior study. Gastric tube
   ends in the stomach below the elevated left hemidiaphragm. Right
   jugular line probably ends in the SVC. No pneumothorax. Heart size top
   normal.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation with multiple failed
   extubations.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient with severe COPD and possible
   aspiration PNA with recent left-sided iatrogenic PTX. Currently on day
   6 of meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella.  She has failed extubation x3, and
   given her intrinsic lung disease and recent aspiration pneumonia, will
   be very difficult to succesfuly extubate in the short-term, especially
   with NIF of -17. Following family meeting yesterday, decision made to
   not proceed with trach and to plan for extubation today.  Patient also
   made DNR with plan to transition to CMO.
   - Extubate this AM
   - Morphine gtt
   - Discontinue meropenem
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient received additional 500 cc bolus yesterday in
   addition to 1u PRBCs.  Hypotension likely secondary to intravascular
   volume depletion in setting of hypoalbuminemia and decreased oncotic
   pressure.
   .
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Patient has had recurrent pneumonthorax after chest tube.
   .
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing for comfort
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   .
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.  Patient with subtherapeutic digoxin level yesterday,
   received additional 0.125 mg.
   - Hold digoxin and metoprolol
   .
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Difficulty advancing TF rate, and
   patient with hypoalbuminemia.  Given intravascular volume depletion as
   above, TPN started
   - Hold TPN, PPI, ca/vit d.
   .
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  HCT this AM 27.6.
   .
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, hold TPN
   .
   # PPx: Hold heparin and ppi
   .
   # Code: DNR, transition to CMO following extubation.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophageal perforation post esophagectomy, severe gastroparesis, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has been transferred to the ICU for further management. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax, COPD exacerbation, multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis, chronic blood loss anemia, chronic back pain with compression fractures, and poor nutritional status.

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate in the 60s, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 427 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

The plan for the patient includes extubation in the morning, discontinuation of meropenem, and transitioning to comfort measures only (CMO) due to the patient's decision to forgo aggressive treatment. Other plans include providing supportive care for COPD exacerbation, managing tension pneumothorax, monitoring and treating multifocal atrial tachycardia"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation with multiple failed
   extubations.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient with severe COPD and possible
   aspiration PNA with recent left-sided iatrogenic PTX. Currently on day
   6 of meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella.  She has failed extubation x3, and
   given her instrinsic lung disease and recent aspiration pneumonia, will
   be very difficult to succesfuly extubate in the short-term, especially
   with NIF of -17. Following family meeting yesterday, decision made to
   not proceed with trach and to plan for extubation today.  Patient also
   made DNR.
   - Extubate this AM with morphine prn if patient has discomfort
   - Continue meropenem for now (day 6)
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient received additional 500 cc bolus yesterday in
   addition to 1u PRBCs.  Hypotension likely secondary to intravascular
   volume depletion in setting of hypoalbuminemia and decreased oncotic
   pressure.
   - Monitor BP and fluid bolus as necessary
   .
   # Agitation: Patient receiving haldol and seroquel per psych recs. Also
   on midaz and fentaynl gtt.
   - Titrate down on midazolam and fentaynl gtt as possible.
   .
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Patient has had recurrent pneumonthorax after chest tube.
   .
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   .
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.  Patient with subtherapeutic digoxin level yesterday,
   received additional 0.125 mg.
   - continue digoxin and metoprolol
   .
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Difficulty advancing TF rate, and
   patient with hypoalbuminemia.  Given intravascular volume depletion as
   above, TPN started
   - Continue TPN
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - continue calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  HCT this AM 22.9 from 24.1.  Stable over
   last couple of days. Concern for GI bleed given positive guaiacs but
   this may be a chronic issue.
   - Trend hematocrit

   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, who underwent an esophagectomy and is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated multiple times, with failed extubations, and has a recent left-sided iatrogenic pneumothorax. She also has severe gastroparesis, hypoalbuminemia, and a chronic blood loss anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's intrinsic lung disease and recent aspiration pneumonia make it difficult to successfully extubate her in the short-term.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion in the setting of hypoalbuminemia and decreased oncotic pressure.
3. Tension pneumothorax: The patient has had recurrent pneumothorax after chest tube placement.
4. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 70s, which is improved with metoprolol.
5. Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition: The patient has difficulty advancing TF rate and hypoalbuminemia, indicating potential malnutrition.
6. Chronic blood loss anemia: The patient's HCT has decreased from 24.1 to 22.9, indicating ongoing blood loss.
7. Chronic back pain/compression fractures"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal perforation s/p
   esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   acute respiratory failure requiring intubation with multiple failed
   extubations.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient with severe COPD and possible
   aspiration PNA with recent left-sided iatrogenic PTX. Currently on day
   6 of meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella.  She has failed extubation x3, and
   given her intrinsic lung disease and recent aspiration pneumonia, will
   be very difficult to succesfuly extubate in the short-term, especially
   with NIF of -17. Following family meeting yesterday, decision made to
   not proceed with trach and to plan for extubation today.  Patient also
   made DNR with plan to transition to CMO.
   - Extubate this AM
   - Morphine gtt
   - Discontinue meropenem
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient received additional 500 cc bolus yesterday in
   addition to 1u PRBCs.  Hypotension likely secondary to intravascular
   volume depletion in setting of hypoalbuminemia and decreased oncotic
   pressure.
   .
   # Tension Pneumothorax:  Patient with PTX after right subclavian line
   placement that required emergent needle decompression and posterior
   chest tube. Patient has had recurrent pneumonthorax after chest tube.
   .
   # COPD: Severe emphysema at baseline which is significant contributor
   of her respiratory failure.
   - continue nebulizers standing for comfort
   - titrate oxygen for sats >88-94%
   .
   # Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Currently her rate is in the 70s,
   improved with metoprolol. Increased dose yesterday since she was
   tachycardic.  Patient with subtherapeutic digoxin level yesterday,
   received additional 0.125 mg.
   - Hold digoxin and metoprolol
   .
   # Gastroparesis/nausea/malnutrition:  Difficulty advancing TF rate, and
   patient with hypoalbuminemia.  Given intravascular volume depletion as
   above, TPN started
   - Hold TPN, PPI, ca/vit d.
   .
   # Chronic Blood Loss Anemia:  HCT this AM 27.6.
   .
   # Chronic Back Pain/Compression Fractures:  Patient with multiple
   thoracic compression fractures.  Per orthopedics no role for
   kyphoplasty.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, hold TPN

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophageal perforation, and severe gastroparesis who was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She required intubation and has had multiple failed extubations. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax, COPD exacerbation, multifocal atrial tachycardia, gastroparesis, chronic blood loss anemia, chronic back pain with compression fractures, and fecal incontinence. The patient's family has made the decision to not proceed with tracheostomy and plans for extubation today. The patient also has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order with plans to transition to comfort measures only (CMO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and recent aspiration pneumonia make her at high risk for continued respiratory failure post-extubation.
2. Tension pneumothorax: The patient has experienced recurrent pneumothoraces, which can be life-threatening if not managed appropriately.
3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's severe emphysema puts her at risk for further exacerbations, leading to worsening respiratory failure.
4. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia needs to be carefully monitored and managed to prevent complications associated with increased heart rate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, who underwent an esophagectomy and developed severe gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and required intubation. After multiple failed extubations, she was made comfort measures only (CMO) and extubated yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given the patient's severe COPD and possible aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of continued respiratory compromise leading to hypoxia.
2. Iatrogenic pneumothorax: The patient has a history of left-sided iatrogenic pneumothorax, which can recur and cause respiratory distress.
3. Infection: The patient may be at risk for developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections, due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVTs, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and immobilization can predispose her to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
6. Dysglycemia: Maintaining glycemic control can be challenging in critically ill patients, and the patient may be at risk of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, who has undergone an esophagectomy and is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She was intubated due to multiple failed extubations but was extubated yesterday and placed on comfort measures only (CMO) after a family meeting. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/61 mmHg to 83/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 50%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and recent respiratory failure indicate a potential risk for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The presence of an arterial line and multi-lumen line increases the risk of bloodstream infections. Additionally, the patient's immunocompromised state due to surgery and hospitalization may predispose them to infections.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVTs.
4. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's severe gastroparesis and stress from the medical condition increase the risk of stress ulcer bleeding.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, esophageal perforation, and severe gastroparesis. She was previously admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and required intubation with multiple failed extubations. After a family meeting two days ago, it was decided to extubate the patient and provide comfort measures only (CMO). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/61 mmHg to 83/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 50%. The patient is receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and morphine infusions for sedation and pain management. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,638 mL and output of 2,110 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -472 mL. The patient is also receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set at a tidal volume of 391 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 17 cmH2O, and a spontaneous respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.
