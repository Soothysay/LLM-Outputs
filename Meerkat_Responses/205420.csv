","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease who was found unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including possible pulmonary infection, hypotension, altered mental status, cardiac issues, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and hypercapnea suggests a potential respiratory problem. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, such as pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism.

2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension indicates a possible septic shock or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, and cardiac function is necessary.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness and lethargy could be related to underlying infection, narcotics overdose, arrhythmia, or symptomatic bradycardia. It is essential to assess and manage these possibilities appropriately.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's history of severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiac complications. Ischemia, arrhythmias, and heart failure should be considered, and appropriate cardiac monitoring and treatment should be initiated.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine level suggests acute renal failure. Evaluation"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease who was found unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension. She has been intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's initial presentation includes elevated CO2 levels, respiratory acidosis, and unclear infection status. She is suspected to have a possible pulmonary source of infection, possibly pneumonia or lower lobe lung infiltrate. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) have been initiated to cover gram-negative bacteria and pseudomonal coverage, as well as treat possible sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is being treated for possible pulmonary source of infection, including pneumonia or lower lobe lung infiltrate.
2. Hypotension: The patient is suspected to have septic shock or cardiogenic shock. Fluid resuscitation with normal saline (NS) and consideration of dopamine as a pressor is being planned. Antibiotics for possible sepsis have been started.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness is likely related to underlying infection, possible pulmonary source, narcotics overdose, arrhythmia, or symptomatic bradycardia. Further evaluation is needed.
4. Non-gap Acidosis: The patient likely has aggressive volume resuscitation with NS.
5. UTI: The patient may have a urinary tract infection contributing to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old woman with severe AS and CAD who presents with hypoxemic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She appears to have a LLL
   infiltrate (slightly worse since admission with hydration) and it
   sounds like she had some respiratory symptoms over the last few days.
   She is certainly at risk for CHF as well, and her extremities are cool,
   so this may be part of the picture as well. Urosepsis clearly on the
   differential.
   1. Respiratory failure - will cover for nosocomial pneumonia with
   cefepime/vanco. Started on LVF but urine Leg negative so will d/c. Swab
   for flu pending.  Blood/sputum cultures to follow up on.  Will switch
   her over to PSV, tolerating [**12-28**] but having periods of apnea.
   Hypercapnia may be related to oxycontin.
   2. Hypotension, question of sepsis - urosepsis vs LLL pneumonia,
   unclear what this was related to, but suspect sepsis. Alternatively dry
   in setting of severe AS. Required fluids for hypotension. Continue to
   hydrate with PRN LR boluses. No need for pressors at this time.  Will
   challenge with volume if she drops her pressure again.  Would use
   dopamine if she remains hypotensive with bradycardia.  Will repeat ECHO
   in the am.  Hold atenolol with bradycardia. Hx of RA, question of
   previous steroids. Would consider adrenal insufficiency.
   3. Bradycardia - she is remarkably bradycardic.  Enzymes (trop)
   trending down but doubt cardiogenic failure with good central sat,
   though obviously has bad AS.
   4. CAD - reportedly worked up for CABG + AVR but felt to be poor
   surgical candidate.
   5. Thyroid disease - will check TSH (despite critical illness) with
   hypothermia.
   6. RA
 hold oxycontin for now, will use fentanyl as needed.
   7. Mental status - found unresponsive. CT head to be done today.
   8. Acute renal failure - improving, likely prerenal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and was intubated. She had been recently treated for a respiratory infection with Biaxin prior to admission. The patient required transient pressor support during intubation and was started on cefepime and vancomycin for suspected nosocomial pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show bradycardia with a heart rate of 54 bpm and hypotension with a blood pressure of 86/40 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 177 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yr old female hx of severe aortic stenosis, CAD presenting
   unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension.
   .
   #respiratory distress: Found unresponsive vs lethargic at NS, with O2
   sat to reported 59%. Intubation in the setting of elevated C02 to 61.
   respiratory acidosis. Unclear setting of infection, pneumonia.?LLL
   infiltrate, fever to 101, URI symptoms prior. Possible hypercapnea in
   the setting of oversedation with narcotics. Failure in the setting of
   AS also possible.
   -Treat possible pulm source with vanc given in nursing home. Cefepime
   to cover broader gram negative and pseudomonal coverage. Discussed with
   attg will maintain on levo for atypicals. reported sensitivity to
   penicillin, administered cefepime in ED w/o complication. Will clarify.
   -blood cx, sputum cx
   -Influenza, urine legionella
   -empiric tamiflu until DFA returns
   -wean to PS and hopeful extubation tomorrow
   -hold home lasix, but will check BNP, CVP assess fluid status
   .
   #Hypotension: Concern for septic shock vs cardiogenic shock. SV02
   initial greater than 70, cool extremities, cardiac hx. Source of
   infection includes lung, and less likely though still very plausible in
   elderly female with cystitis altered mental status is urosepsis
   -check SVO2
   -IV fluids as pre load dependent. Of course concern given severe AS and
   pulm edema, though appears euvolemic to dry on exam with elevated
   creatinine.
   -Monitor CVP goal [**9-4**]
   -Antibiotics for presumed sepsis as above
   -trend CE
   -TTE in AM
   .
   #altered mental status: Found unresponsive with hypercapnea. consider
   related to underlying infection, possible pulmonary source. Also
   consider narcotics overdose with lethargy and C02 retention. Arrythmia,
   symptomatic bradycardia also should be considered. Difficult to assess
   currently as pt intubated.
   -medaz/fentanyl bolus as needed for pain/sedation
   -hold oxycontin
   -on ventilator
   -treat infection
   -check TSH
   -consider CT head though no known head trauma, no clear evidence of
   bleed.
   .
   #cardiac:
   ##ischemia- hx of CAD, angina in the past. Trop leak to 0.26. Consider
   in the setting or worsening renal function and stress from hypotension,
   ?sepsis.
   -trend CE
   -monitor on tele
   -EKG in AM
   -TTE in AM
   -ASA
   ##Pump:[**2111**] EF 65%. Pt with severe AS. Unclear whether diastolic
   dysfunction associated. Consider possible pulmonary edema in the
   setting of AS.
   -Hold diuresis, as consider preload dependent and hypotension leading
   to decreased preload and decreased cardiac output.
   -IV fluids to maintain MAP>65. Dopamine as needed to maintain MAP.
   -check BNP
   ##Rhythm: sinus bradycardia. Consider brady in the setting of atenolol
   at home with renal failure. Likely elderly with conduction disease
   -Hold BB
   -monitor on tele
   -atropine as needed
   -Will use dopamine for pressor if needed as will increase HR and help
   with bradycardia
   -covering PCP to fax previous DC summary, TTE report
   .
   #Thyroid disease: Unclear with surgery in the past
   -Check TSH in the setting of temp, and altered mental status
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently hypotensive.
   -Hold BB
   -Hold imdur
   .
   #RA: hold narcotics in setting of unresponsive episode.
   -fent as needed
   .
   #acute renal failure: Unclear baseline. Hx of CRI ~1.1-1.5 in the past.
   Currently 1.5. Consider pre renal from volume depletion.
   -gentle hydration
   -send urine for casts, eos
   -urine osms of does not respond in AM

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease who was found unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension. She has been intubated due to elevated CO2 levels and respiratory acidosis. The possible causes of respiratory distress include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), or oversedation with narcotics. The patient also has altered mental status, which could be due to an underlying infection, pulmonary source, narcotics overdose, arrhythmia, or symptomatic bradycardia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 132/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her CVP is 6 mmHg, CO is 8 L/min, and SvO2 is 80%. The patient is on minimal vent settings and is planned to be extubated in the morning.

The patient has a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 90 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and troponin T of 0.20 ng/mL. The patient's blood cultures are yellow and show no growth. The imaging reveals a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and some prominence of the bronchovascular"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She was found unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension, and subsequently intubated due to elevated CO2 levels and respiratory acidosis. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory distress, hypotension, altered mental status, potential pulmonary infection, cardiac issues related to ischemia and severe aortic stenosis, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and hypercapnea indicate a potential for worsening respiratory failure. Extubation may pose risks if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.

2. Infection: The presence of fever, URI symptoms prior to admission, and focal area of consolidation within the mid lung zone on chest X-ray suggest a possible pulmonary infection. Blood and sputum cultures have been ordered to identify the causative organism.

3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and severe aortic stenosis puts her at risk for cardiac ischemia and potential heart failure. Monitoring for signs of worsening chest pain, dyspnea, or changes in vital signs is essential.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline renal function indicates acute renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output and laboratory values is crucial to assess kidney function and manage fluid balance.

5. Septic Shock: Given"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate, which has worsened since admission with hydration. The patient also shows signs of possible congestive heart failure (CHF) and is at risk for urosepsis, as indicated by a positive urine culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to the LLL infiltrate. She will be covered for nosocomial pneumonia with cefepime/vancomycin. LVF (left ventricular failure) was initially started but has been discontinued since the urine Legs are negative. Swab for flu is pending, and blood/sputum cultures will follow up on the respiratory symptoms.

2. Hypotension and sepsis: The patient's hypotension could be related to urosepsis or LLL pneumonia. It is unclear which condition is more likely, but sepsis is suspected and is now improving. The patient has been volume resuscitated, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is pending to evaluate for potential cardiac dysfunction.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia has improved, and cardiac enzymes (tropon"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and CAD who presented unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension. She had respiratory distress and was intubated due to elevated CO2 levels. There is uncertainty regarding the setting of infection, with possible pneumonia or lower lobe lung infiltrate. Sputum culture grew out MRSA. The patient's hypotension is concerning for septic shock or cardiogenic shock, with a possible source of infection in the lung. Altered mental status is present and could be related to underlying infection or narcotics overdose. Other considerations include arrhythmia or symptomatic bradycardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial presentation of unresponsiveness and hypercapnea indicates respiratory distress. The intubation was performed due to elevated CO2 levels and respiratory acidosis. This suggests the possibility of respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Infection: The presence of MRSA in the sputum culture indicates a potential bacterial infection. The source of infection could be pneumonia or a lower lobe lung infiltrate. It is essential to treat the infection aggressively to prevent further complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension suggests a possible septic shock or cardiogenic shock. The source of infection seems to be in the lung, but other sources like cystitis should also be considered, especially in elderly patients"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors.

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient was found unresponsive with an oxygen saturation level of 59% and treated with intubation due to elevated CO2 levels and respiratory acidosis. This could be attributed to possible pulmonary infection or pneumonia, as well as hypercapnea in the setting of oversedation with narcotics. Failure in the setting of AS is also possible.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate septic shock or cardiogenic shock. The initial stroke volume (SV02) was greater than 70, suggesting cardiogenic shock due to the patient's cardiac history. The source of infection appears to be the lung, although urinary tract infection (UTI) cannot be ruled out.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness with hypercapnea raises concerns about an underlying infection, possibly of pulmonary origin. Narcotics overdose should also be considered, along with arrhythmia and symptomatic bradycardia.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of CAD and previous episodes of angina. Tropin T levels are elevated, indicating myocardial injury. Worsening renal function and stress from hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old woman with severe AS and CAD who presents with hypoxemic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure.   LLL infiltrate (slightly worse
   since admission with hydration) and it sounds like she had some
   respiratory symptoms over the last few days.  She is certainly at risk
   for CHF as well, and her extremities are [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this may be part of
   the picture as well. Urosepsis clearly on the differential and now with
   positive urine culture.
   1. Respiratory failure / ID issues - extubated without complication.
   Covered for nosocomial pneumonia with cefepime/vanco. Started on LVF
   but urine Leg negative so will d/c. Sputum positive for MRSA, unclear
   if colonized or cause of pna.  Hypercapnia may have been related to
   oxycontin. Will complete 7 d course of gram neg coverage and vanco
   2. Hypotension - resolved, question of sepsis - likely LLL pneumonia.
   Alternatively was dry in setting of severe AS, now volume resuscitated.
   TTE repeated. Hx of RA, question of previous steroids. Would consider
   adrenal insufficiency.
   3. Bradycardia - Improved, enzymes (trop) trending down, no evidence
   for ACS.
   4. CAD - reportedly worked up for CABG + AVR but felt to be poor
   surgical candidate. Mrs [**Known lastname 1519**] confirms that she refused surgery and
   does not wish to change this.
   5. RA
 oxycontin held, will restart small dose, looks comfortable
   6. Mental status - alert, responds to commands
   7. Acute renal failure - improving, likely prerenal

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate, which has worsened since admission. She also has absent peripheral pulses, suggesting possible peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
- The patient was initially on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated without complications.
- She has positive sputum culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a urine culture showing contamination.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable, and there is no evidence of sepsis or acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is on steroids.
- The patient has refused surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR).
- Her mental status is alert and responsive to commands.
- The patient has acute renal failure but is improving, likely due to pre-renal causes.
- She is stable for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, an 80-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis and CAD, was found unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension.
- Initial concerns included respiratory distress, possible infection (pneumonia or urinary tract infection), and hypercapnea due to oversedation with narcotics.
- The patient had evidence of fluid overload, leading to the restart of home lasix.
- Hypotension was initially treated as septic shock but could also be cardiogenic shock due to the patient's cardiac history.
- The source of infection was believed to be the lung, but urosepsis was also considered.
- Altered mental status was attributed to hypercapnea, possible pulmonary source, narcotics overdose, or arrhythmia.
- The patient's cardiac history included CAD and angina, and there was a concern for ischemia due to worsening renal function and stress from hypotension.
- The patient's ejection fraction was 65%, and she had severe aortic stenosis.
- Thyroid disease was unclear but normal TSH levels were noted.
- Hypertension was initially present but then became hypertensive, possibly due to elevated volume from aggressive fluid resuscitation.
- The patient's pain management involved restarting oxycontin at a lower dose since she presented with altered mental status but did not complain of pain.
- Acute renal failure resolved.
- The patient was on various medications for prophylaxis, including DVT prevention"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented unresponsive with hypercapnea and hypotension. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress, and there were concerns about septic shock versus cardiogenic shock. The source of infection was suspected to be the lungs, but it could also be cystitis. The patient had altered mental status, possibly related to an underlying infection or narcotics overdose. Bradycardia was also considered. The patient's cardiac history included a previous episode of angina, and there were concerns about ischemia in the setting of worsening renal function and stress from hypotension. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 65%, but severe aortic stenosis was present. The patient's thyroid status was unclear with past surgeries, and hypertension was initially hypotensive but then became hypertensive. The patient was restarted on oxycontin at home dose and restarted on lasix due to evidence of fluid overload. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved. The patient is currently in the ICU and will be transferred to a rehab or long-term care facility. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress and failure due to hypercapnea and possible pneumonia.
2. Septic shock due to MRSA infection, which may have originated from the lungs or urinary tract.
3. Cardiogenic shock due to severe a"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old woman with severe AS and CAD who presents with hypoxemic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure.   LLL infiltrate (slightly worse
   since admission with hydration) and it sounds like she had some
   respiratory symptoms over the last few days.  She is certainly at risk
   for CHF as well, and her extremities are [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this may be part of
   the picture as well.
    1. Respiratory failure / ID issues - extubated without complication.
   Covered for nosocomial pneumonia with cefepime/vanco, now on
   vanco/ceft. Sputum positive for MRSA, unclear if colonized or cause of
   pna.  Hypercapnia may have been related to oxycontin. Will complete 7 d
   course of vanco/Ceph
    2. Hypotension - resolved, question of sepsis - likely LLL pneumonia.
   Alternatively was dry in setting of severe AS, now volume resuscitated.
   TTE repeated. Hx of RA, question of previous steroids.
    3. Bradycardia - Improved, enzymes (trop) trending down, no evidence
   for ACS.
   4. CAD - reportedly worked up for CABG + AVR but felt to be poor
   surgical candidate. Mrs [**Known lastname 1519**] confirms that she refused surgery and
   does not wish to change this.
   5. RA
 oxycontin held, will restart small dose, looks comfortable
   6. Acute renal failure - improved, likely was prerenal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate and is at risk for congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's extremities are cool and clammy, which may be related to her condition as well.

The patient has been treated for respiratory failure and infection issues by being extubated without complication. She was covered for nosocomial pneumonia with cefepime/vancomycin, now on vancomycin/ceftriaxone. Her sputum is positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), although it is unclear if she is colonized or if MRSA is the cause of pneumonia. She will complete a 7-day course of vancomycin/ceftriaxone.

The patient also had hypotension, which has resolved, but there is still a question of sepsis, likely due to LLL pneumonia. Another possibility is that the hypotension was caused by severe AS, and the patient has been volume resuscitated. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has been repeated. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and there is a question of previous steroid use.
