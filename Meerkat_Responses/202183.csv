   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 year-old female with multiple medical problems including
   HTN, PVD, chronic pain on oxycodone, OSA, ? Crohn
s disease and on
   multiple sedating meds who presented with altered mental status and
   fever after being found down by her son.
    #. Altered mental status:  This was the initial etiology of the
   patient
s need for intubation.  Differential is broad but given
   significant agitation component and lack of focality some suggestion
   this is most likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy or delirium.  No
   nuchal rigidity, photophobia, or focal neural deficits.  Etiology
   currently unclear with pneumosepsis or other infection vs encephalitis
   vs seizure activity and post-ictal state all being possibilities.  ICU
   delirium in the context of chronic microvascular changes is also a
   concern.   Given patient was hypoxic slightly after being found
   prolonged hypoxia and anoxic brain injury is also on the differential.
   - hold sedatives
   -Continue ID w/u and follow cultures
   - Consider LP to r/o encephalitis
   - Head CT appears stable, follow final read and consider MRI PRN
   -Consider neuro consult if persistent MS changes after hypotension and
   other issues are stabilized
   -F/U TSH, B12, RPR
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Liklely respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation at baseline secondary to COPD.  Given pneumonia
   potential for tiring in already suboptimal lung now burdened with
   infiltrate.
   - continue assist control on ventilator
   - broad spectrum antibx with vanco/cipro/flagyl because of penicillin
   allergy
   - consider chest CTA
   - keep PCO2 at baseline of ~50.
   #Hypotension: The patient has developed somewhat fluid responsive
   relative hypotension overnight.  Etiology is unclear and possible
   etiologies would consider cardiogenic shock vs septic shock vs SIRS vs
   neurogenic shock.  Cardiogenic shock considered less likely due to no
   signs of volume overload.  Other etiologies both have some evidence to
   support.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx and f/u cx
   -Neuro work-up as above
   #EKG changes: Persistent T-wave inversions if V1-V6 and low voltage in
   limb leads with normal voltage in precordials is a strange pattern.
   Not associated particularly with  MI and enzymes falling but given
   association with hypotension this is concerning.
   -Cardiology consult.
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis:  Normal pancreatic enzymes and benign CT suggest
   abdominal etiology less likely.  Major differential now is pneumonia vs
   meningitis vs spontaneous bacteremia.
   - pan culture if spikes
   - vanc/levo/flagyl
   - consider cefepime/gent if clinically worsens
   #. Pancreatitis:  Minimal elevations in amylase and lipase here despite
   reported very high level at OSH.  This does not seem to be the etiology
   of the patient
s symptoms.
   #. Crohns Disease:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**]; per OMR  notes, this
   diagnosis is mainly symptom based with little objective evidence.  EGD
   and colonoscopy normal in 1/[**2150**].  PO budesonide minimally absorbed but
   as she is on this chronically and adrenal insufficiency is on the
   differential for hypotension we will check for adrenal insufficiencty.
   -Random serum cortisol.
   #. Chronic Pain:  On fentanyl for sedation, holding other opiates.
   #. HTN: holding lisinopril and atenolol in setting of possible acute
   infection
   #. Cushings syndrome:  Secondary to chronic prednisone.  Will convert
   to methylprednisolone.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: stable.
   - continue atorvostatin
   #. Obstructive sleep apnea:  Will clarify whether patient uses BiPap at
   home.
   #. Depression/anxiety:  will hold home meds while evaluating mental
   status but consider d/c'ing sucraflate given negative EGD recently, as
   may be decreasing absorption of other medications.
   #. COPD:  On baseline home O2 of 3L and has a long smoking history.
   Respiratory failure management as above.
   #. Cor pulmonale:  Has [**3-18**]+ TR at baseline.  Continue to follow.
   #. PVD s/p bilateral CIA stenting in [**6-/2149**]:  continue to follow
   #. ?Seizure disorder:  evaulated in [**1-/2150**]: EEG showing some fcal
   slowing in the left anterior temporal area, but felt to be
   non-specific, holding on seizure meds for now.
   FEN:  tube feed reccs in a.m., IVF prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain on oxycodone, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible Crohn's disease. She presented with altered mental status and fever after being found down by her son. The patient has been intubated due to agitation and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a penicillin allergy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's initial presentation with altered mental status requires further evaluation to determine the cause. Differential diagnosis includes toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, delirium, pneumonia, encephalitis, and post-ictal state. The patient's hypoxic episode after being found down raises the possibility of prolonged hypoxia and anoxic brain injury.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to COPD and pneumonia. Assist control ventilation is being continued, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered.
3. Hypotension: The patient has developed relative hypotension overnight. Possible etiologies include cardiogenic shock, septic shock, SIRS, and neurogenic shock. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and further evaluation is needed.
4. EKG changes: Persistent T-wave inversions in V1-V6 and low voltage in limb leads with normal precordial voltage are concerning. A cardiology consult is"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   55 year-old female with a PMH of HTN, PVD, seizure disorder, chronic
   pain on oxycodone, methadone, OSA who presents with fevers,
   pancreatitis, AMS, and respiratory failure.
    #. Altered mental status:  Cause for intubation.  Possible causes
   include toxic metabolic encephalopathy, delirium, medication effect (hx
   of seroquel, cyclobenzaprine, methadone, trazadone), seizure, CVA,
   infection (pancreatitis, aspiration pna, meningitis).  Prescribed
   seroquel on [**3-6**].  Tox screen positive for TCA (Duloxetine, cyclobenz,
   and seroquel can cause false positives), opiate (methadone hx), THC,
   and phenobarbital (in Donnatal), but negative for alcohol.  Hypercapnia
   in setting of COPD and aggravating factor also possible.  No nuchal
   rigidity, photophobia, or focal neural deficits.
   - hold sedatives
   - ID workup with pan cx
   - Empiric antibx
   - Consider LP
   - Head CT
   - TSH, B12, RPR, repeat tox screen
   - trend PCO2
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Liklely respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation at baseline secondary to COPD.  Differential for
   acute hypoxemic respiratory failure includes aspiration
   pna/pneumonitis, ARDS in setting of pancreatitis, pleural effusions,
   and PE.  RSBI 150 on presentation secondary to RR of 25 and tidal
   volumes ~200cc.  CXR shows ?right base atelectasis and scant
   infiltrates.
   - CXR in a.m.
   - continue assist control on ventilator
   - broad spectrum antibx with vanco/cipro/flagyl because of penicillin
   allergy
   - consider chest CTA
   - keep PCO2 at baseline of ~50.
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis:  Possible etiologies include pancreatitis,
   pneumonia, pneumonitis, meningitis, bacteremia.  Chronically on
   steroids so concern for abdominal abscess.
   - pan culture
   - CT abdomen/pelvis
   - vanc/levo/flagyl
   - consider cefepime/gent if clinically worsens
   #. Pancreatitis:  Elevated lipase secondary to possibly gallstone
   pancreatitis (alk phos elevated at 190), alcohol (though tox neg), or
   other less common etiologies such as hypertriglycerides, pancreatic
   carcinoma, medications, viral infections, abdominal trauma.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to r/o abscess
   - RUQ US
   - IVF
   - vanc/levo/flagyl, though evidence for antibx efficacy is limited
   #. Crohns Disease:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**]; per OMR  notes, this
   diagnosis is mainly symptom based with little objective evidence.
   Attempting to taper chronic steroids. EGD and colonoscopy normal in
   1/[**2150**].
   - will convert budesonide to equivalent methylprednisolone.
   #. Chronic Pain:  holding optiates.
   #. HTN: holding lisinopril and atenolol in setting of possible acute
   infection
   #. Cushings syndrome:  Secondary to chronic prednisone.  Will convert
   to methylprednisolone.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: stable.
   - continue atorvostatin
   #. Obstructive sleep apnea:  Will clarify whether patient uses BiPap at
   home.
   #. Depression/anxiety:  will hold home meds while evaluating mental
   status but consider d/c'ing sucraflate given negative EGD recently, as
   may be decreasing absorption of other medications.
   #. COPD:  On baseline home O2 of 3L and has a long smoking history.
   Respiratory failure management as above.
   #. Cor pulmonale:  Has [**3-18**]+ TR at baseline.  Continue to follow.
   #. PVD s/p bilateral CIA stenting in [**6-/2149**]:  continue to follow
   #. ?Seizure disorder:  evaulated in [**1-/2150**]: EEG showing some fcal
   slowing in the left anterior temporal area, but felt to be
   non-specific, holding on seizure meds for now.
   FEN:  tube feed reccs in a.m., IVF prn
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with hep sc
   -Bowel regimen with colace
   -Pain management with tylenol though ?allergy
    ACCESS: PIV's, CVL, will place A-line

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, seizure disorder, chronic pain on oxycodone, methadone, OSA, who presents with fevers, pancreatitis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. 

The patient has been intubated due to altered mental status. The possible causes of altered mental status include toxic metabolic encephalopathy, delirium, medication effect, seizure, CVA, infection (pancreatitis, aspiration pneumonia, meningitis). The tox screen is positive for TCA, opiate, THC, and phenobarbital but negative for alcohol. The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation at baseline secondary to COPD. The differential for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure includes aspiration pneumonia, ARDS in the setting of pancreatitis, pleural effusions, and PE. Chest X-ray shows right base atelectasis and scant infiltrates.

The patient also has fever and leukocytosis, which could be due to pancreatitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, meningitis, or bacteremia. The patient's pancreatitis is likely gallstone pancreatitis, but other etiologies such as alcohol, hypertriglycerides, pancreatic carcinoma, medications, viral infections, or abdominal trauma should be considered.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypoxemia, elevated lipase, epigastric abdominal pain, altered mental status, fever, and a white blood cell count. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. There are concerns about potential medical complications including pancreatitis, pneumonia vs. tracheobronchitis, hypotension with EKG changes, and altered mental status.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with severe COPD at baseline and home oxygen use. The patient has a fever, elevated WBC count, and significant sputum production with gram-staining organisms. The patient's mental status is altered, and there are concerns about a possible new cardiac event, as indicated by deep T-wave inversions on the EKG and low limb lead voltage.

Other potential complications include pneumonia vs. tracheobronchitis, which is being treated with empiric antibiotics and continued mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a history of COPD, for which MDIs and steroids will be continued.

In terms of hemodynamics, the patient is tachycardic but with stable blood pressure, and gentle fluid resuscitation has been provided. The patient's glycemic control, nutrition, and lines are being managed in the ICU.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care. The patient is critically ill."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   This is a 55 year-old female with multiple medical problems including
   HTN, PVD, chronic pain on oxycodone, OSA, ? Crohn
s disease and on
   multiple sedating meds who presented with altered mental status and
   fever after being found down by her son.
    #. Altered mental status:  This was the initial etiology of the
   patient
s need for intubation.  Differential is broad but given
   significant agitation component and lack of focality some suggestion
   this is most likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy or delirium.  No
   nuchal rigidity, photophobia, or focal neural deficits.  Etiology
   currently unclear with pneumosepsis or other infection vs encephalitis
   vs seizure activity and post-ictal state all being possibilities.  ICU
   delirium in the context of chronic microvascular changes is also a
   concern.   Given patient was hypoxic slightly after being found
   prolonged hypoxia and anoxic brain injury is also on the differential.
   - hold sedatives
   -Continue ID w/u and follow cultures
   - Consider LP to r/o encephalitis
   - Head CT appears stable, follow final read and consider MRI PRN
   -Consider neuro consult if persistent MS changes after hypotension and
   other issues are stabilized
   -F/U TSH, B12, RPR
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Liklely respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation at baseline secondary to COPD.  Given pneumonia
   potential for tiring in already suboptimal lung now burdened with
   infiltrate.
   - continue assist control on ventilator
   - broad spectrum antibx with vanco/cipro/flagyl because of penicillin
   allergy
   - consider chest CTA
   - keep PCO2 at baseline of ~50.
   #Hypotension: The patient has developed somewhat fluid responsive
   relative hypotension overnight.  Etiology is unclear and possible
   etiologies would consider cardiogenic shock vs septic shock vs SIRS vs
   neurogenic shock.  Cardiogenic shock considered less likely due to no
   signs of volume overload.  Other etiologies both have some evidence to
   support.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx and f/u cx
   -Neuro work-up as above
    #EKG changes: Persistent T-wave inversions if V1-V6 and low voltage in
   limb leads with normal voltage in precordials is a strange pattern.
   Not associated particularly with  MI and enzymes falling but given
   association with hypotension this is concerning.
   -Cardiology consult.
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis:  Normal pancreatic enzymes and benign CT suggest
   abdominal etiology less likely.  Major differential now is pneumonia vs
   meningitis vs spontaneous bacteremia.
   - pan culture if spikes
   - vanc/levo/flagyl
   - consider cefepime/gent if clinically worsens
   #. Pancreatitis:  Minimal elevations in amylase and lipase here despite
   reported very high level at OSH.  This does not seem to be the etiology
   of the patient
s symptoms.
   #. Crohns Disease:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**]; per OMR  notes, this
   diagnosis is mainly symptom based with little objective evidence.  EGD
   and colonoscopy normal in 1/[**2150**].  PO budesonide minimally absorbed but
   as she is on this chronically and adrenal insufficiency is on the
   differential for hypotension we will check for adrenal insufficiencty.
   -Random serum cortisol.
   #. Chronic Pain:  On fentanyl for sedation, holding other opiates.
   #. HTN: holding lisinopril and atenolol in setting of possible acute
   infection
   #. Cushings syndrome:  Secondary to chronic prednisone.  Will convert
   to methylprednisolone.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: stable.
   - continue atorvostatin
   #. Obstructive sleep apnea:  Will clarify whether patient uses BiPap at
   home.
   #. Depression/anxiety:  will hold home meds while evaluating mental
   status but consider d/c'ing sucraflate given negative EGD recently, as
   may be decreasing absorption of other medications.
   #. COPD:  On baseline home O2 of 3L and has a long smoking history.
   Respiratory failure management as above.
   #. Cor pulmonale:  Has [**3-18**]+ TR at baseline.  Continue to follow.
   #. PVD s/p bilateral CIA stenting in [**6-/2149**]:  continue to follow
   #. ?Seizure disorder:  evaulated in [**1-/2150**]: EEG showing some fcal
   slowing in the left anterior temporal area, but felt to be
   non-specific, holding on seizure meds for now.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain on oxycodone, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible Crohn's disease. She presented with altered mental status and fever after being found down by her son. 

The patient's current conditions include AMS (altered mental status), tachycardia, respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, and possible encephalitis. The differential diagnosis for AMS includes toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, delirium, hypoxic-anoxic brain injury, and chronic microvascular changes. The patient is also hypoxemic and has respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation due to COPD. There is a concern for cardiogenic shock, septic shock, SIRS, or neurogenic shock as the etiology of her hypotension. The EKG changes are nonspecific but concerning, and a cardiology consult is recommended. 

Fever and leukocytosis may indicate pneumonia, meningitis, or spontaneous bacteremia. The patient has minimal elevations in amylase and lipase, suggesting that pancreatitis is less likely. Crohn's disease is mainly symptom-based and there is little objective evidence. 

The patient is on fentanyl for sedation and her other opiates are being held. Her hypertension medications are also being held due to possible acute infection. She has a history of Cushing's syndrome secondary to chronic prednisone use, which will be"

   significant agitation component and lack of focality some suggestion
   this is most likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy or delirium.  No
   nuchal rigidity, photophobia, or focal neural deficits.  Etiology
   currently unclear with pneumosepsis or other infection vs encephalitis
   vs seizure activity and post-ictal state all being possibilities.  ICU
   delirium in the context of chronic microvascular changes is also a
   concern.   Given patient was hypoxic slightly after being found
   prolonged hypoxia and anoxic brain injury is also on the differential.
   Head CT appears stable this admission.

   #Hypotension: The patient developed somewhat fluid responsive relative
   hypotension overnight [**3-10**].  Etiology is unclear and possible
   etiologies would consider cardiogenic shock vs septic shock vs SIRS vs
   neurogenic shock.  Cardiogenic shock considered less likely due to no
   signs of volume overload.  Other etiologies both have some evidence to
   support. Cards consulted in am [**3-8**] and looking at Tokatsubo

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain on oxycodone, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible Crohn's disease. She presented with altered mental status and fever after being found down by her son. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, requiring intubation due to agitation and hypoxia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode, receiving 500 mL of tidal volume, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and a plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/66 to 118/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. She has received multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. EKG changes include persistent T-wave inversions in V1-V6 and low voltage in limb leads. The patient's condition is complex, with potential medical complications including cardi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain on methadone, severe COPD with pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), home oxygen use, Crohn's disease on steroids, and hypoxemic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia (PNA). She presented with transient episodes of high oxygen needs and EKG changes, raising the question of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy versus a CNS event. She is currently experiencing severe respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration PNA/pneumonitis, as well as hypotension with EKG changes consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or a CNS event. The patient also has altered mental status, which is her third episode without focal deficits, pancreatitis with elevated lipase, and other issues mentioned in the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires mechanical ventilation due to severe COPD exacerbation and aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if adequate ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there are EKG changes suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is important to monitor and manage blood pressure carefully to prevent further complications.

3. Infection: The patient has worsening CXR, fever, and elevated WBC count, indicating a possible infection. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored appropriately, and the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain on methadone, severe COPD with pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), and Crohn's disease on steroids. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient also has a possible episode of pancreatitis and has been found unconscious on multiple occasions without any neurologic work-up findings. 

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration PNA, hypotension with transient EKG changes suggesting Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or a CNS event, altered mental status (now improving) with a history of three episodes, and pancreatitis with elevated lipase but no acute abdominal pathology on CT scan.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), a heart rate of 79 bpm with a range of 78-112 bpm, a blood pressure of 69/45 mmHg with a range of 56-118/83 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute with a range of 10-23 breaths per minute, an oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 21 mmHg with a range of 6-33 mmHg.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including mechanical ventilation with assist/support modes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, Crohn's disease, and methadone use. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has had transient episodes of high oxygen need and EKG changes, raising the question of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or central nervous system (CNS) event. She is now experiencing respiratory failure secondary to worsening aspiration pneumonia, hypotension with EKG changes consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or CNS event, and altered mental status for the third time. Other issues include pancreatitis with elevated lipase, which has since normalized. The patient requires mechanical ventilation and is being weaned to pressure support. Antibiotics are being tailored to include levofloxacin. Cardiology input is needed due to the EKG changes. Neurological input is also required for the altered mental status, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) is planned. Pancreatitis is being monitored with abdominal computed tomography (CT) showing no acute pathology. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and peripheral IV line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain on methadone, severe COPD with pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), home oxygen therapy (home O2), Crohn's disease on steroids, and previous episodes of being found unresponsive with negative neuro work-ups. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and later developed transient episodes of hyperglycemia (HOTN) with EKG changes, raising the question of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy versus a CNS event.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration PNA, severe COPD at baseline, and worsening chest X-ray (CXR) with fever and elevated white blood cell count. She also has hypotension with EKG changes that could be due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or a CNS event. Her altered mental status has improved but is her third episode, with no focal deficits. There is a suspicion of pancreatitis with elevated lipase, but it has since normalized. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration PNA. This can lead to worsening hypoxemia and further lung complications.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and worsening CXR suggest a possible infection. If not appropriately managed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain, severe COPD with pulmonary hypertension, Crohn's disease on steroids, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient was found lethargic at home, minimal responsive to narcan, and intubated in the emergency department due to copious secretions and aspiration. There are concerns for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

The patient has altered mental status, epigastric tenderness with elevated lipase and fever, elevated WBC, and significant sputum with +GS. There is a possible diagnosis of pancreatitis, but no history of alcohol use or toxic screen, with lipase trending downward and no acute pathology on abdominal CT.

The patient also has respiratory failure, severe COPD at baseline, home oxygen, pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia versus tracheobronchitis. The patient requires mechanical ventilation, and the set rate on the ventilator is being decreased, currently causing iatrogenic relative respiratory alkalosis.

Additionally, the patient has hypotension with EKG changes, responding to intravenous fluid boluses. The EKG shows new deep T-wave inversions, low limb lead voltage, and the last troponin is trending toward improvement. There is a possibility of a new cardiac event, although ST segments are not impressive. Other possibilities include a CNS event, electrolyte abnormalities, or medication effect.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain on methadone, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with pulmonary hypertension, Crohn's disease on steroids, and hypoxemic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with transient episodes of high oxygen need and EKG changes, raising the question of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy versus a central nervous system event. The patient has severe COPD at baseline, is on home oxygen, and has hypertension. She requires mechanical ventilation and tailored antibiotics. There is also evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to increasing afterload and volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis given her altered mental status. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires tailored antibiotics.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension with EKG changes that could be indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or a central nervous system event. She does not appear septic and requires further evaluation with repeat EKG, follow-up troponins, and starting labetalol. Cardiology input is necessary.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is improving but represents her third episode. There are no focal deficits, and an EEG has been ordered. Neuro input is being considered, along with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain on methadone, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with pulmonary hypertension, Crohn's disease on steroids, and currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly pancreatitis. The patient was found lethargic at home and brought to the emergency department, where she was intubated due to minimal responsiveness to naloxone and copious secretions and aspiration. There are concerns for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as well.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia given mental status. Now with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in sputum and worsening chest X-ray, fever, and white blood cell count. The plan includes mechanical ventilation, weaning to pressure support, and continuing antibiotics.
2. Hypotension: EKG changes consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy versus central nervous system event. The plan includes intravenous fluid bolus responsive with stable blood pressure today, repeat EKG, follow troponins, and cardiology input.
3. Altered mental status: Now improving, but this is her third episode. There are no focal deficits. The plan includes an electroencephalogram (EEG), neurology input, serial neuro exams, and lumbar puncture deferred.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with multiple medical problems including HTN, PVD,
   chronic pain on oxycodone, OSA, ? Crohn
s disease and on multiple
   sedating meds who presented with altered mental status and fever after
   being found down by her son.
   #. Altered mental status:  This was the initial etiology of the
   patient
s need for intubation.  Differential is broad but given
   significant agitation component and lack of focality some suggestion
   this is most likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy or delirium.  No
   nuchal rigidity, photophobia, or focal neural deficits.  Etiology
   currently unclear with pneumosepsis or other infection vs encephalitis
   vs seizure activity and post-ictal state all being possibilities.  ICU
   delirium in the context of chronic microvascular changes is also a
   concern.   Given patient was hypoxic slightly after being found
   prolonged hypoxia and anoxic brain injury is also on the differential.
   Head CT appears stable this admission.  Neuro consulted on [**3-9**] and did
   uncover some focal deficits.
   - f/u neuro reccs
   - f/u EEG and MRI head
   -have been in contact with [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8178**] preceptor for pt
s PCP.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Liklely respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation at baseline secondary to COPD.  Given pneumonia
   potential for tiring in already suboptimal lung now burdened with
   infiltrate.  RSBI of 25 on SBT on [**3-9**] so will attempt to extubate.
   - continue levo (day 1 = [**3-9**]) for aspiration pneumonia
   - diurese with goal of -500cc to -1L as CXR shows pulmonary edema and
   [**Last Name (un) **] unlikely prerenal in etiology
   - initiate ipratropium nebs for hx of COPD
   - hold albuterol nebs in setting of tachycardia
   # ?Takatsubo
s cardiomyopathy: Initially was thought to be hypotensive
   overnight on [**3-9**] but patient was found to have a 10 to 30 mmHg
   systolic blood pressure difference between left radial a-line (lower)
   and right brachial cuff (higher).  Following noninvasive blood
   pressures and using a-line for ABGs.  Persistent T-wave inversions in
   V1-V6; no ECHO evidence of Takatsubo
s at this time but may have been
   present earlier in patient
s presentation.
   - touch base with cards re: changing labetalol to metoprolol
   -Following LUE non-invasive BP
   #  Acute Kidney Injury:  Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, AIN
   secondary to antibiotic allergy, or ATN in setting of prior episodes of
   possible hypotension and hypoperfusion.  FeNa<1% but patient
s FeUrea
   45% in setting of lasix treatment.
   - f/u urine lytes, osmolality, sediment, eosinophils
   - will continue diuresis today because pre-renal azotemia unlikely.
   #. Pancreatitis:  Minimal elevations in amylase and lipase here despite
   reported very high level at OSH.  This does not seem to be the etiology
   of the patient
s symptoms.
   #. Crohns Disease:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**]; per OMR  notes, this
   diagnosis is mainly symptom based with little objective evidence.  EGD
   and colonoscopy normal in 1/[**2150**].  PO budesonide minimally absorbed but
   as she is on this chronically and adrenal insufficiency is on the
   differential for hypotension we will check for adrenal insufficiency.
   -stress dose hydrocort for now but will transition to home dose of
   budesonide after extubation
   #. Chronic Pain:  On fentanyl for sedation, holding other opiates.
   #. HTN: holding lisinopril in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].  Currently on labetalol
   instead of home dose of atenolol per cardiology reccs.
   #. Cushings syndrome:  Secondary to chronic prednisone.  Steroid
   management as above.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: stable.
   - continue atorvostatin
   #. Obstructive sleep apnea:  Will clarify whether patient uses BiPap at
   home.
   #. Depression/anxiety: Will restart home meds today.
   #. COPD:  On baseline home O2 of 3L and has a long smoking history.
   Respiratory failure management as above.
   #. Cor pulmonale:  Has [**3-18**]+ TR at baseline.  Continue to follow.
   #. PVD s/p bilateral CIA stenting in [**6-/2149**]:  continue to follow
    EMERGENCY CONTACT: HCP is sister: [**Name (NI) 141**] [**Name (NI) 8149**] at
   [**Telephone/Fax (5) 8150**] and secondary HCP is son [**Name (NI) 268**] [**Name (NI) 8151**] at

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain on oxycodone, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible Crohn's disease. She presented with altered mental status and fever after being found down by her son. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and has undergone several interventions. The neuro consult has been called for further evaluation of her altered mental status, with plans to follow up with an EEG and try to wean sedating medications. An MRI of the head has shown scattered white matter lesions in the parietal lobe. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/80 mmHg to 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. 

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 134 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals no focal neurological deficits, but there are scattered petechiae on her lower extremities. 

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain on oxycodone, obstructive"

   #Hypotension: The patient developed somewhat fluid responsive relative
   hypotension overnight [**3-10**].  Etiology is unclear and possible
   etiologies would consider cardiogenic shock vs septic shock vs SIRS vs
   neurogenic shock.  Cardiogenic shock considered less likely due to no

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain on oxycodone, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible Crohn's disease. She presented with altered mental status and fever after being found down by her son.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics (initially vancomycin, flagyl, and cipro, then switched to levofloxacin), an echocardiogram showing normal left ventricular ejection fraction, a consultation with neurology for further evaluation of altered mental status, starting hydrocortisone for budesonide replacement, and tapering antibiotics to just levofloxacin.

The patient also has several allergies, including penicillins, Darvocet-N 100, aspirin, Amitriptyline, and Wellbutrin. She has been on multiple sedating medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/80 to 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg.

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/d"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with multiple medical problems including HTN, PVD,
   chronic pain on oxycodone, OSA, ? Crohn
s disease and on multiple
   sedating meds who presented with altered mental status and fever after
   being found down by her son.
   #. Altered mental status:  This was the initial etiology of the
   patient
s need for intubation.  Differential is broad but given
   significant agitation component and lack of focality some suggestion
   this is most likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy or delirium.  No
   nuchal rigidity, photophobia, or focal neural deficits.  Etiology
   currently unclear with pneumosepsis or other infection vs encephalitis
   vs seizure activity and post-ictal state all being possibilities.  ICU
   delirium in the context of chronic microvascular changes is also a
   concern.   Given patient was hypoxic slightly after being found
   prolonged hypoxia and anoxic brain injury is also on the differential.
   Head CT appears stable this admission.  Neuro consulted on [**3-9**] and did
   uncover some focal deficits.
   - f/u neuro reccs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic pain on oxycodone, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and possible Crohn's disease. She presented with altered mental status and fever after being found down by her son.

The patient has been in the ICU since [**2150-3-7**] and has undergone several interventions and evaluations. The note highlights various potential medical complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient initially required intubation due to agitation and lack of focus. The differential diagnosis includes toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, delirium, infection (pneumosepsis or encephalitis), seizure activity, post-ictal state, or chronic microvascular changes. Neuro consult was called, and an EEG and MRI head are planned.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She also has pneumonia, which may contribute to her respiratory distress. Ventilation weaning and diuresis are being considered.

3. Hypotension: The patient developed fluid-responsive relative hypotension overnight. Possible etiologies include septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or neurogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is less likely due to no signs of volume overload. Cardiac consultation was obtained, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain, severe COPD, hypertension, and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. She also has a history of transient episodes of hot nerve involvement and EKG changes, raising the question of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or CNS event. The patient's mental status has improved, but she has had three episodes of altered mental status without focal deficits. Her respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia and worsening chest X-ray. She has MSSA in her sputum and fever, indicating a possible infection. The patient also has volume overload and sensitivity to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). She is on atrovent and steroids for severe COPD and hypertension. The plan is to extubate the patient today and consider CPAP if there are any difficulties with edema after extubation. Diuretics will be continued, and she may require levo. The patient's altered mental status is improving but requires further evaluation with an EEG and consultation with a neurologist. Her hypotension is likely due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or a CNS event, and it has now resolved. She is on chronic steroids for Crohn's disease, so stress dose steroids may be required. A beta-blocker may also be necessary, and repeat EKGs will be done. The patient's rising creatinine levels"

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain, severe COPD, hypertension, and Crohn's disease. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. She has had transient episodes of high oxygen needs and EKG changes, raising the question of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy versus a CNS event. The patient's mental status has improved but this is her third episode. There are no focal deficits. She has MSSA in her sputum and worsening CXR, fever, and WBC count. She also has severe COPD, home oxygen dependence, and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has been extubated and is now on CPAP. She requires diuresis and further evaluation for altered mental status, including an EEG and neurology consultation. She also needs a repeat echocardiogram to assess for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and a stress dose of steroids due to chronic steroid use for Crohn's disease.

Additionally, the patient has rising creatinine levels, likely due to acute renal failure (ARF), which could be intrinsic or related to myopathy. Further monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, along with urine electrolytes.

Other issues include the need for continued glycemic control and nutrition support. The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The use of restraints should be reviewed regularly. The patient's code status is full"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of chronic pain, severe COPD, hypertension, and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has had transient episodes of high oxygen need with EKG changes, raising the question of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or a CNS event. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by worsening CXR, fever, and elevated WBC count. There is also an element of volume overload with PEEP sensitivity. The patient's altered mental status is improving but this is her third episode. An EEG and neuro consult are planned. Hypotension with EKG changes consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has resolved. Rising creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure or myopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to further lung damage and complications such as sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has an element of volume overload with PEEP sensitivity, which may result in pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's repeated episodes of altered mental status could indicate underlying neurological issues, such as seizures or a CNS infection.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's EKG changes suggest Takotsubo cardiomyopathy"

   55 year-old female with multiple medical problems including HTN, PVD,
   chronic pain on oxycodone, OSA, ? Crohn
s disease and on multiple
   sedating meds who presented with altered mental status and fever after
   being found down by her son.
   #. Altered mental status:  This was the initial etiology of the
   patient
s need for intubation.  Differential is broad but given
   significant agitation component and lack of focality some suggestion
   this is most likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy or delirium.  No
   nuchal rigidity, photophobia, or focal neural deficits.  Etiology
   currently unclear with pneumosepsis or other infection vs encephalitis
   vs seizure activity and post-ictal state all being possibilities.  ICU
   delirium in the context of chronic microvascular changes is also a
   concern.   Given patient was hypoxic slightly after being found
   prolonged hypoxia and anoxic brain injury is also on the differential.
   Head CT appears stable this admission.  Neuro consulted on [**3-9**] and did
   uncover some focal deficits.
   - f/u neuro reccs
   - f/u EEG and MRI head
   -have been in contact with [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8178**] preceptor for pt
s PCP.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Liklely respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation at baseline secondary to COPD.  Given pneumonia
   potential for tiring in already suboptimal lung now burdened with
   infiltrate.  RSBI of 25 on SBT on [**3-9**] so will attempt to extubate.
   - continue levo (day 1 = [**3-9**]) for aspiration pneumonia
   - diurese with goal of -500cc to -1L as CXR shows pulmonary edema and
   [**Last Name (un) **] unlikely prerenal in etiology
   - initiate ipratropium nebs for hx of COPD
   - hold albuterol nebs in setting of tachycardia
   # ?Takatsubo
s cardiomyopathy: Initially was thought to be hypotensive
   overnight on [**3-9**] but patient was found to have a 10 to 30 mmHg
   systolic blood pressure difference between left radial a-line (lower)
   and right brachial cuff (higher).  Following noninvasive blood
   pressures and using a-line for ABGs.  Persistent T-wave inversions in
   V1-V6; no ECHO evidence of Takatsubo
s at this time but may have been
   present earlier in patient
s presentation.
   - touch base with cards re: changing labetalol to metoprolol
   -Following LUE non-invasive BP
   #  Acute Kidney Injury:  Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, AIN
   secondary to antibiotic allergy, or ATN in setting of prior episodes of
   possible hypotension and hypoperfusion.  FeNa<1% but patient
s FeUrea
   45% in setting of lasix treatment.
   - f/u urine lytes, osmolality, sediment, eosinophils
   - will continue diuresis today because pre-renal azotemia unlikely.
   #. Pancreatitis:  Minimal elevations in amylase and lipase here despite
   reported very high level at OSH.  This does not seem to be the etiology
   of the patient
s symptoms.
   #. Crohns Disease:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**]; per OMR  notes, this
   diagnosis is mainly symptom based with little objective evidence.  EGD
   and colonoscopy normal in 1/[**2150**].  PO budesonide minimally absorbed but
   as she is on this chronically and adrenal insufficiency is on the
   differential for hypotension we will check for adrenal insufficiency.
   -stress dose hydrocort for now but will transition to home dose of
   budesonide after extubation
   #. Chronic Pain:  On fentanyl for sedation, holding other opiates.
   #. HTN: holding lisinopril in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].  Currently on labetalol
   instead of home dose of atenolol per cardiology reccs.
   #. Cushings syndrome:  Secondary to chronic prednisone.  Steroid
   management as above.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: stable.
   - continue atorvostatin
   #. Obstructive sleep apnea:  Will clarify whether patient uses BiPap at
   home.
   #. Depression/anxiety: Will restart home meds today.
   #. COPD:  On baseline home O2 of 3L and has a long smoking history.
   Respiratory failure management as above.
   #. Cor pulmonale:  Has [**3-18**]+ TR at baseline.  Continue to follow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain on oxycodone, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible Crohn's disease. She presented with altered mental status and fever after being found down by her son. The patient required intubation due to altered mental status, and subsequent tests revealed a broad differential diagnosis including toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, delirium, pneumosepsis, encephalitis, seizure activity, post-ictal state, chronic microvascular changes, and prolonged hypoxia/anoxic brain injury. Neurological consultation was performed, and focal deficits were identified. The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation secondary to COPD, as well as pulmonary edema. There is a suspicion of Takasubo cardiomyopathy, but no evidence of it has been found so far. Acute kidney injury is also present, with a differential diagnosis including pre-renal azotemia, allergic interstitial nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis. Pancreatitis is minimal, and Crohn's disease is mainly symptom-based. The patient has chronic pain, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, depression/anxiety, and COPD.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   55 year-old female with multiple medical problems including HTN, PVD,
   chronic pain on oxycodone, OSA, ? Crohn
s disease and on multiple
   sedating meds who presented with altered mental status and fever after
   being found down by her son.
   #. Altered mental status:  This was the initial etiology of the
   patient
s need for intubation.  Differential is broad but given
   significant agitation component and lack of focality some suggestion
   this is most likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy or delirium.  No
   nuchal rigidity, photophobia, or focal neural deficits.   Considered
   diagnoses included:  pneumosepsis or other infection, encephalitis,
   seizure activity and post-ictal state,  ICU delirium in the context of
   chronic microvascular changes, prolonged hypoxia and anoxic brain
   injury and oversedation from medication.  Head CT appears stable this
   admission.  Neuro consulted on [**3-9**]- they state although this is the
   3^rd time pt has had similar presentation that most likely etiology is
   toxic metabolic perhaps oversedation from medications. Final MRI Head
   read unchanged except possible ectatic vessel w/ cannot r/o vasculitis
   -have been in contact with [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8178**] preceptor for pt
s PCP.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Liklely respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation at baseline secondary to COPD.  Given pneumonia
   potential for tiring in already suboptimal lung now burdened with
   infiltrate.  Extubated successfully [**3-10**]
   - continue levo (day 1 = [**3-9**]) for aspiration pneumonia for 7 days
   - ipratropium nebs for now. Will transition to back to spiriva prior to
   d/c
   - hold albuterol nebs in setting of tachycardia
   # ?Takatsubo
s cardiomyopathy: Initially was thought to be hypotensive
   overnight on [**3-9**] but patient was found to have a 10 to 30 mmHg
   systolic blood pressure difference between left radial a-line (lower)
   and right brachial cuff (higher).  Following noninvasive blood
   pressures and using a-line for ABGs.  Persistent T-wave inversions in
   V1-V6; no ECHO evidence of Takatsubo
s at this time but may have been
   present earlier in patient
s presentation. Pt changed from labetalol to
   metoprolol yesterday.
   -Following LUE non-invasive BP
   #  Acute Kidney Injury:  Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, AIN
   secondary to antibiotic allergy, or ATN in setting of prior episodes of
   possible hypotension and hypoperfusion.  FeNa<1% but patient
s FeUrea
   45% in setting of lasix treatment. Cr. Remains stable at 1.3 today
   possibly incr [**2-16**] diuresis
   - will continue to monitor
   #. Pancreatitis:  Minimal elevations in amylase and lipase here despite
   reported very high level at OSH.  This does not seem to be the etiology
   of the patient
s symptoms.
   #. Crohns Disease:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1604**]; per OMR  notes, this
   diagnosis is mainly symptom based with little objective evidence.  EGD
   and colonoscopy normal in 1/[**2150**].  PO budesonide minimally absorbed but
   as she is on this chronically and adrenal insufficiency is on the
   differential for hypotension we will check for adrenal insufficiency.
   -d/c
d hydrocort today and restarted budesonide at home dose
   #. Chronic Pain:  On Q 4 percocet for now (lower than home dose
   narcotics but moderately helping with pain). Also restarted pregabalin
   #. HTN: holding lisinopril in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].  Currently on metoprolol
    instead of home dose of atenolol as this is shorter acting.
   #. Cushings syndrome:  Secondary to chronic prednisone.  Steroid
   management as above.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: stable.
   - continue atorvostatin
   #. Obstructive sleep apnea:  Will clarify whether patient uses BiPap at
   home.
   #. Depression/anxiety: Home meds restarted at lower doses incl
   seroquel, duloxetine
   #. COPD:  On baseline home O2 of 3L and has a long smoking history.
   Cont NC at 3L today
   #. Cor pulmonale:  Has [**3-18**]+ TR at baseline.  Continue to follow.
   #. PVD s/p bilateral CIA stenting in [**6-/2149**]:  continue to follow
    EMERGENCY CONTACT: HCP is sister: [**Name (NI) 141**] [**Name (NI) 8149**] at
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8150**] and secondary HCP is son [**Name (NI) 268**] [**Name (NI) 8151**] at

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pain, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible Crohn's disease. She presented with altered mental status and fever after being found down by her son. She was intubated initially due to altered mental status but has since been extubated successfully. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia, and is receiving appropriate treatment. There is suspicion of Takasubo cardiomyopathy, which is causing a blood pressure difference between the left radial artery line and the right brachial cuff. The patient's acute kidney injury is likely pre-renal azotemia, possibly due to hypotension and hypoperfusion. She has minimal elevations in amylase and lipase, suggesting pancreatitis. Her chronic pain has been managed with narcotics, and she has restarted on pregabalin. The patient's other medical conditions include Crohn's disease, hypertension (on metoprolol instead of atenolol), hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, depression/anxiety, COPD, cor pulmonale, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's family history includes adrenal insufficiency. She has been on multiple sedating medications, which have been reduced. The patient's MRI head shows a possible ectatic vessel that cannot be ruled out as vasculitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is following"
