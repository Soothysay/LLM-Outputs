   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen (note: only 2 of the
   lumens can be used)
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, will
   reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run VT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM,
   reported prior CVA s/p cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide
   complex perfusing rhythm. ED code STEMI was called for inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA
   s/p bare metal stent. Patient unstable in cath lab required multiple
   pressors, ballon pump and temp wire. Patient continues to be intubated,
   on pressors, with balloon pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   *************************************
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis vs. DKA. Serum tox
   negative. Patient does not take metformin as outpatient. Delta-delta
   1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   - Treat possible DKA: Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**], replete K > 3.3,
   follow-up serum ketones
   - Lactic Acidosis: repleted bicarb total 250 meq
   - Increase vent RR to compensate metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated.
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - renal to eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - For now attempt Lasix bolus and drip for diuresis
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Currently GS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation and
   cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -overall very poor prognosis
   -neuro team to follow, appreciate input
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab.
   - send urine lytes
   - renal to eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed.
   FEN: NPO
   .
   ACCESS: Femoral vein and arterial cath.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sq
   -Pain management with sedation
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace
   -Famotidine 20 mg IV

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, previous cerebrovascular accident, peripheral arterial disease with stents, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prostate cancer. He presented with a cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular tachycardia and had an inferior STEMI with anterolateral ST depressions. Coronary angiography demonstrated chronic total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery with collaterals, and an acute distally occluded right coronary artery for which a bare metal stent was placed. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with a low ejection fraction (25%), cool extremities, and poor peripheral oxygen saturation. He is receiving multiple vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure above 50 mmHg, and is also on a balloon pump.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low ejection fraction, cool extremities, and poor peripheral oxygen saturation indicate cardiogenic shock. This condition is a potential complication of the STEMI and may require further interventions.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient has patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray, suggesting possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is likely due to cardiogenic shock and fluid overload. The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with inadequate compensation. The etiology is most"

   complex perfusing rhythm. ED code STEMI was called for inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA
   s/p bare metal stent. Patient unstable in cath lab required multiple
   pressors, ballon pump and temp wire. Patient continues to be intubated,
   on pressors, with balloon pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct

   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic

   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture

   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with stents, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, and borderline diabetes. He presented with a cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and was resuscitated. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with a STEMI and had an acute thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA), for which a bare metal stent was placed. However, the patient remained unstable and required multiple pressors, balloon pump, and temporary wire.

The patient is currently intubated and on ventilatory support with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) being weaned down. He is also on various pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50, including levophed, epinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. The goal is to wean dopamine and then epinephrine. He is also on a heparin infusion and a lasix drip. The patient has a balloon pump in place and is being warmed as part of the Arctic Sun cooling protocol.

The patient has an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus, and he is being treated with keppra and midazolam. His cardiac function is severely compromised, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He presented with a cardiac arrest due to a STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient has been intubated and is on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. He is also on a balloon pump and has had a bare metal stent placed in the RCA. The patient's current condition is complicated by several factors, including acute kidney injury, hyperglycemia, respiratory distress with pulmonary edema, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient's prognosis is poor, and a family meeting was held to discuss further management options.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's current state of cardiogenic shock may continue to worsen if the heart function does not improve.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.9, and he has now developed acute renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate fluid balance and renal dose medications.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient is showing signs of insulin resistance, which could be part of the sympathomimetic treatment or the overall ischemic state. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and administration of insulin are necessary.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient has patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicating pulmonary ed"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, prior cerebrovascular accident, peripheral arterial disease with stents, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, and borderline diabetes. The patient presented with cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and was resuscitated to a wide complex perfusing rhythm. In the emergency department, a code STEMI was called for inferior ST elevations and anterolateral ST depressions. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have acute thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) after placement of a bare metal stent. The patient was unstable in the cath lab and required multiple pressors, balloon pump, and temporary wire.

The patient remains intubated on a ventilator with slowly weaning off pressors and the balloon pump. The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus rhythm. The patient's ejection fraction is severely depressed at 25%, and there is evidence of right ventricular infarction. The patient has been treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and statin therapy.

The patient has a significant acid-base disorder with an anion gap metabolic acidosis, most likely due to lactate acidosis. There is also evidence of acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. The patient's respiratory status is complicated by pulmonary edema secondary to cardiogenic shock,"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed

   DISPO: CCU for now. Poor prognosis. Family meeting was yesterday; will
   follow-up today.
","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, prior cerebrovascular accident, peripheral arterial disease with stents, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, and borderline diabetes. He presented with a STEMI and was resuscitated from cardiac arrest due to unstable VT and RCA RV infarction. He remains intubated and on multiple pressors with a balloon pump.

His current condition includes severe global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 25%, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, trivial pericardial effusion, and a history of poor memory. He also has an active infection with non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is being treated with levetiracetam and midazolam. His renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level, and he has hyperglycemia with insulin resistance.

The patient's plan includes weaning off the ventilator and pressors, rewarming, and addressing his various medical complications such as acid-base disorder, respiratory distress, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and neurologic issues. He is on multiple medications including vasopressin, heparin, fentanyl, amiodarone, lasix, vecuronium, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, insulin, and midazolam.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening"

   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.

   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50

   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake

   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase

   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)

   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload

   ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.   I was present during the entire portion of the
   physical examination.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9204**] is a 77 year old man who suffered an inferior wall STEMI
   complicated by cardiogenic shock earlier this AM.  He was treated with
   PCI using a BMS in the distal RCA following thrombectomy with the
   support of a pacemaker and IABP.
   He was cooled for 24 hours for neuro protection and is now warm.  There
   has been no return in her neurologic function.  His IABP was removed
   for leg leg ischemia and he is currently on reduced pressor
   requirements.  This resulted in a doppler left popliteal and faint PT
   pulse. He is urinating > 100 cc clear urine per hour.
   We have continued all aggressive supportive care until his prognosis in
   better defined tomorrow.
   His prognosis for long-term recovery remains uncertain and this has
   been discussed with his wife and family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He was admitted with an inferior wall STEMI and cardiogenic shock, for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and stent placement in the distal right coronary artery. The patient was cooled for neuroprotection but did not show any improvement in neurological function. He experienced leg ischemia and had to have his intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removed. The patient is currently on reduced pressor requirements and is producing clear urine. His prognosis for long-term recovery remains uncertain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's initial presentation included cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition where the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient had an inferior wall STEMI, indicating a heart attack that can result in permanent damage to the heart muscle if not managed effectively.
3. Leg Ischemia: The patient developed leg ischemia, which is a condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the legs. This can lead to tissue damage and potentially limb loss if not addressed promptly.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure, possibly due to hypoperfusion. This is a serious condition that can lead to the"
