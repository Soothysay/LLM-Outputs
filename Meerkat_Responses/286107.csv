   - re-check hct to confirm
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - evaluate haptoglobin level
   - guiac stool positive
   -GI consult placed, will make patient NPO/hold TF for possible EGD in
   AM, will likely need colonoscopy in future
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter

   # Recurrent SDH: Likley the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head today, no acute bleed.
   Speech and swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental
   status.  Would need PEG if this was consistent w/ goals of care.
   - discuss goals of care with family
   - Appreciate neurology recs regarding Keppra.  Will get EEG, if normal,
   will discontinue Keppra to see if mental status improves.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of recent subdural hematomas (SDH) after boreholes, recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted with hypoxia due to large mucus plugs, which has now resolved. The patient's anemia etiology is unclear, with no evidence of recurrent SDH or gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been receiving packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is on hold from tube feeds. There are concerns about recurrent DVTs, recurrent SDH contributing to poor overall functional and mental status, transaminitis, and hypernatremia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypernatremia, and subdural hemorrhage. The patient is being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent DVTs: The patient has a history of recurrent DVTs and an IVC filter in place. Stopping anticoagulants may increase the risk of new thrombosis or embolism.
2. Recurrent SDH: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to recurrent SDH, which needs to be managed and prevented from worsening.
3. Anemia: The cause of anemia is unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma (SDH), recurrent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and persistent altered mental status. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. He has been restarted on tube feeds and repleted with potassium. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped significantly overnight, with an unclear source, and his hematocrit level is currently at 25.2%. The patient has allergies to penicillins and is on several medications including pantoprazole, protonix, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent DVTs: The patient has a history of recurrent DVTs, which could potentially lead to further clot formation and pulmonary embolism.
2. Anemia: The sudden drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels suggests acute blood loss or ongoing bleeding, which needs to be investigated further.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be attributed to large mucus plugs, which can obstruct the airways and compromise oxygenation.
4. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has high sodium levels, indicating a possible imbalance in fluid and electrolyte management.
5. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient's history of recurrent SDH puts him at risk"

   Disposition:
","The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's Hct dropped from 31 to 24 overnight, which indicates significant blood loss. The presence of subdural hemorrhage (SDH) on the assessment and plan suggests that this could be the source of the blood loss. 

The patient also has respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for respiratory support and the ABG results showing a respiratory acidosis with an elevated PCO2 level. This indicates inadequate ventilation and gas exchange.

Additionally, the patient has deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, hypernatremia (high sodium), and a history of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium) that required repletion. These findings suggest the patient may have multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to severe sepsis or septic shock.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The elevated WBC indicates an ongoing infection or inflammation, while the elevated Hct may be due to acute blood loss or ongoing bleeding. The elevated Plt could be secondary to the stress response or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's glucose levels are consistently elevated, suggesting poor glycemic control. The kidney function tests show mildly decreased creatinine and urinalysis results.

Given the severity of the patient's condition, close monitoring and aggressive management"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.  This is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Secondary to very large mucus plugs (X 3) as were evident
   w/ suctioning.  His hypoxia is now resolved.  This seems largely
   secondary to inability to mobilize secretions in the setting of large
   SDH.  He has increased secretions today, he is coughing, will suction
   as needed.
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more somnolent yesterday prior to discontinuing
   Keppra and dementia medications per Neuro.
   - F/u EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Mildly increased from yesterday, however afebrile.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to stress.
   - Will check UA and recheck cultures
   - trend daily
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC.
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, do not think they will do any
   procedure today, just watch and wait to see if there is subsequent hct
   drops or more bleeding.  Will restart tube feeds today
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likley the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head today, no acute bleed.
   Speech and swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental
   status.  Would need PEG if this was consistent w/ goals of care.
   - discuss goals of care with family
   - Appreciate neurology recs regarding Keppra.  Will get EEG, if normal,
   will discontinue Keppra to see if mental status improves.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes
   X 2, also w/ recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently
   altered mental status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus
   plugs.  This is now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia: This was clearly from very large mucus plugs (X 3) as were
   evident w/ suctioning.  His hypoxia is now resolved.  This seems
   largely secondary to inability to mobilize secretions in the setting of
   large SDH.
   - humidified air
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC yesterday.
   - re-check hct to confirm
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - evaluate haptoglobin level
   - guiac stool positive
   -GI consult placed, will make patient NPO/hold TF for possible EGD in
   AM, will likely need colonoscopy in future
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likley the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head today, no acute bleed.
   Speech and swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental
   status.  Would need PEG if this was consistent w/ goals of care.
   - discuss goals of care with family
   - Appreciate neurology recs regarding Keppra.  Will get EEG, if normal,
   will discontinue Keppra to see if mental status improves.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, Tube feeds
   via dopoff-NPO after midnight

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma (SDH) and recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient is currently in the ICU due to persistently altered mental status, now resolved after hypoxia caused by large mucus plugs.
- The patient's anemia etiology is unclear, and there is no evidence of recurrent SDH or gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient has a positive guaiac stool test, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding, and a GI consult has been placed.
- The patient's recurrent DVTs have led to the placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
- The patient's mental status is likely due to recurrent SDH, with no acute bleed seen on CT head today.
- Speech and swallow evaluation cannot be performed due to the patient's mental status.
- The neurology team recommends an EEG to evaluate for seizure activity, and if negative, to discontinue Keppra (an anti-seizure medication).
- The patient's electrolytes are replete, and tube feeds will be started via dopoff, with NPO status after midnight.
- The patient is on prophylaxis for pneumoboots and has a double-lumen PICC line in place.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of recent subdural hematoma (SDH) and recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), currently admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with persistently altered mental status, which has improved after discontinuing Keppra and dementia medications. The patient also experienced hypoxia secondary to large mucus plugs, but this has now resolved.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate between 86-112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/66 to 169/102 mmHg, respiratory rate between 17-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, transaminitis, and electrolyte imbalances. The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxia: Resolved due to large mucus plugs, now managed with humidified air, chest physiotherapy, and suctioning as needed.

2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): Improved after discontinuing Keppra and dementia medications. Follow-up EEG and neurology recommendations to be followed.

3. Leukocytosis: Mildly increased from yesterday, but afebrile. Will check urinalysis and recheck cultures, trending daily.

4. Anemia: Unclear etiology of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a medical history of recent subdural hematoma (SDH), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She was admitted with persistently altered mental status and hypoxia due to large mucus plugs. Her hypoxia has now resolved after suctioning. She has increased secretions and is coughing, so she will be suctioned as needed.

The patient's leukocyte count is mildly increased, but she is afebrile. This may be secondary to stress. Cultures and urinalysis will be checked, and the leukocyte count will be trended daily.

The patient has anemia with an unclear etiology of blood loss. There is no evidence of recurrent SDH or rectal bleeding. She received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC). Heparin and coumadin were discontinued due to recurrent bleeding and her hemoglobin drop. There is no evidence of hemolysis, and her gastrointestinal (GI) consultation did not recommend any procedure today. The patient will restart tube feeds today.

The patient has a history of recurrent DVTs, and she underwent an IVC filter placement. She has a history of recurrent subdural hematomas. Her most recent CT head showed no acute bleed, but her mental status remains poor. Speech and swallow evaluation was not performed due to her"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.  This is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ ? PNA:  Secondary to very large mucus plugs (X 3) as were
   evident w/ suctioning.  His hypoxia is now resolved.  This seems
   largely secondary to inability to mobilize secretions in the setting of
   large SDH.  He has continued secretions requiring suctioning.   However
   patient has been febrile overnight with elevated white count.  Will
   start treating for possible pneumonia given questionable RML infiltrate
   on CXR this AM.
   - Start levofloxacin and vancomycin today for empiric coverage
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more alert following discontinuation of Keppra and
   dementia medications.
   - EEG did not show evidence of seizure
   - Neuro recs, no need to restart keppra and dementia meds at this time
   - Son believes the patient is much more alert and oriented today
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC.
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, do not think they will do any
   procedure today, just watch and wait to see if there is subsequent hct
   drops or more bleeding which there has not been
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likely the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head, no acute bleed.  Speech and
   swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status.
   Would need PEG in the future, but currently getting feeds from tube
   feeds.
   - Appreciate neurology recs.  Discontinued keppra.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, Tube feeds
   via dopoff-NPO after midnight

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of recent subdural hematoma (SDH) after boreholes, recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. The patient presented with persistently altered mental status, now resolved after hypoxia due to large mucus plugs. She is currently being treated for possible pneumonia with levofloxacin and vancomycin.

The patient's physical examination revealed pinpoint pupils that are reactive bilaterally, supple neck, distant heart sounds with a regular rate, and no murmurs or rubs. Her lungs had rhonchi consistent with upper respiratory sounds, no wheezes or crackles. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds present. No rebound tenderness, guarding, or organomegaly was noted. Extremities were warm, well perfused, with 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and fever, indicating a possible infection. Blood cultures were sent. Other lab values such as hemoglobin (Hb), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), glucose, and electrolytes were within normal range. Troponin-T was negative, indicating no myocardial infarction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with acute on chronic subdural hematoma. He was admitted to the ICU due to multiple airway secretions and blood noted. His mental status has improved with the minimization of polypharmacy. However, he still has meaningful impairment in the capacity to maintain secretion clearance and airway patency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sub-Dural Hematoma - The patient has a history of chronic and stable subdural hematoma. To avoid further complications, it is important to avoid anticoagulation, regularly assess neurologic examinations, and continue with monitoring.
2. Aspiration Pneumonitis - The patient has ongoing secretions, which may lead to aspiration pneumonia. Frequent suctioning is needed to maintain clearance, and antibiotics may be required for significant infiltrates, especially in the setting of fever and rising WBC count.
3. Anemia - The patient has chronic and stable anemia. A gastrointestinal evaluation has been completed, and tube feeds will be continued as per GI recommendations.
4. Respiratory Failure - The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, but not ARDS. It is important to continue with respiratory support and monitor oxygenation levels.
5. Hypernatremia (High Sodium) - The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be managed with appropriate fluid balance and electrolyte management.
6. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH) - The patient's chronic"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.  This is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ ? PNA:  Secondary to very large mucus plugs (X 3) as were
   evident w/ suctioning.  His hypoxia is now resolved.  This seems
   largely secondary to inability to mobilize secretions in the setting of
   large SDH.  He has continued secretions requiring suctioning.   However
   patient has been febrile overnight with elevated white count.  Will
   start treating for possible pneumonia given questionable RML infiltrate
   on CXR this AM.
   - Start levofloxacin and vancomycin today for empiric coverage
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more alert following discontinuation of Keppra and
   dementia medications.
   - EEG did not show evidence of seizure
   - Neuro recs, no need to restart keppra and dementia meds at this time
   - Son believes the patient is much more alert and oriented today
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC.
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, do not think they will do any
   procedure today, just watch and wait to see if there is subsequent hct
   drops or more bleeding which there has not been
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likely the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head, no acute bleed.  Speech and
   swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status.
   Would need PEG in the future, but currently getting feeds from tube
   feeds.
   - Appreciate neurology recs.  Discontinued keppra.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, Tube feeds
   via dopoff-NPO after midnight

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of recent subdural hematoma (SDH) and recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She presented with altered mental status and large mucus plugs, which have since resolved. The patient is currently febrile with an elevated white blood cell count and a questionable right middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. Empiric coverage for possible pneumonia has been started. She has also shown improvement in alertness after discontinuing certain medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count, along with the questionable infiltrate on chest X-ray, suggest a possible pneumonia. This needs to be closely monitored and treated appropriately.
2. Aspiration: The patient's impaired ability to mobilize secretions due to large SDH increases the risk of aspiration. Close monitoring and suctioning should be done to prevent this.
3. Recurrent DVTs: Despite the placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, the patient has a history of recurrent DVTs. Continued prophylaxis and monitoring for signs of thrombosis are necessary.
4. SDH: Although the recent CT scan showed no acute bleed, the patient's mental status remains poor, likely due to the underlying SDH. Further evaluation and management are required.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes indicate transaminit"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.  This is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ ? PNA:  Secondary to very large mucus plugs (X 3) as were
   evident w/ suctioning.  His hypoxia is now resolved.  This seems
   largely secondary to inability to mobilize secretions in the setting of
   large SDH.  He has continued secretions requiring suctioning.   However
   patient has been febrile overnight with elevated white count.  Will
   start treating for possible pneumonia given apical right lower lobe
   infiltrate on CXR this AM.
   - Start will begin vanc/aztreonam/flagyl today for empiric coverage per
   ID
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   - hypotension likely from infection, treated with NS IV
   - arterial line
   - sputum culture pending
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more alert following discontinuation of Keppra and
   dementia medications.
   - EEG did not show evidence of seizure
   - Neuro recs, no need to restart keppra and dementia meds at this time
   - Son believes the patient is much more alert and oriented today
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC.
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, do not think they will do any
   procedure today, just watch and wait to see if there is subsequent hct
   drops or more bleeding which there has not been
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likely the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head, no acute bleed.  Speech and
   swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status.
   Would need PEG in the future, but currently getting feeds from tube
   feeds.
   - Appreciate neurology recs.  Discontinued keppra.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, Tube feeds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a medical history of recent subdural hematoma (SDH) surgery, recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with persistently altered mental status, now resolving hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs. The patient has been febrile overnight with an elevated white blood cell count, leading to the suspicion of pneumonia, for which empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxia/possible pneumonia, altered mental status, anemia of unclear etiology, recurrent DVTs with an IVC filter in place, recurrent SDH, transaminitis, and hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 104.1 F, blood pressure ranging from 94/62 mmHg to 148/79 mmHg, heart rate of 146 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 31.7 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 269 K/uL, elevated troponin-T level of 0.08, elevated lactate level of 1.9 mmol"

   84 yo male with significant and ongoing impairment in mental status
   even in the setting of decrease in sedating medications.  This in
   combination with evolution of significant fever, tachycardia and
   hypotension with clear evolution of what appears to be right sided
   pneumonia
concerning for aspiration pneumonia and sepsis may explain
   the changes.  His initial presentation with SDH and altered mental
   status/seizure do appear to have contributed to risk of development of
   this complication.

   -Sputum GS C+S
   2)Sepsis
Likely pulmonary source, is clearly with hypovolemia
   -IVF bolus to get to stable BP
   -If move to pressors needed will move to CVL placement for better
   monitoring
   -Levophed if needed
   3)Seizure-
   -Decrease Keppra

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.  This is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ ? PNA:  Secondary to very large mucus plugs (X 3) as were
   evident w/ suctioning.  His hypoxia is now resolved.  This seems
   largely secondary to inability to mobilize secretions in the setting of
   large SDH.  He has continued secretions requiring suctioning.   However
   patient has been febrile overnight with elevated white count.  Will
   start treating for possible pneumonia given apical right lower lobe
   infiltrate on CXR this AM.
   - Start will begin vanc/aztreonam/flagyl today for empiric coverage per
   ID
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   - hypotension likely from infection, treated with NS IV
   - arterial line
   - sputum culture pending
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more alert following discontinuation of Keppra and
   dementia medications.
   - EEG did not show evidence of seizure
   - Neuro recs, no need to restart keppra and dementia meds at this time
   - Son believes the patient is much more alert and oriented today
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC.
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, do not think they will do any
   procedure today, just watch and wait to see if there is subsequent hct
   drops or more bleeding which there has not been
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likely the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head, no acute bleed.  Speech and
   swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status.
   Would need PEG in the future, but currently getting feeds from tube
   feeds.
   - Appreciate neurology recs.  Discontinued keppra.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, Tube feeds
   via dopoff

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of recent subdural hematomas (SDH), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with persistently altered mental status, hypoxia, fever, and an elevated white blood cell count. 

The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improved alertness and worsening symptoms. The note mentions that the patient's mental status has improved after discontinuing Keppra and dementia medications, suggesting a possible medication-induced delirium. 

The patient's vital signs show persistent tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 130 to 160 beats per minute, and hypotension. The patient's respiratory status is impaired, with difficulty clearing secretions and requiring frequent suctioning. The patient's oxygen saturation is 93% on aerosol-cool delivery device, indicating some degree of respiratory compromise.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 26 mg/dL, suggesting an ongoing infection. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.  This is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ ? PNA:  Secondary to very large mucus plugs (X 3) as were
   evident w/ suctioning.  His hypoxia is now resolved.  This seems
   largely secondary to inability to mobilize secretions in the setting of
   large SDH.  He has continued secretions requiring suctioning.   However
   patient has been febrile overnight with elevated white count.  Will
   start treating for possible pneumonia given apical right lower lobe
   infiltrate on CXR worsened from yesterday AM.
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/flagyl/cipro for empiric coverage per ID
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   - hypotension likely from infection, treated with NS IV
   - arterial line
   - sputum culture pending
   - continue to monitor oxygen sats
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more alert following discontinuation of Keppra and
   dementia medications.
   - EEG did not show evidence of seizure
   - Neuro recs, no need to restart keppra and dementia meds at this time
   - Son believes the patient is much more alert and oriented off keppra,
   but had acute decompensation yesterday in setting of fever and
   tachycardia presumed to be sepsis from pneumonia
   .
   #Tachycardia/labile BP:  Likely related to infection, only transiently
   fluid responsive.  Tachycardia improves though not to normal limits
   with morphine.
   -continue morphine PRN
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC. Overnight for ScvO2 of 63
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, no EGD/scope indicated at this
   time
   - Follow HCT
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Unclear cause of increase overnight, possibly
   nutritional related.  No active bleeding
   -Monitor INR
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likely the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head, no acute bleed.  Speech and
   swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status.
   Would need PEG in the future, but currently getting feeds from tube
   feeds.
   - Appreciate neurology recs.  Discontinued keppra.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, D/c Tube
   feeds via dopoff

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of recent subdural hematomas, recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She presented with altered mental status, hypoxia, and fever, and was found to have an apical right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. She was started on empiric antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Her condition has been complicated by tachycardia, labile blood pressure, anemia, coagulopathy, and recurrent DVTs. She also has a history of transaminitis, which is improving, and her electrolytes are replete. She is currently receiving tube feeds and has been weaned off Levo. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, hypoxia, and right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest a possible pneumonia. Empiric antibiotics have been started, but she may require further treatment or may develop complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, likely due to infection. This could lead to cardiovascular instability or arrhythmias.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of low blood pressure, which may be related to infection or sepsis.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with an unclear etiology, possibly due to blood loss. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies or another underlying cause. Close monitoring of INR and appropriate management are necessary.
6. Recurrent DVTs: The patient has a history of recurrent DVTs, and she is currently on anticoagulation therapy. Monitoring for any signs of clot formation or extension is important.
7. Subdural Hematoma (SDH): The patient has a history of recurrent SDHs, which can contribute to poor functional and mental status. Continued monitoring for any signs of new or worsening bleeding is necessary.
8. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is improving. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes were initially imbalanced but are now replete. Close monitoring for any electrolyte disturbances is necessary.
10. Respiratory Failure: The patient's impaired respiratory capacity and potential pneumonia increase the risk of respiratory failure. Monitoring oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information or tests may be needed for a more comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin. The patient's mental status has declined, and he is experiencing persistent fevers. Antibiotics were changed based on ID recommendations. Right radial art line and left IJ lines were placed, but the patient's pressure increased with fluids, leading to tachycardia with a rate of 160s. Tachycardia decreased to 130 with cooling. The patient remained uncomfortable and was given morphine, ativan, and haldol. Code status was changed to DNR/DNI. The patient started on Levo for pressure and was weaned off. Replete K, Mg, Phos.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired airway clearance and impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, which may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has risk factors for DVT, including prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating a risk for hypernatremia.
4. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient's impaired balance and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition may indicate a risk for SDH.
5. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fevers indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.  This is
   now resolved.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ ? PNA:  Secondary to very large mucus plugs (X 3) as were
   evident w/ suctioning.  His hypoxia is now resolved.  This seems
   largely secondary to inability to mobilize secretions in the setting of
   large SDH.  He has continued secretions requiring suctioning.   However
   patient has been febrile overnight with elevated white count.  Will
   start treating for possible pneumonia given apical right lower lobe
   infiltrate on CXR worsened from yesterday AM.
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/flagyl/cipro for empiric coverage per ID
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   - hypotension likely from infection, treated with NS IV
   - arterial line
   - sputum culture pending
   - continue to monitor oxygen sats
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more alert following discontinuation of Keppra and
   dementia medications.
   - EEG did not show evidence of seizure
   - Neuro recs, no need to restart keppra and dementia meds at this time
   - Son believes the patient is much more alert and oriented off keppra,
   but had acute decompensation yesterday in setting of fever and
   tachycardia presumed to be sepsis from pneumonia
   .
   #Tachycardia/labile BP:  Likely related to infection, only transiently
   fluid responsive.  Tachycardia improves though not to normal limits
   with morphine.
   -continue morphine PRN
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC. Overnight for ScvO2 of 63
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, no EGD/scope indicated at this
   time
   - Follow HCT
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Unclear cause of increase overnight, possibly
   nutritional related.  No active bleeding
   -Monitor INR
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likely the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head, no acute bleed.  Speech and
   swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status.
   Would need PEG in the future, but currently getting feeds from tube
   feeds.
   - Appreciate neurology recs.  Discontinued keppra.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, D/c Tube
   feeds via dopoff

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma (SDH), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and poor overall functional and mental status. The patient presented with persistently altered mental status, hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs, and fever. The patient has been febrile overnight with an elevated white count, and there is an apical right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. The patient's condition appears to be improving with continued treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/possible pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia has been resolved, but there is an apical right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a possible pneumonia. If left untreated or not appropriately managed, this could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential respiratory failure.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has a persistently elevated heart rate, which may be related to infection. If not addressed, this could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, likely secondary to infection. If not treated appropriately, this could lead to shock and inadequate organ perfusion.
4. Anemia: The patient has an unclear etiology of blood loss. If not identified and treated, this could lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ ? PNA:  Initial hypoxia secondary to very large mucus plugs
   (X 3) as were evident w/ suctioning, but now the patient has developed
   a dense right sided pneumonia.
   - Treating empirically with vanc/aztreonam/flagyl/cipro for empiric
   coverage per ID
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   - hypotension likely from infection, treating with norepinephrine, will
   not escalate dose
   - arterial line for monitoring
   - continue to monitor oxygen sats
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more alert following discontinuation of Keppra and
   dementia medications, however mental status deteriorating given
   worsening infection.
   - EEG did not show evidence of seizure
   - Son believes the patient is much more alert and oriented off keppra,
   but had acute decompensation yesterday in setting of fever and
   tachycardia presumed to be sepsis from pneumonia.  After much
   discussion the decision was made not to escalate care and to make the
   patient DNR/DNI
   .
   #Tachycardia/labile BP:  Likely related to infection, only transiently
   fluid responsive.  Tachycardia improves though not to normal limits
   with morphine.
   -continue morphine PRN
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC. Overnight for ScvO2 of 63
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, no EGD/scope indicated at this
   time
   - Follow HCT
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Unclear cause of increase overnight, possibly
   nutritional related.  No active bleeding
   -Monitor INR, which is steadily increasing but unclear etiology
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likely the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head, no acute bleed.  Speech and
   swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status.
   Would need PEG in the future, but currently getting feeds from tube
   feeds.
   - Appreciate neurology recs.  Discontinued keppra.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, D/c Tube
   feeds via dopoff

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a medical history of recent subdural hemorrhage (SDH), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She presented with persistently altered mental status, now complicated by hypoxia due to large mucus plugs and subsequent dense right-sided pneumonia. She has been treated empirically with vancomycin, aztreonam, Flagyl, and ciprofloxacin for presumed infection.

The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, labile blood pressure, anemia of unclear etiology, coagulopathy with an increasing INR, recurrent DVTs, and recurrent SDH. There is also evidence of transaminitis and hypernatremia. The patient has been placed on DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/possible pneumonia: The patient's initial hypoxia secondary to large mucus plugs has progressed to a dense right-sided pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not adequately managed.

2. Tachycardia and labile blood pressure: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension are likely related to infection and sepsis from the pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to prevent cardiovascular instability.

3. Anemia: The unclear etiology of blood loss requires further investigation. Continued monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/
   recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental
   status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ ? PNA:  Initial hypoxia secondary to very large mucus plugs
   (X 3) as were evident w/ suctioning, but now the patient has developed
   a dense right sided pneumonia.
   - Treating empirically with vanc/aztreonam/flagyl/cipro for empiric
   coverage per ID
   - humidified air
   - chest pt and frequent suctioning
   - hypotension likely from infection, treating with norepinephrine, will
   not escalate dose
   - arterial line for monitoring
   - continue to monitor oxygen sats
   .
   # AMS:  Pt was much more alert following discontinuation of Keppra and
   dementia medications, however mental status deteriorating given
   worsening infection.
   - EEG did not show evidence of seizure
   - Son believes the patient is much more alert and oriented off keppra,
   but had acute decompensation yesterday in setting of fever and
   tachycardia presumed to be sepsis from pneumonia.  After much
   discussion the decision was made not to escalate care and to make the
   patient DNR/DNI
   .
   #Tachycardia/labile BP:  Likely related to infection, only transiently
   fluid responsive.  Tachycardia improves though not to normal limits
   with morphine.
   -continue morphine PRN
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology of blood loss.  No evidence of RP bleed or
   recurrent SDH.  Received 1 U pRBC. Overnight for ScvO2 of 63
   - d/c heparin and coumadin given recurrent bleeding
   - no evidence of hemolysis
   - guiac stool positive, GI consulted, no EGD/scope indicated at this
   time
   - Follow HCT
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Unclear cause of increase overnight, possibly
   nutritional related.  No active bleeding
   -Monitor INR, which is steadily increasing but unclear etiology
   .
   # Recurrent DVTs: stop coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent
   SDH and hct drop.
   - s/p IVC filter
   .
   # Recurrent SDH: Likely the underlying cause of his poor overall
   functional and mental status.  Per CT head, no acute bleed.  Speech and
   swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status.
   Would need PEG in the future, but currently getting feeds from tube
   feeds.
   - Appreciate neurology recs.  Discontinued keppra.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Ultrasound performed on [**12-9**] was unremarkable.
   - Follow trend for now-appears to be improving
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes-after repeat evaluation, D/c Tube
   feeds via dopoff

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of recent subdural hemorrhage (SDH), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and poor overall functional and mental status. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia secondary to large mucus plugs and subsequent development of a dense right-sided pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia/possible pneumonia: The patient initially had hypoxia due to large mucus plugs, but now has developed a dense right-sided pneumonia. She is being treated empirically with vancomycin, aztreonam, Flagyl, and ciprofloxacin.

2. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's mental status has been deteriorating due to worsening infection. An EEG did not show evidence of seizure, and the son believes the patient is more alert and oriented without Keppra. The decision was made not to escalate care and to make the patient do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI).

3. Tachycardia and labile blood pressure: The patient has a tachycardia that improves with morphine but does not return to normal limits. This is likely related to infection and only transiently fluid responsive.

4. Anemia: The etiology of blood loss is unclear. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) overnight"
