","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging. Her respiratory distress has improved since arrival. The patient has been treated for pneumonia with mixed success. The plan includes obtaining an AM CXR, ABG to assess gradient, NPO, and possibly undergoing bronchoscopy with intubation. Noncontrast CT chest is also planned to evaluate for a lesion and better define the anatomy. Hold ABX as no leukocytosis or fever is present. Chest PT, nebs, and guaifenesin are also part of the plan. Renal dose medications, continuation of home doxercalciferol, bicarb, diltiazem, levothyroxine, and statin are advised. The patient's code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 91%) indicates hypoxemia, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
2. Mucus plugging: The patient's respiratory distress is most likely due to mucus plugging, which can potentially worsen and cause further respiratory compromise if not managed effectively.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for pneumonia, but with mixed success. If"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia most likely secondary to mucus plugging. Her respiratory distress has improved since admission. The patient is currently on 100% oxygen through a non-rebreather mask. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 91%) indicates ongoing hypoxemia. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not corrected.
2. Mucus plugging: The patient's symptoms are most likely related to mucus plugging, which can cause respiratory distress and further complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
3. Acute heart failure: Although less likely, acute heart failure should be considered due to the patient's history of hypertension and the acute onset of symptoms.
4. COPD exacerbation: Another possible cause of the patient's respiratory distress is a COPD exacerbation, especially considering her age and the need for high-flow oxygen.
5. Pulmonary embolism: Although less likely, pulmonary embolism should be considered as a potential cause of the patient's symptoms.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of infections, including pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia, which is likely secondary to mucus plugging. The patient underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation. 

24-hour events include invasive ventilation initiation, arterial line placement, and sputum culture. The patient's allergies include ampicillin, codeine, and tetracyclines. She receives propofol infusion and other ICU medications. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress, which has improved. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/51 mmHg to 171/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 648 mL total in and 618 mL total IV fluids. Blood products were not administered. Urine output is 405 mL in 24 hours. 

The respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CMV ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO"

   had prior bronchs this hospitalization for same.
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress: Bronch yesterday noted thick mucous
   plugging, no evidence of infection (clear cxs, normal WBCs). Question
   is will this mucous plugging recur and cause her lung to collapse
   again? It took 10 days last time around so maybe she is improving.
   Waiting for sedation to wear off in hopes to extubate.
   -          Extubate if can
   -          Consider bronch again today for further mucous suctioning

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CKD stage 4, hypothyroidism, and hypoxia secondary to mucus plugging. She was admitted to the ICU intubated for respiratory distress. The patient has had previous bronchoscopic treatments for similar issues during this hospitalization. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 47.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 79 bpm (range 63-87), blood pressure ranging from 148/55 to 164/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 inspiratory/min, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her EKG shows no peaked T-waves.

Laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 19 mEq/L, hyperphosphatemia with a phosphate level of 7.0 mg/dL, and an elevated BUN level of 283 K/uL. Other labs indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 6.4-6.7 thousand/mm3, slightly decreased platelet count of 83 thousand/mm3, and normal glucose levels ranging from 60-99 mg/dL.

The patient's chest X-ray shows clear lung fields without evidence of infection. She has been started on Mucomyst q6hrs and kayexalate for hyperkalemia. Her renal failure has worsened, and she is awaiting further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of hypoxia and respiratory distress due to mucus plugging.
2. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Progression of renal failure and worsening hyperkalemia.
4. Hypertension and sinus tachycardia requiring further rate control.
5. Hypothyroidism management.
6. Hyperlipidemia management.
7. Potential complications associated with prolonged immobilization and sedation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 4. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia secondary to mucus plugging, which has since improved. The patient also has acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and hypoxemia. 

The patient's current medications include diltiazem for hypertension, doxercalciferol for secondary hyperparathyroidism, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and a statin for hyperlipidemia. She is NPO (nothing by mouth) as she underwent a bronchoscopy today. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated potassium levels (K+ 5.8) and phosphate levels (PO4 7.0 mg/dL), indicating worsening renal failure. Her creatinine level is also elevated at 4.1 mg/dL. Other labs indicate a low white blood cell count (WBC 6.4) and a slightly elevated platelet count (Plt 183 K/uL).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's elevated potassium and phosphate levels, along with the elevated creatinine level, suggest worsening renal function. This could lead to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

2. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and history of mucus pl"

","The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease stage 4. She was admitted to the hospital for hypoxia and respiratory distress, likely secondary to mucus plugging. She has been intubated and is currently in the MICU.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/respiratory distress: The patient had bronchial obstruction due to thick mucus plugging. It is unclear if this will recur and cause lung collapse again. The plan is to wait for sedation to wear off in hopes of extubation.
2. CKD4 & Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels need to be monitored after Kayexalate administration. An EKG should be done, and renally-dose medications should be continued. Home doxercalciferol (for secondary hyperparathyroidism) and bicarbonate should also be continued.
3. Hypertension & sinus tachycardia: These symptoms are occurring in the setting of sedation lightening. Diltiazem 60mg PO QID should be continued, and Lopressor 5 mg (may repeat) should be added for rate control.
4. Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine should be continued at home.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 4, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and recent treatment for an unknown condition. She was transferred to the MICU and intubated for hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging. She has had prior bronchospasms this hospitalization for the same reason. The patient's current vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. Her respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a Vt of 354 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR of 25, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 54. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 428, and Ve of 9.1 L/min. The physical examination reveals that she is intubated, off sedation, withdraws to touch non-focally, and has non-pitting trace edema. Lab results show a WBC count of 6.7 K/uL, Hct of 25.9%, Plt of 291 K/uL, Cr of 3.7 mg/dL, TCO2 of 22 mmol/L, Glucose of 88 mg/dL, and other abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function. Imaging reveals a negative CT head, and urine culture shows yeast. The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxia/respiratory distress, CKD4, hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and other medical conditions. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and malnutrition."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 4, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and previous treatment at another hospital. She was transferred to the MICU and intubated for hypoxia, likely due to mucus plugging. Her respiratory status has stabilized, with decent acid/base status. She has had low-grade fevers and a normal white blood cell count. Her chest X-ray is stable. The goal is to extubate her once sedation wears off.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, which required intubation. Her respiratory status has improved, but she remains on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or mucus plugging.

2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 4: The patient has pre-existing CKD stage 4. In the ICU, her renal function needs to be closely monitored, and medications should be dosed accordingly. Electrolyte imbalances should be watched for, and she should continue with home doxercalciferol for secondary hyperparathyroidism and bicarbonate supplementation.

3. Hypertension & Sinus Tachycardia: The patient experiences hypertension and sinus tachycardia, particularly in the setting of sedation lightening."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypoxia secondary to mucus plugging. She was admitted to the ICU, intubated, and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has altered mental status, likely due to an adverse reaction to ciprofloxacin, which may remain unmetabolized in her system due to severely reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Other medical conditions include hypoxia, respiratory distress, low-grade fevers, and chronic small vessel ischemic changes on head scans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients are at increased risk for stress ulcers due to the body's response to critical illness.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): Prolonged use of central venous catheters increases the risk of CRBSI.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
6. Renal function deterioration: The patient's pre-existing chronic kidney disease may worsen due to factors such as medication toxicity, sepsis, or inadequate"

   Imaging: [**1-1**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis
   (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral
   annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-1-19**], the aortic stenosis may be slightly worse (but still
   only mild).
   [**1-1**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, there is no relevant
   change. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, likely secondary to mucus plugging. The patient is intubated and sedated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 119/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's cardiac function is normal with an ejection fraction of 70%. There is mild aortic stenosis, severe mitral annular calcification, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 226 K/uL. There is a yeast infection in the urine. The patient has a history of allergies to ampicillin, codeine, and tetracyclines. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 83-146 mg/dL. The patient's serum potassium levels are low at 3.3 mEq/L. The patient's Hct has dropped 3 points in the last 24 hours. The patient has an abdominal stent graft visible on chest X-ray.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging, and was intubated. 

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, hypoxia/respiratory distress, fevers, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, hypertension, sinus tachycardia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient had a dystonic reaction to ciprofloxacin, which is believed to remain unmetabolized in her system due to severely reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The sedative propofol was discontinued, and further sedation with midazolam boluses PRN is planned. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable with good acid-base status. Bronchoscopies have noted thick mucus plugging, and she has low-grade fevers with a normal white blood cell count. The chest X-ray is stable. The patient is currently mechanically ventilated, and daily chest X-rays will be done. Nebulizers and mucolytics will be used to manage mucus plugging. 

Further evaluation is needed for infectious workup, including reculture for fevers. Renal dosing of medications will be continued, along with monitoring electrolytes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypoxia, which was likely secondary to mucus plugging. The patient had prior bronchoscopies during this hospitalization for the same reason. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient experienced a dystonic reaction to ciprofloxacin, which is believed to remain unmetabolized in her system due to severely reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Head scans did not show any acute issues, but there may be chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

The patient has altered mental status, low-grade fevers, and normal white blood cell count. Chest X-ray (CXR) is stable. She is not extubatable at this time given her mental status. It is planned to continue mechanical ventilation for now and perform daily CXR. Nebulizations and mucomyst will also be administered.

A yeast infection was found in the urine, and the patient has high-normal WBC count. Further cultures will be done for fevers, and follow-up with outstanding microbiological data is needed.

The patient's creatinine levels are stably high, and she has expressed her wish not to undergo hemodialysis in the past. Renally-dosed medications will be given, and electrolytes will be monitored. Home dox"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of withdrawing arms bilaterally and almost posturing, raising concerns for a neurologic response to Cipro. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and hypoxemia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been in the ICU for an unknown duration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient's withdrawal of arms bilaterally and posturing may indicate a neurological response to Cipro. This suggests the possibility of central nervous system involvement and potential complications such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.

2. Infection: The presence of yeast in the urine culture indicates a possible fungal infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of systemic infection or sepsis, and appropriate antifungal treatment should be initiated.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although the note states that the patient does not have ARDS, it is crucial to closely monitor his respiratory status due to the risk of developing ARDS, especially considering his acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation.

4. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure, which may lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for ongoing renal support.

5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's echo results show mild AS (aortic stenosis) and severe mitral annular calcification, along"

   85 F with HTN, CKD stage 4 s/p treatment of [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU and
   intubated for hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging. Has had
   prior bronchs this hospitalization for same.
   # Altered mental status: Believed to have had dystonic reaction to
   cipro which was started on Wednesday and discontinued Thursday. Given
   renal insufficiency, cipro is likely to remain unmetabolized in her
   system, given severely reduced GFR. Head scans negative for acute
   issues, although may have chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
   Propofol was discontinued and further sedation with Midazolam boluses
   PRN (was agitated with RN care overnight but calmer this morning)
   - Continue sedation with midazolam boluses PRN
   - C/w holding fluoroquinolones
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress: Respiratory status stable with good
   acid/base status. Bronchs have noted thick mucous plugging. Has low
   grade fevers but normal WBC count that continues to trend down. CXR
   stable. Per discussion by attending with sons, yesterday, family feels
   patient would wish to have a tracheostomy if unable to extubate
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation for now
 will try pressure
   support later today if mental status continues to improve.
   - Daily CXR
   - Nebs, mucomyst
   # Fevers: Low-grade, infectious workup unrevealing besides yeast in
   urine, which has been treated. CXR stable. WBC normal
   - Will reculture for further fevers
   - F/u outstanding micro data
   #. CKD4: Creatinine stably high. Patient has voiced wishes to not have
   hemodialysis in the past
   - Renally-dose medications
   - Monitor electrolytes
   - Continue bicarb
   - Continue doxercalciferol (for secondary hyperparathyroidism, if can
   find means to administer to intubated patient)
   #. Hypertension & sinus tachycardia: Occurring in setting of sedation
   lightening
   -Continue diltiazem 60mg PO QID.
   - Add Labetolol PRN for further rate & pressure control, goal SBP < 160

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging, and intubated. She has had prior bronchoscopies during this hospitalization for the same reason. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to a dystonic reaction to ciprofloxacin, which was discontinued. Renal insufficiency is present, and head scans show chronic small vessel ischemic changes but no acute issues. Propofol was discontinued, and sedation with midazolam boluses PRN is being continued.

The patient's respiratory status is stable with good acid/base status, but bronchoscopies have noted thick mucous plugging. Low-grade fevers are present, but the WBC count is normal and trending down. A chest X-ray (CXR) is stable. The family has expressed a desire for a tracheostomy if the patient cannot be extubated. Mechanical ventilation will be continued for now, with pressure support to be tried later today if the mental status continues to improve.

Infectious workup is unrevealing except for yeast in the urine, which has been treated. A reculture will be done for further fevers, and follow-up with outstanding microbiological data is pending. The patient's creatinine levels are stably"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 F with HTN, CKD stage 4 s/p treatment of [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU and
   intubated for hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging. Has had
   prior bronchs this hospitalization for same.
   # Altered mental status: Believed to have had dystonic reaction to
   cipro which was started on Wednesday and discontinued Thursday. Given
   renal insufficiency, cipro is likely to remain unmetabolized in her
   system, given severely reduced GFR. Head scans negative for acute
   issues, although may have chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
   Propofol was discontinued and further sedation with Midazolam boluses
   PRN (was agitated with RN care overnight but calmer this morning)
   - Continue sedation with midazolam boluses PRN
   - C/w holding fluoroquinolones
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress: Respiratory status stable with good
   acid/base status. Bronchs have noted thick mucous plugging. Has low
   grade fevers but normal WBC count that continues to trend down. CXR
   stable. Per discussion by attending with sons, yesterday, family feels
   patient would wish to have a tracheostomy if unable to extubate
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation for now
 will try pressure
   support later today if mental status continues to improve.
   - Daily CXR
   - Nebs, mucomyst
   # Fevers: Low-grade, infectious workup unrevealing besides yeast in
   urine, which has been treated. CXR stable. WBC normal
   - Will reculture for further fevers
   - F/u outstanding micro data
   #. CKD4: Creatinine stably high. Patient has voiced wishes to not have
   hemodialysis in the past
   - Renally-dose medications
   - Monitor electrolytes
   - Continue bicarb
   - Continue doxercalciferol (for secondary hyperparathyroidism, if can
   find means to administer to intubated patient)
   #. Hypertension & sinus tachycardia: Occurring in setting of sedation
   lightening
   -Continue diltiazem 60mg PO QID.
   - Add Labetolol PRN for further rate & pressure control, goal SBP < 160
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine.
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after being treated for respiratory failure, likely due to mucus plugging. She also has altered mental status, believed to be a dystonic reaction to ciprofloxacin, which was discontinued. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), a heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation. 

Her lab results show renal failure with a creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 26.0 mL/min. She also has an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 48 mg/dL and potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L. Other lab abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), low albumin level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's current medications include renal-dose medications, doxercalciferol for secondary hyperparathyroidism, diltiazem for hypertension, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and a statin for hyperlipid"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient had been treated at another hospital and was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/66 mmHg to 165/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's mental status has improved, particularly when speaking in the left ear where the hearing aid is present. 

The patient is currently receiving pressure support ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.4, and the set tidal volume (Vt) is 450 mL. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 23 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Pplat) is 19 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 10 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 358, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10 cmH2O.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment of acute renal failure and subsequently developed respiratory distress, leading to intubation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 148/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination revealed altered mental status, squeezing hands, opening eyes, clear lungs, and no edema. Laboratory results showed elevated creatinine levels and other abnormalities, including low white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose, and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved compared to previous assessments. Continue sedation with midazolam boluses as needed.
2. Hypoxia/respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status remains stable, with normal chest X-ray findings. Continue aggressive pulmonary toilet, trial of spontaneous breathing with pressure support, and consider extubation this afternoon. If extubation fails, consider tracheostomy.
3. Fevers: The patient has low-grade fevers, but infectious workup has been unrevealing except for yeast in"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease stage 4, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has shown improvement in mental status over the past 24 hours. The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers and is being treated for a yeast infection in the urine. He has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and is currently on multiple medications including heparin, midazolam, fentanyl, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/49 to 165/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated creatinine levels and abnormal electrolytes. The plan includes continuing aggressive pulmonary toilet, trial of extubation this afternoon, and consideration for tracheostomy if extubation fails. The patient's family prefers tracheostomy if extubation is unsuccessful. Daily chest X-rays will be obtained, and further infectious workup will be done. Renal-dose medications will be monitored, and doxercalciferol will be restarted for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Diltiazem will be continued for hypertension and sinus tachycardia, and labetal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and has received various treatments and medications during their stay in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs indicate a slightly elevated temperature, stable heart rate, fluctuating blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently at 100%, indicating proper oxygenation.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory support is being delivered through an endotracheal tube, and the mode of ventilation is set to mandatory minute volume/pressure support/automatic flow (MMV/PSV/AutoFlow).

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,478 mL (including 428 mL of intravenous fluids) and an output of 1,040 mL (including 305 mL of urine). The net fluid balance is 438 mL positive.

Laboratory results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, glucose, and other lab values. These abnormalities suggest possible infections, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of acute respiratory failure, unclear mental status, and renal insufficiency. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of mental status improvement, tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV), and no new changes in allergies. The patient has a history of renal insufficiency, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), low-grade fever, poor mental status, and decreased lung sounds bilaterally. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a supple neck, regular heart rhythm, decreased breath sounds, benign abdomen, and no edema. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the chest X-ray shows left lower lobe volume loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that could arise for this patient include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's mental status has improved, and they have tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) since yesterday. The patient has allergies to ampicillin, codeine, and tetracyclines. The last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin at 06:00 PM and fluconazole at 05:25 AM. The patient is receiving various infusions including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), midazolam (versed), and fentanyl. Other medications include NovaSource Renal (full) for nutrition and a PICC line for vascular access.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the improvement in mental status.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8 C (100.1 F)
- Heart rate: 85 bpm (normal range: 65-95 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 149/64 mmHg (normal range: 117/49-165/73 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (normal range: 13-30 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) is 25 breaths per minute.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,478 mL, including 428 mL of total in, 598 mL of TF, and 370 mL of IVF. The output includes 1,040 mL of total out, with 305 mL of urine output. The calculated fluid balance is 438 mL.

Laboratory results show stable renal function with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 222 K/uL and creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL. The white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal limits at 7.0-7.4 K/uL. The platelet count (Plt) is slightly low at 22 K/uL. Other lab values include sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), carbon dioxide (CO2), glucose, and liver function tests. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 358 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg. The respiratory system is stable with no signs of infection on the chest X-ray (CXR). However, there are stable effusions and left lower lobe (LLL) atelectasis.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory failure has improved, and they have tolerated PSV. The plan is to continue with SBT (spontaneous breathing trial) as tolerated. The patient also has a low-grade fever, which will be checked with sputum cultures. Mental status has improved, and supportive care will be continued. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, arterial line, PICC line, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which has improved with the use of PSV. However, there is a risk of recurring respiratory failure if the patient does not tolerate SBT or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of a low-grade fever and LLL atelectasis raises concerns about potential infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis. Monitoring for worsening fever and respiratory symptoms is important.
3. Renal Insufficiency: Although the patient's renal function is currently stable, there is a risk of renal insufficiency due to decreased renal perfusion or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent further fluid accumulation and potential complications like pulmonary edema.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, such as DVT or pulmonary embolism, due to prolonged immobil"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and hypoxemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular chest X-rays should be done to detect any signs of pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots. Regular assessment for signs of DVT and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections. Regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, along with proper infection control practices, can help prevent and detect these infections.
4. Delirium: Despite the altered mental status not being classified as delirium, the patient's mental status should be closely monitored due to the risk of developing delirium in the ICU setting. Early recognition and management of delirium can improve patient outcomes.
5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload or underload, which can affect renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease stage 4, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and likely mucus plugging. She has been extubated but has expressed her desire not to be reintubated. Her mental status has improved, but she still requires close monitoring. She has low-grade fevers and a normal white blood cell count. There is a concern for recurrent plugging, given her hypoxic episodes and previous bronchoscopy findings. She is currently on an aggressive pulmonary toilet regimen and non-invasive ventilation as needed. Her creatinine levels have improved but remain high, within the range of baseline. She has shown reluctance about hemodialysis in the past. Other medical issues include hypertension, sinus tachycardia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: Due to mucus plugging and recurrent hypoxic episodes, there is a potential for respiratory distress leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and possible need for reintubation.
2. Infection: Despite low-grade fevers and normal WBC count, the presence of yeast in the urine suggests a possible infection that needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.
3. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: With renal insufficiency, careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance is necessary to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of CKD stage 4, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and likely mucus plugging. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His current condition includes altered mental status, hypoxia, respiratory distress, low-grade fevers, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 61-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/54-181/169 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 22-37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels and a decreased hematocrit. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and history of bronchial hygiene procedures suggest a potential risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to high airway pressures from mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and sinus tachycardia may indicate underlying cardiac issues. The use of diltiazem and labetalol is aimed at controlling blood pressure and heart rate, respectively.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's CKD stage 4 and elevated creatinine levels suggest a risk for further deterioration in renal function. Close monitoring of electrolytes and consideration of renal-dose medications are important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease who was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging. The patient self-extubated yesterday and has decreasing oxygenation with a whiteout of the left lung on chest X-ray. The patient is DNR/DNI and has expressed a reluctance about hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient's oxygenation is worsening despite non-invasive ventilation and aggressive pulmonary toilet. The patient has declined reintubation or deep suctioning. Considering her clinical picture, a hospice/palliative care approach may be necessary.
2. CKD4: The patient's creatinine levels are within the range of baseline, but further monitoring of electrolytes and renal-dose medications is required. The patient has also expressed reluctance about hemodialysis.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved, but there is a prolonged clearance of ciprofloxacin. Avoidance of sedation and monitoring of mental status are recommended.
4. Hypertension & Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are stable, but further rate and pressure control are needed. Diltiazem 60mg PO QID and labetalol PRN can be continued, with a goal of keeping systolic blood pressure below 160.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease stage 4 who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia. She was intubated due to mucus plugging and treated with antibiotics. The patient's altered mental status has improved, and she is now extubated. However, she does not want to be re-intubated. Her respiratory status is stable, and her chest X-ray (CXR) is normal. She continues to experience low-grade fevers, but her white blood cell count is normal. There are concerns about recurrent plugging, given her previous bronchoscopy findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of mucus plugging and previous bronchoscopy findings suggest a risk of recurrent respiratory plugging. This can lead to hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has had low-grade fevers and yeast in her urine. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and treat any infections promptly.
3. Renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease stage 4, and her creatinine levels are high. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. It is important to monitor her thyroid function and adjust medication as needed.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is on a statin for hyperlipidemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient had an unplanned extubation in the morning and was not reintubated due to the patient's preference. The initial post-extubation ABG showed a PO2 of 67. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, using 80% FiO2, and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 136/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1,786 mL since 29 AM. The patient's lab results indicate acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient is receiving IV lasix for hypoxia and prophylactic heparin. The patient's code status is full code. The patient's disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to increased fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease stage 4 who was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, likely due to mucus plugging. She self-extubated yesterday and is now experiencing decreasing oxygenation. The patient has expressed her desire to be DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate). She has allergies to ampicillin, codeine, and tetracyclines. The patient is receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and others. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 136/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 80%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for hypoxia. Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's physical examination reveals an alert and oriented mental status, normal heart sounds, soft and non-distended abdomen, and no edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygenation has been decreasing since she self-extubated, indicating a potential respiratory distress. Despite being offered noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), the patient prefers a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of CKD stage 4 and was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging. The patient self-extubated yesterday and is now experiencing decreasing oxygenation. The patient's condition has worsened, and there is a complete collapse of the left lung with extensive shift of the mediastinum and the heart to the left. The right lung shows minimally improved ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 86%. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which can progress to respiratory failure if not treated appropriately.
3. Mucus Plugging: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to mucus plugging. If not managed effectively, mucus plugging can further obstruct the airways and worsen respiratory function.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status, along with the presence of fever and cough, raises the concern for pneumonia. Infection can complicate the patient's condition and lead to sepsis.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The extensive shift of the mediastinum and the heart to the left due to the collapse of the left lung may cause cardiovascular complications such as cardiac tamponade or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure (stage 4), hypertension, altered mental status, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and is currently in the ICU. 

The patient's recent events include complaining of right-sided chest pain, which was reproducible but with normal EKG findings and clear chest x-ray. The patient was given CRF (oxygen hunger) and started on morphine 1-3mg q1hour PRN with good effect. The patient continued to be agitated, removing the facemask throughout the day, desaturating to ~85% and refusing deep suctioning. Attempted facetent was made in the evening.

The patient has allergies to ampicillin, codeine, and tetracyclines. The patient is currently on several medications including morphine sulfate, midazolam (versed), fentanyl, and other ICU medications. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission except for dyspnea.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7C (98.1F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 176/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%. The patient's height is 63 inches with a total fluid intake of 240 mL and output of 68 mL, resulting"
