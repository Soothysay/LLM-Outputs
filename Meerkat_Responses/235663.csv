   24 Hour Events:
   Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is a 37 yoM w/ HepC cirrhosis 2/2 blood transfusions
   as a child related to ALL, who was admitted on [**2124-11-27**] for
   encephalopathy.  He has had a hospital course complicated by hepatic
   hydrothorax (s/p tap on [**11-28**], transudative effusion, cx neg), newly dx
   portal vein thrombosis (not anticoagulated b/c stool is guaiac
   positive), CBD stone (s/p ERCP on [**2124-11-30**] w/o improvement in sx),
   hypercalcemia, panhypopit, and dermatophyte infection of the leg (blood
   cultures negative).  He is being transferred from the [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
   service to the MICU for worsening mental status.
   .
   Per the floor team, the patient was conversant and alert (though sleepy
   most of the day) on [**2124-12-3**].  The morning of [**2124-12-4**] he was found
   somnolent on rounds with little improvement throughout the day.  He was
   considered unsafe to take PO's, and there was concern for airway
   protection with delta MS, prompting ICU transfer.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of HepC cirrhosis, who is currently admitted to the ICU for encephalopathy. He has had a hospital course complicated by hepatic hydrothorax, portal vein thrombosis, CBD stone, hypercalcemia, panhypopituitarism, and dermatophyte infection of the leg. He is being transferred from the [Doctor Last Name]-[Doctor Last Name] service to the MICU for worsening mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delta MS (Multifactorial Mental Status changes): The patient's lethargy and somnolent behavior could be due to a combination of factors including hypercalcemia and hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and the presence of fetor hepaticus suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. Aggressive lactulose and rifaximin therapy has been initiated.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level of 11.7 mg/dL indicates hypercalcemia. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline and lasix is being given to treat hypercalcemia. Calcitonin has also been ordered per renal recommendations. Cinacalcet has been started at 30 mg QOD.
4. Coagulopathy and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo M with HCV/cirrhosis complicated by ascites, encephalopathy,
   hepatic hydrothorax and varices admitted with AMS and found to be
   hypercalcemic.  Transferred for observation in the setting of
   encephalopathy
   1.) Encephalopathy:  Seems likely secondary to both hepatic
   encephalopathy with perhaps small contribution of hypercalcemia.  No
   clear signs of infection at present.
     -Continue lactulose/rifaximin
     -Aggressive hydration overnight did not significantly change calcium
   level.  Cannot get cinacalcet via NGT.  Discuss with endocrine re:
   ?bisphosphonate.
     -Aspiration precautions
    2.) Cirrhosis:  Seemingly decompensated at present given increased
   bili's and MS.  Possibly due to acute portal vein thrombosis
     -Lactulose/rifaximin as above
     -Per GI, preference is to avoid anticoagulation for portal vein
   thrombosis given significant coagulopathy.
    3.) Hypercalcemia:  PTH inappropriately elevated for hypercalcemia.
   Suggests primary hyperparathyroidism
     -Treatment of hypercalcemia as above
     -Once deemed stable, would need sestamibi scan for eval
    4.)  Skin infection: Felt to be fungal based on biopsies.  Appreciate
   ID input.
     -will continue anti-fungal coverage with caspofungin for now
    5.) Hepatic hydrothorax:
     -Will avoid serial taps
     -Will try to manage volume status with diuretics
    6) Coagulopathy
     -elevated PT, low platelets.  No evidence of bleeding at present.
   7) Panhypopit
     -Continue usual replacement doses

   Disposition :ICU
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis, presenting with ascites, encephalopathy, hepatic hydrothorax, and varices. He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and is currently being observed in the ICU for encephalopathy.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, possibly with a small contribution from hypercalcemia. Treatment includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin. Aggressive hydration did not significantly change the calcium level, and cinacalcet cannot be administered through the NGT. Discussing the use of bisphosphonates with an endocrinologist is recommended. Aspiration precautions should also be taken.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis appears to be decompensated, as indicated by increased bilirubin levels and mental status changes. This may be due to acute portal vein thrombosis. Treatment includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin. Per GI, avoiding anticoagulation for portal vein thrombosis is advised due to significant coagulopathy.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia with an inappropriately elevated PTH level, suggesting primary hyperparathyroidism. Treatment should focus on managing hypercalcemia and planning for a sestamibi scan once the patient is deemed stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo M with HCV/cirrhosis complicated by ascites, encephalopathy,
   hepatic hydrothorax and varices admitted with AMS and found to be
   hypercalcemic.  Transferred for observation in the setting of
   encephalopathy
   1.) Encephalopathy:  Seems likely secondary to both hepatic
   encephalopathy with perhaps small contribution of hypercalcemia.  No
   clear signs of infection at present.
     -Continue lactulose/rifaximin
     -Aggressive hydration overnight did not significantly change calcium
   level.  Cannot get cinacalcet via NGT.  Discuss with endocrine re:
   ?bisphosphonate.
     -Aspiration precautions
    2.) Cirrhosis:  Seemingly decompensated at present given increased
   bili's and MS.  Possibly due to acute portal vein thrombosis
     -Lactulose/rifaximin as above
     -Per GI, preference is to avoid anticoagulation for portal vein
   thrombosis given significant coagulopathy.
    3.) Hypercalcemia:  PTH inappropriately elevated for hypercalcemia.
   Suggests primary hyperparathyroidism
     -Treatment of hypercalcemia as above
     -Once deemed stable, would need sestamibi scan for eval
    4.)  Skin infection: Felt to be fungal based on biopsies.  Appreciate
   ID input.
     -will continue anti-fungal coverage with caspofungin for now
    5.) Hepatic hydrothorax:
     -Will avoid serial taps
     -Will try to manage volume status with diuretics
    6) Coagulopathy
     -elevated PT, low platelets.  No evidence of bleeding at present.
   7) Panhypopit
     -Continue usual replacement doses

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of HCV and cirrhosis, presenting with ascites, encephalopathy, hepatic hydrothorax, and varices. He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and found to be hypercalcemic. The patient is currently in the ICU for observation due to encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, with a small contribution from hypercalcemia. The plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin, as well as aggressive hydration. Aspiration precautions are also necessary.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis appears to be decompensated, possibly due to acute portal vein thrombosis. Treatment involves continuing lactulose and rifaximin, and avoiding anticoagulation for portal vein thrombosis due to significant coagulopathy.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia with an inappropriately elevated PTH, suggesting primary hyperparathyroidism. Treatment includes managing hypercalcemia as mentioned above, and considering a sestamibi scan for evaluation once the patient is deemed stable.
4. Skin infection: The patient has a fungal skin infection based on biopsies. Anti-fungal coverage with caspofungin will be continued.

   requirement as prior).  Neuro exam non-focal.  No evidnece for
   infectious etiologies, though cultures still pending.  Improvement
   overnight with Ox2, but still not at baseline.  No concern though for
   poor airway protection currently, though not ready to takePO
   medications

   calcitonin
   -- f/u vit d levels from [**2124-12-3**]; decision on whether to start
   bisphosphonates depends on levels per endocrine
   (#) COAGULOPATHY, THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Heme attg following; c/w ESLD more

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a medical history including Hepatitis C cirrhosis/ESLD, hypercalcemia, and panhypopituitarism. He was admitted to the ICU for lethargy and altered mental status (MS). The patient has a large hepatic hydrothorax, but no respiratory distress and is oxygenating well on 4 liters of nasal cannula. Neurological examination is non-focal, and there is no evidence of infectious etiologies, though cultures are still pending. The patient showed improvement overnight with oxygen therapy but is still not at baseline. There are no concerns for poor airway protection currently, but the patient is not ready to take oral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DELTA MS: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, with hypercalcemia and hepatic encephalopathy being the most likely contributors. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any further deterioration in mental status.
2. ESLD/Hep C Cirrhosis: The patient has ESLD with a MELD score of 35. He is off the transplant list while critically ill. There is no improvement in total bilirubin and synthetic function post-ERCP, and he also has portal vein thrombosis but is coagulopathic, so he is not on anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a medical history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis/ESLD, hypercalcemia, and panhypopituitarism. He was admitted to the ICU for lethargy and delta MS. The patient's current condition includes large hepatic hydrothorax, hypercalcemia, and neurologic changes. He is critically ill but appears to be improving with oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has decreased breath sounds on the right side and crackles at the bases, indicating possible respiratory distress. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygen saturation levels and respiratory status is necessary. If the patient develops worsening respiratory distress or shows signs of poor airway protection, intubation may be required.

2. Hepatic Hydrothorax: The patient has a large hepatic hydrothorax, which can lead to respiratory compromise if it progresses. Regular monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and follow-up chest X-rays are recommended.

3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which can cause various complications such as renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurologic changes. Aggressive hydration with normal saline and diuretics may be necessary to correct the hypercalcemia.

4. Panhypopituitarism: The patient has panhypopituitarism, which requires hormonal replacement therapy. The patient is currently receiving levothyroxine, dexameth"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a medical history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis/ESLD, hypercalcemia, and panhypopituitarism. He was admitted to the ICU for lethargy/delta mental status change. The patient's current condition includes large hepatic hydrothorax, no respiratory distress, and oxygen saturation on 4 liters nasal cannula. Neurological examination shows him to be arousable but somnolent, falls asleep immediately after being aroused, and does not answer questions. There are no signs of infection based on cultures still pending. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/68 mmHg to 136/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has trace lower extremity edema, jaundice, scattered erosions, and eschars on the lower extremities. Lab results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), elevated total bilirubin, high calcium levels, and decreased white blood cell count. The patient is currently on multiple medications including lactulose, rifaximin, caspofungin, ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine, dexamethasone, testosterone patch, and cinacalcet.

   comfortable further treatment on the floor.
","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a medical history of HepC cirrhosis/ESLD, hypercalcemia, and panhypopituitarism. He was admitted to the ICU for lethargy and delta MS. The patient has a large hepatic hydrothorax, but no evidence of respiratory distress. He is currently on 4LNC and his neuro exam is non-focal. There is no evidence of infectious etiologies, although cultures are still pending. The patient showed improvement overnight with O2 but is still not at baseline. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a large hepatic hydrothorax and requires supplemental oxygen. If he develops respiratory distress, it could lead to worsening of his condition and potentially require intubation for airway protection.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's lethargy may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. This condition can cause altered mental status and may require treatment with lactulose and rifaximin.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which can contribute to lethargy and may require aggressive management with free water boluses and intravenous fluids.
4. Panhypopituitarism: The patient has panhypopituitarism, requiring hormonal replacement therapy with levothyroxine, dexamethasone, and testosterone patch"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of HCV and cirrhosis, presenting with complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, hepatic hydrothorax, and varices. He was admitted with altered mental status and hypercalcemia, and is currently being observed in the ICU for encephalopathy. The patient has a low platelet count and coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of infection. His liver function tests indicate decompensated cirrhosis, possibly due to acute portal vein thrombosis. The patient also has hypercalcemia with an inappropriately elevated PTH level, suggesting primary hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, there is a suspicion of a fungal skin infection, and the patient is being treated with caspofungin. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and he may require intubation if it worsens. The plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin, considering a diagnostic paracentesis to rule out SBP, avoiding anticoagulation for portal vein thrombosis, and managing volume status with diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy could potentially worsen, leading to further cognitive impairment and possible progression to coma.
2. Infection: The patient's low platelet count and coagulopathy increase the risk of infection, particularly spontaneous bacterial periton"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a medical history including HepC cirrhosis/ESLD, hypercalcemia, and panhypopituitarism. He was admitted to the ICU for lethargy/delta mental status change. The patient has a large hepatic hydrothorax but no respiratory distress, and he is oxygenating well on 4 liters nasal cannula. Neurological examination is non-focal. The patient's mental status is worsening, likely due to hypercalcemia and hepatic encephalopathy. His goals of care have shifted towards comfort measures only. The patient's synthetic liver function is critically ill, with an INR of 4.9 and platelets in the 20s.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's worsening mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication of liver cirrhosis. This condition can cause confusion, altered levels of consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.

2. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels can contribute to neurological symptoms, including mental status changes and lethargy. It is important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.

3. Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an elevated INR and low platelet count. This increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and appropriate management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including hepatic encephalopathy, hypercalcemia, and panhypopituitarism. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to lethargy and progressive mental status changes. Despite treatment of metabolic derangements and hepatic encephalopathy, the patient's mental status has continued to deteriorate. Goals of care have been changed to comfort measures only (DNR/DNI) due to the patient's critical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and confusion. It is important to continue lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.
2. Deep dermatophyte infection of the lower extremities: The patient has a fungal infection in the lower extremities, for which caspofungin is being administered. Further ID recommendations should be followed.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has high calcium levels, likely due to primary hyperparathyroidism. Aggressive fluid therapy has been given, and cinacalcet is being continued. Further management of hypercalcemia may involve holding aggressive fluid therapy and monitoring calcium levels.
4. Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters and low platelet count. These findings may indicate"
