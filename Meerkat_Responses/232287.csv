   Assessment and Plan
   Obtundation/coma:   Unclear cause.  No acute CNS bleed evident or
   evidence of trauma.  Tox screen was negative.   Will perform LP
   today to r/o meningitis.
   Coagulopathy:  may be related to cirrhosis.  Will give FFP and Vitamin
   K for LP.  Will try to get baseline values from OSH.
   respiratory failure:  Due to obtundation and acidosis
   metabolic acidosis:  likely due to renal failure
   Fever: also having diarrhea.  Will get LP.  Get abdominal U/S to check
   for ascites.
   renal failure:  urine lytes consistent with prerenal process.
   Agressive IVF can give bicarb with D5 due to acidosis.
   hypernatremia:  free water repletion
   melena:  tarry black guaiac positive stools.  EGD at OSH - duodenitis
   in prior hospitalization.   Will get GI consult, and give
   blood/products for
   coagulopathy
   thrombocytopenia:  likely due to cirrhosis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of polysubstance abuse who was found unresponsive by his roommate. He has multiple needles around him and was taken to the emergency department (ED) where he was intubated due to respiratory failure. A negative head CT ruled out any acute CNS bleed or trauma. His INR is elevated at 3, indicating coagulopathy. He also has acute renal failure and received 4 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) in the ED. Overnight, he has been tachycardic.

The patient has several medical conditions and allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was cefipime and metronidazole. He is currently receiving propofol infusion, fentanyl, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). He has a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, stasis dermatitis, and a recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis and hematoma due to trauma from a fall. During that hospital course, he had a work-up for abdominal pain, which ruled out pancreatitis but showed an abnormal duodenal finding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed severe duodenitis and small esophageal varices.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 143 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 559 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 22 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 1243.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds inadequately. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count of 45 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 3.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 201 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. Other labs indicate coagulopathy with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), as well as elevated lactic acid levels.

The assessment and plan include obtundation/coma with unclear cause, coagulopathy possibly related to cirrhosis, respiratory failure due to obtundation and acidosis, metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure, fever with diarrhea, renal failure with urine electrolytes consistent with a prerenal process, hypernatremia, melena, thrombocytopenia, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening renal failure, infections such as meningitis or sepsis, bleeding due to coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of polysubstance abuse. He was found unresponsive by his roommate and taken to the emergency department (ED) where he was intubated due to respiratory failure. Initial tests showed coagulopathy with an elevated INR of 3 and acute renal failure. The patient received 4 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) in the ED and had a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. A lumbar puncture (LP) was deferred due to coagulopathy. In the MICU, the patient has been tachycardic and received 1 liter of IVF overnight. 

Medical Complications:
1. Obtundation/Coma: The patient is in a coma-like state with unclear cause. There is no evidence of acute CNS bleed or trauma, and the tox screen was negative. A LP will be performed today to rule out meningitis.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient may have coagulopathy related to cirrhosis. FFP and Vitamin K will be given for the LP, and baseline values from OSH will be obtained.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to obtundation and acidosis.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure.
5. Fever: The patient also has diarrhea. A LP will be done, and an abdominal ultrasound (US"
