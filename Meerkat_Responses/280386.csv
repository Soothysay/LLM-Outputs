","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (M/W/F), and a history of bladder cancer. He presented to the hospital with fever, cough, and decreased oral intake, and radiographic evidence of multifocal pneumonia on chest X-ray.

Based on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings, the patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia. The treatment plan includes initiating influenza surveillance, obtaining sputum and blood cultures, continuing vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and tamiflu, checking urine Legionella if possible, monitoring oxygen requirements and saturation levels, sending c diff, and adding oral vanc or flagyl if diarrhea develops. An MRSA screen is also planned.

The patient is scheduled for hemodialysis today, with access via left upper extremity fistula. Renal recommendations are appreciated, and medications will be dosed accordingly. If the patient does not undergo hemodialysis, the physician should check potassium levels.

The patient's blood pressure has remained normotensive to moderately hypertensive. Metoprolol will be continued, while lisinopril/amlodipine/minoxidil will be held temporarily due to the active infectious process. Short-acting antihypertensive (captopril 50mg q8hrs) will be restarted.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with pneumonia and respiratory distress. The respiratory distress is attributed to a lung infection, likely bacterial. The patient has been intubated and placed on supplemental oxygen. Antimicrobials have been continued to treat the infection. 

The patient also has hypovolemia and is receiving resuscitation fluids to maintain adequate hydration. He is currently undergoing hemodialysis due to renal failure. The patient's code status is full code, and the family has accepted intubation and cardiovascular life support.

Other medical conditions mentioned in the note include Alzheimer's dementia and hypertension. The patient is being managed with ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and venous thromboembolism (DVT) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress if the lung infection progresses or if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is also a risk of further deterioration in renal function if the hemodialysis is not effective. The patient's hypotension needs to be closely monitored, and if it does not improve with fluid resuscitation, additional interventions may be required."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, prior infections (MSSA and Pseudomonal bacteremia), dementia, and advanced bladder cancer. He presents with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and radiographic infiltrates. The physical examination reveals bilateral basilar crackles and bronchial breath sounds in the right axilla. The chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and opacities in the right mid lung zone and left base.

Assessment:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with pneumonia and respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes influenza, health-care-associated, and community-acquired pneumonia. Empiric coverage for MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypical pathogens will be planned. Influenza DFA and droplet precautions will be implemented. Support with oxygen is ongoing, and if the patient's condition worsens, intubation rather than noninvasive mechanical ventilation may be necessary due to the underlying pneumonia. Peripheral access is adequate, and there is no indication for arterial access. The patient's code status is full code, and the family accepts intubation and central venous line placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's respiratory distress and the presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of progressing to respiratory failure. Supportive measures such as oxygen supplementation and possibly mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Infection:"

   Assessment and Plan
    I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 10720**] with the ICU team.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6796**]
   note from today reflects my input.  [**Age over 90 382**] year-old man with complex past
   history now presents with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and
   radiographic infiltrates.  PMH esp notable for ESRD on HD, prior hx of
   MSSA and Pseudomonal bacteremia, dementia, and advanced bladder
   cancer.  Tm 102 in ED, 96% on high flow, RR 25.  Heart is regular but
   distant.  Basilar crackles bilaterally, with some bronchial breath
   sounds right axilla.  Labs, meds, FH, SH, All, ROS reviewed.  CXR shows
   cardiomegaly and convincing opacities in the right mid lung zone and
   left base.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**]-year-old man with pneumonia and respiratory distress.  Influenza,
   health-care-associated, and community-acquired pneumonia are all in
   differential.  We will plan
          Cover for MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypicals
          Influenza DFA and droplet precautions
          Empiric oseltamivir
          Support with oxygen.  If progresses, would likely need to
   move to intubation rather than NIMV given the fact that underlying
   etiology is pneumonia.
   At present, peripheral access is adequate and there is no indication
   for arterial access.
   He is full code, and per family would accept intubation and CVL.

   (M/W/F) and h/o bladder CA presented to [**Hospital1 54**] ED with fever, cough, and
   decreased oral intake.

   # Fever/hypoxia:  Concerning for PNA.  Does not appear to be in heart
   failure.  History and presentation not consistent with PE.
   - r/o Flu swab
   - droplet precautions
   - f/u sputum/BCX
   - continue vanc and tamiflu
   - switch levofloxacin to cefepime given h/o pseudomonas
   - will add azithromycin
   - check urine legionella
   - ABG
   - wean off of nonrebreather
   - send c diff and add oral vanc or flagyl if her developes diarrhea
   .
   # ESRD/HD:
   - apprecieate renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart lisinopril/amlodipine/minoxidil in AM if patient is
   hemodynamically stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old man with a complex medical history, including ESRD on HD, prior MSSA and Pseudomonal bacteremia, dementia, and advanced bladder cancer.
- He presented to the hospital with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and radiographic infiltrates.
- His current condition includes a distant heart sound, bilateral crackles, and bronchial breath sounds in the right axilla.
- Labs, medications, family history, social history, allergies, and review of systems were reviewed.
- Chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and opacities in the right mid lung zone and left base.
- Assessment and plan include covering for MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypical pneumonia, influenza DFA, droplet precautions, empiric oseltamivir, and oxygen support.
- The patient is full code and would accept intubation and CVL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the presence of fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and radiographic infiltrates, pneumonia is a potential complication. The patient's underlying etiology of pneumonia increases the risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and bilateral crackles suggest the possibility of ARDS, which is a severe complication characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs.
3. Septic Shock: With the patient's history of ESR"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD), and bladder cancer. He presented to the hospital with fever, cough, and decreased oral intake, and radiographic evidence of multifocal pneumonia (PNA) on chest X-ray.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Multifocal PNA: The patient has symptoms consistent with multifocal pneumonia, which is confirmed by radiographic evidence on the chest X-ray. This indicates a respiratory infection that may require further treatment and monitoring.

2. ESRD/HD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis three times a week. It is important to monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly. Daily vancomycin levels should be checked, and phosphate binders should be administered with meals. The patient's electrolyte levels should also be closely monitored.

3. HTN: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol and captopril. Lisinopril/amlodipine/minoxidil should be held temporarily due to the active infectious process, but captopril can be continued.

4. Agitation/Alzheimer's Dementia: The patient is experiencing agitation, which can be managed with his home medications and Zydis PRN for agitation, up to a maximum daily dose of 20mg. There is no QTc prolongation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bladder cancer. He presented to the hospital with fever, cough, and decreased oral intake, showing radiographic evidence of multifocal pneumonia (PNA) on chest X-ray. His influenza DFA test was negative. He is currently receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin for his condition. 

The patient's ESRD/HD status is being managed with HD three times a week, monitoring renal recommendations, dosing medications accordingly, checking daily vancomycin levels, using a phosphate binder with meals, monitoring electrolytes, and avoiding intravenous fluids. 

His hypertension is being treated with metoprolol and captopril, replacing lisinopril. If he becomes hypertensive, amlodipine will be added first, followed by minoxidil if needed. 

For agitation related to Alzheimer's dementia, Haldol will be given as needed, and an EKG will be repeated to ensure no QTc prolongation. 

The patient's bladder cancer requires outpatient follow-up. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on a renal diet, avoiding IV fluids, and only fed when alert. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with heparin subcutaneously and stress ulcer prevention with an H2 blocker. VAP precautions are also in place."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bladder cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, and decreased oral intake, and radiographic evidence of multifocal pneumonia (PNA) on chest X-ray. The patient is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has multifocal PNA, which can worsen and lead to further respiratory distress or systemic infection.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESRD, and the ongoing infection and medications may contribute to AKI.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and the current situation may affect blood pressure control.
4. Agitation and delirium: The patient is agitated and confused, which can be attributed to his underlying dementia and the current illness.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing DVT.
6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
7. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, increasing the risk of infection.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with pneumonia and respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to a lung infection, likely bacterial. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 124/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen and antimicrobials to manage the infection. 

The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates, attributed to the same lung infection. Fluid management is being monitored due to hypovolemia, and the patient is undergoing hemodialysis for renal failure. The patient's hypertension is being treated with metoprolol, and consideration is being given to restarting lisinopril/amlodipine/minoxidil in the morning if the patient is hemodynamically stable. 

Nutritional support is encouraged through oral intake, with supplements considered if necessary. The patient's Alzheimer's dementia needs confirmation of baseline mental status. Haldol is being used to manage agitation. Code status is set at full code, and the patient accepts intubation and central line placement. 

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical conditions."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia and chronic renal failure who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has a history of pneumonia and is experiencing increased infiltrates in both lungs, likely due to a bacterial infection. She requires supplemental oxygen and antimicrobials to manage the infection. The patient also has hypovolemia and requires fluid resuscitation. She is on hemodialysis for renal failure. Her blood pressure needs to be controlled with medication. Nutritional support is being encouraged through oral intake with supplements, and a feeding tube may be considered. The patient's mental status is a concern, and her code status is full code with the family's consent for intubation and central line placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and multilobar infiltrates suggest a risk of worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort is crucial.
2. Sepsis: The bacterial pneumonia and hypovolemia increase the risk of sepsis. Monitoring vital signs, urine output, and organ function is essential to detect and manage sepsis promptly.
3. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing chronic renal failure may worsen due to the infection and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of hemodialysis as needed are important.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to infection, medications,"
