","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospital stay for GAS cellulitis. He presented with multi-organ failure, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and persistent respiratory failure following cardiac arrest. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, indicating a very poor prognosis due to anoxic brain injury. There is no evidence of coronary ischemia causing the cardiac arrest. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Neurologic Complications: The patient's low GCS score suggests a severe neurologic injury. Further assessment is needed, including daily neuro exams, neuro consultation, EEG, and consideration for a CT scan of the head. Holding sedation as able may also be beneficial.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently oxygenating well while on mechanical ventilation. Plans include weaning back to pressure support ventilation (PSV) according to prior settings. Tracheal care, VAP bundle, and holding sedation as able should be continued. ABG analysis and PSV with a 10/8 wean are also recommended.

3. GAS Cellulitis with Fasciotomies: The patient has completed an extended antibiotic course for GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies. Wound care consult for VAC dressing changes should be considered.

4. Leukocytosis: There is no"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for GAS cellulitis. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury, resulting in a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3. The prognosis for recovery is poor at this stage.

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, but there is an indication of tachypnea. Oxygenation is good, but the patient is breathing over the ventilator, indicating some degree of respiratory distress.

The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including a tracheostomy, right femoral groin line, and PICC line. There are also dressings for fasciotomies on the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and potassium levels. The patient also has hypernatremia and hyperglycemia.

The assessment and plan section outlines the patient's conditions and proposed treatments. The patient requires ongoing neurologic monitoring, management of respiratory failure, wound care for GAS cellulitis, evaluation of leukocytosis, treatment of hypertension, and management of acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of infections"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for GAS cellulitis. He presented two days following a cardiac arrest and is now showing signs of multi-organ failure, including acute kidney injury (ATN), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and persistent respiratory failure. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, indicating severe brain injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's low GCS score suggests a poor prognosis for recovery from anoxic brain injury.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently oxygenating well but has dysynchronous breathing and is breathing over the ventilator. Weaning back to pressure support ventilation (PSV) may be considered based on prior vent settings.
3. GAS Cellulitis with Fasciotomies: Although the patient currently does not have significant erythema or warmth, wound care consults should be sought for vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressing changes.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, but there is no clear source of infection. Pan cultures should be obtained, and antibiotics should be held until cultures result or the patient develops an infectious syndrome.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's current elevation in creatinine is likely pre-renal, possibly due to pulseless arrest. No evidence"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospital stay for GAS cellulitis. He presented with multi-organ failure, acute kidney injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and persistent respiratory failure following cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition is described as likely persistent vegetative state with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's cardiac arrest and prolonged period without oxygen supply may have caused anoxic brain injury. The prognosis is very poor, and additional therapeutic hypothermia is unlikely to be beneficial at this stage.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently oxygenating well but displays dysynchronous breathing and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator will be considered based on prior settings.
3. GAS Cellulitis with Fasciotomies: The patient had GAS cellulitis previously, which required fasciotomies. There is currently no significant erythema or warmth around the affected area, and the antibiotic course has been completed. Wound care consult is needed for vacuum-assisted closure dressing changes.

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with DM2, HTN and recent hospital stay with GAS cellulitis,
   multi-organ failure, ATN, VAP and persistent respiratory failure now
   presenting 2 days following cardiac arrest and likely persistent
   vegetative state.
   Cardiac Arrest and anoxic brain injury: unclear duration of pulseless
   arrest so it is difficult to gauge likely severity of anoxic brain
   injury.  However >48 hours after event, patient has GCS of 3 which
   would portend a very poor prognosis.  This far out from injury
   additional therapeutic hypothermia unlikely to be beneficial.  No
   evidence of coronary ischemia to cause the event.  The purported
   explaination of mucous plugging sounds plausible but we will need to
   get additional information from the healthcare staff who witnessed the
   event.
   - detailed daily neuro exams, hold sedation when able to enable neuro
   exams

   breathing and breathing over the vent.  Will wean back to PSV according
   to prior vent settings.

   GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies: currently w/o significant erythema or
   warmth and completed extended antibiotic course at last hospital stay.
   - wound care consult for VAC dressing changes
   Leukocytosis: no clear source of infection with unremarkable CXR and
   only with yeast from [**Hospital3 **] Ucx.
   - pan culture
   - hold antibiotics until cultures result or develops infectious
   syndrome
   Hypertension: home dose metoprolol
   Acute on Chronic renal failure: prior Cr at discharge was 1.4, current
   elevation likely pre-renal +/- ischemic ATN from pulseless arrest. No
   evidence of obstruction and no peripheral eosinophilia or rash to

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for gas cellulitis. He has experienced multi-organ failure, acute kidney injury (ATN), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and persistent respiratory failure following a cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition is described as likely in a persistent vegetative state.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: The patient's presentation suggests hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to the cardiac arrest and subsequent lack of oxygen supply to the brain. This condition can lead to permanent brain damage and result in a vegetative state or even death.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to persistent respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung infections, which can worsen the patient's condition.

3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient has shown signs of acute kidney injury, which may be pre-renal or ischemic in nature due to the pulseless arrest. Proper management is necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis without a clear source of infection. This could indicate a possible secondary infection or sepsis, which needs to be closely monitored and managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a recent hospital stay for GAS cellulitis. He has multi-organ failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and is in persistent vegetative state following cardiac arrest. His neurological status is described as unresponsive with decreased movement, tone, and absent corneal reflexes. He requires respiratory support through an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and has evidence of cerebral edema on head CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory support, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can lead to DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of medications like corticosteroids may increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure could worsen due to factors such as decreased renal perfusion, use of nephrotoxic medications, or ongoing ischemia to the kidneys.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are elevated, which requires careful management to avoid complications like cerebral edema.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for GAS cellulitis. He presented with septic shock and multi-organ failure, and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest during rehabilitation. The patient is now in a persistent vegetative state following global hypoxic ischemic injury as suggested by CT-Head findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently oxygenating well but may have dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. Given the prognosis, there will be an attempt to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but aggressive weaning down of settings will not be pursued.
2. Hypertension: Not currently an issue, but home dose metoprolol may be used as needed.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Prior creatinine at discharge was 1.4, and subsequent elevation is likely pre-renal or ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from pulseless arrest. There is no evidence of obstruction or signs of allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
4. Hypernatremia: Has resolved.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: No anion gap or severe hyperglycemia, but insulin sliding scale and TF will be continued.
6. Lines: PICC line and peripheral line are in place, and heparin, ranitidine, and VAP prophylaxis are being administered.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, recent hospital stay with GAS cellulitis, septic shock with multi-organ failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and anoxic brain injury. The patient's current condition includes global hypoxic ischemic injury as seen on head CT scan, minimal brainstem reflexes, no gag reflex, and unresponsiveness for more than 96 hours. The prognosis suggests that the patient will likely remain in a persistent vegetative state.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F)
- Heart rate: 75 bpm (range 73-95 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 116/44 mmHg (range 115-160/36-85 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (range 8-34 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on ventilator

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O"

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with DM2, HTN and recent hospital stay with GAS cellulitis,
   multi-organ failure, ATN, VAP and persistent respiratory failure now
   presenting 2 days following cardiac arrest and likely persistent
   vegetative state.
   Cardiac Arrest and anoxic brain injury: unclear duration of pulseless
   arrest so it is difficult to gauge likely severity of anoxic brain
   injury.  However >48 hours after event, patient has GCS of 3 which
   would portend a very poor prognosis.  Neuro feels 90% chance of
   persistent vegetative state.
   - detailed daily neuro exams, hold sedation when able to enable neuro
   exams
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - f/u final read for EEG
   Respiratory Failure: Currently oxygenating well but with dysynchronous
   breathing and breathing over the vent.  Will wean back to PSV according
   to prior vent settings.
   - trach care per procotol
   - VAP bundle
   - hold sedation as able
   - hold off on A-line pending determination of overall care plan
   - PSV with 10/8 wean O2 by sats
   GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies: currently w/o significant erythema or
   warmth and completed extended antibiotic course at last hospital stay.
   - VAC dressing changes
   - monitor
   Hypertension: home dose metoprolol
   Acute on Chronic renal failure: prior Cr at discharge was 1.4, current
   elevation likely pre-renal +/- ischemic ATN from pulseless arrest. No
   evidence of obstruction and no peripheral eosinophilia or rash to
   suggest AIN. Creat trending down.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for GAS cellulitis. He presented with multi-organ failure, acute kidney injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and persistent respiratory failure. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and is now in a likely persistent vegetative state. The neurologist estimates a 90% chance of persistent vegetative state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent Vegetative State: Given the patient's current condition and the neurologist's assessment, there is a high likelihood of the patient remaining in a persistent vegetative state.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, and weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to dysynchronous breathing patterns.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed, and home dose metoprolol should be continued.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, with an increase in creatinine levels. Pre-renal causes and ischemic acute tubular necrosis should be considered. Monitoring and fluid management are essential.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected carefully to avoid cerebral edema.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: Glycemic control should be maintained to prevent complications related to diabetes.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a recent hospital stay for gas cellulitis and septic shock with multi-organ failure. He experienced cardiac arrest during rehabilitation and has been unresponsive for over 96 hours. The CT scan of his head suggests global hypoxic ischemic injury. Neurological assessment shows no responsiveness, minimal brainstem reflexes, no gag reflex, and likely persistent vegetative state. The patient's prognosis has been discussed with the family, and his status has been changed to do not resuscitate (DNR). There is consideration of starting comfort measures only (CMO), which will be readdressed later this week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently oxygenates well but may experience dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. Given the prognosis, there may not be aggressive attempts to wean down settings.
2. GAS Cellulitis with Fasciotomies: Although currently without significant erythema or warmth, the patient had previous GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies. Infection should still be monitored for.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not currently an issue, but home dose metoprolol may be used as needed.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has had a subsequent elevation in creatinine likely due to pre-renal causes and ischemic acute tubular necrosis from the pulseless"

   CT HEAD (FINAL):  1. Interval obliteration of the brain sulci and loss
   of [**Doctor Last Name 734**]-white matter differentiation suggests global hypoxic ischemic
   injury.  2. Interval increase in opacification of the ethmoid sinuses
   and the left maxillary sinus.
   EEG (FINAL): Abnormal EEG due to the slow background with occasional
   suppressive bursts. These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy
   affecting both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications,
   metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
   Hypoxia is another possible explanation. Nevertheless, there were no
   areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure
   focal findings. There were no clearly epileptiform features.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for GAS cellulitis and septic shock.
- The patient experienced cardiac arrest during rehabilitation and has been unresponsive for over 96 hours.
- Neurological examination shows no responsiveness, minimal brainstem reflexes, and no gag reflex.
- CT scan of the head suggests global hypoxic ischemic injury, and EEG shows widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
- The patient's prognosis is likely to remain in a persistent vegetative state.
- The patient's code status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate), and there is consideration of starting comfort measures only (CMO).
- Respiratory failure: The patient is oxygenating well but at times shows dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. Vent settings will be modified to improve comfort.
- GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies: The area is currently without significant erythema or warmth, and the patient has completed an extended antibiotic course. Monitoring for signs of infection will continue.
- Hypertension: Not currently an issue, but home dose metoprolol will be used as needed.
- Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has been elevated due to pre-renal causes and ischemic acute tubular necrosis from pulseless arrest. Monitoring urine output"

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with DM2, HTN and recent hospital stay with GAS cellulitis, septic
   shock w/ multi-organ failure, ATN, VAP and persistent respiratory
   failure now presenting 2 days following cardiac arrest at rehab and
   likely persistent vegetative state.
   #Cardiac Arrest and anoxic brain injury: unclear duration of pulseless
   arrest so was difficult to gauge likely severity of anoxic brain
   injury.  CT-Head suggests global hypoxic ischemic injury. Neurology
   assessment is as such, with no responsiveness >96hours, minimal
   brainstem reflexes, no gag,  and likely to remain in persistent
   vegetative state. Prognosis was discussed with the family and his
   status has been changed to DNR, and there is consideration of starting
   CMO which may be discussed with the family today
   - Continue daily neuro exams, lighten sedation as appropriate to enable
   neuro exams
   - Neurology has signed off but is available for family meetings.
   - final reads of CT and EEG are consistent with global hypoxic injury.
   - getting Mannitol for possible component of cerebral edema on head CT.
   No change in nuero status since starting mannitaol. Will continue and
   follow serum Osms.
   #Respiratory Failure: Currently oxygenating well but at times,
   dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. Given prognosis,
   will attempt to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but will not
   aggressively attempt to wean down settings.
   - trach care per procotol
   - VAP bundle
   - hold sedation for neuro checks as possible
   # GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies: currently w/o significant erythema
   or warmth and completed extended antibiotic course at last hospital
   stay. No evidence of infection
   - Continue VAC dressing changes
   - monitor for signs of infection
   #Hypertension: Not currently an issue, will use home dose metoprolol as
   needed.
   #Acute on Chronic renal failure: prior Cr at discharge was 1.4,
   subsequent elevation likely pre-renal +/- ischemic ATN from pulseless
   arrest. No evidence of obstruction and no peripheral eosinophilia or
   rash to suggest AIN. Creat trending down, now at 1.3.
   -hold free water in setting of possible cerebral edema
   -monitor urine output

He presented with multi-organ failure, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and persistent respiratory failure. The patient experienced cardiac arrest at the rehabilitation facility and is likely in a persistent vegetative state. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation since admission. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 158/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury: The patient's cardiac arrest and global hypoxic-ischemic injury may have resulted in severe brain damage, leading to a persistent vegetative state. The prognosis for recovery is poor, and the patient may remain in this state.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from the pulseless arrest. Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid management will"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for GAS cellulitis and septic shock with multi-organ failure. He has experienced cardiac arrest, anoxic brain injury, and persistent respiratory failure. The patient is currently in a persistent vegetative state and has been declared DNR (do not resuscitate). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological complications: The patient's global hypoxic ischemic injury suggests a high risk of neurological complications, including persistent vegetative state or potential long-term cognitive impairment.
2. Respiratory failure: Despite oxygenating well, the patient's respiratory status may continue to be compromised due to VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels. Ongoing monitoring of renal function is necessary, especially considering the possibility of ischemic ATN (acute tubular necrosis).
4. Infection: The patient's history of GAS cellulitis and prolonged hospitalization increases the risk of developing further infections, including wound infections at the site of fasciotomies.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's recent episode of hypernatremia requires close monitoring to prevent recurrence.
6. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes mellitus needs to be carefully managed to avoid complications related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and recent hospitalization for gas (GAS) cellulitis and septic shock with multi-organ failure. The patient also had anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest and is now presenting in a persistent vegetative state. The CT-Head suggests global hypoxic ischemic injury.

Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest and Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, leading to anoxic brain injury. The duration of pulseless arrest is unclear, making it difficult to gauge the severity of the brain injury. Neurological assessment shows minimal brainstem reflexes, no gag, and a likely persistent vegetative state.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently oxygenates well but has dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the ventilator at times. Given the poor prognosis, the medical team will attempt to modify vent settings to improve comfort but will not aggressively attempt to wean down settings.

3. GAS Cellulitis with Fasciotomies: The patient had GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies but currently shows no significant erythema or warmth. An extended antibiotic course has been completed. There is no evidence of infection, but the medical team will continue with VAC dressing changes and monitor for signs of infection.

4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not currently an issue, and the medical"

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with DM2, HTN and recent hospital stay with GAS cellulitis, septic
   shock w/ multi-organ failure, ATN, VAP and persistent respiratory
   failure now presenting 2 days following cardiac arrest at rehab and
   likely persistent vegetative state.
   #Cardiac Arrest and anoxic brain injury: unclear duration of pulseless
   arrest so was difficult to gauge likely severity of anoxic brain
   injury.  CT-Head suggests global hypoxic ischemic injury. Neurology
   assessment is as such, with no responsiveness >96hours, minimal
   brainstem reflexes, no gag,  and likely to remain in persistent
   vegetative state. Prognosis was discussed with the family and his
   status has been changed to DNR, and there is consideration of starting
   CMO which may be discussed with the family today
   - Continue daily neuro exams, lighten sedation as appropriate to enable
   neuro exams
   - Neurology has signed off but is available for family meetings.
   - final reads of CT and EEG are consistent with global hypoxic injury.
   - getting Mannitol for possible component of cerebral edema on head CT.
   No change in nuero status since starting mannitaol. Will continue and
   follow serum Osms.
   #Respiratory Failure: Currently oxygenating well but at times,
   dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. Given prognosis,
   will attempt to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but will not
   aggressively attempt to wean down settings.
   - trach care per procotol
   - VAP bundle
   - hold sedation for neuro checks as possible
   # GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies: currently w/o significant erythema
   or warmth and completed extended antibiotic course at last hospital
   stay. No evidence of infection
   - Continue VAC dressing changes
   - monitor for signs of infection
   #Hypertension: Not currently an issue, will use home dose metoprolol as
   needed.
   #Acute on Chronic renal failure: prior Cr at discharge was 1.4,
   subsequent elevation likely pre-renal +/- ischemic ATN from pulseless
   arrest. No evidence of obstruction and no peripheral eosinophilia or
   rash to suggest AIN. Creat trending down, now at 1.0.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for gas cellulitis and septic shock with multi-organ failure. He experienced cardiac arrest and is now in a persistent vegetative state. The patient's prognosis is poor, and he has been placed on do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently oxygenates well but may experience dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the ventilator. Given the prognosis, the focus will be on improving comfort rather than aggressively attempting to wean down ventilator settings.
2. GAS Cellulitis with Fasciotomies: Although the patient is currently without significant erythema or warmth, there is a risk of infection due to the previous condition. Continued monitoring for signs of infection and ongoing VAC dressing changes are necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently not an issue, but using home-dose metoprolol as needed will be considered.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have elevated due to pulseless arrest and potential pre-renal or ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring urine output and avoiding free water administration in the setting of possible cerebral edema are recommended.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes should be managed with TF and NPH with insulin sliding scale, as there is no an"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 70M obesity, chronic respiratory failure s/p
   recent T+G in the setting of GAS cellulitis / compartment syndrome/
   sepsis, DM, HTN now admitted following arrest and hypoxic brain injury
   at rehab. Remains on mannitol and low dose propofol without any
   evidence of neurologic recovery.  Neuro eval estimates >90% chance
   persistent vegetative state.  Continues to require mech vent support as
   well as propofol

   No improvement in neurological status.   Chances of recovery beyond

   arrest/hypoxemic injury with unknown pulseless period and has not shown
   signs of improved neuro status.  CT-Head suggests global hypoxic
   ischemic injury.   Presence of myoclonus also c/w poor outcome.  No
   meaningful improvement in neuron exam since presentation.  Family is
   aware of prognosis and is discussing CMO status.  Pt presently DNI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for GAS cellulitis and septic shock with multi-organ failure. He experienced cardiac arrest at a rehabilitation facility and is now presenting with persistent respiratory failure, anoxic brain injury, and global hypoxic ischemic injury on CT-Head. Neurological assessments indicate minimal brainstem reflexes, no gag, and a likely persistent vegetative state. The patient has been changed to DNR and there is consideration of starting comfort measures only (CMO). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support and may continue to experience dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Hypertension: Although not currently an issue, the patient has a history of hypertension, which may require monitoring and management upon discharge.
3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and requires ongoing management of blood glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
4. GAS Cellulitis: Although the patient has completed an extended antibiotic course, there is a risk of recurrent infection or complications related to the previous cellulitis, such as fasciotomies.
5. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's brain injury may lead to long-term neurological deficits and a persistent vegetative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for GAS cellulitis and septic shock with multi-organ failure. He experienced cardiac arrest and is now in a persistent vegetative state with global hypoxic ischemic injury as suggested by CT-Head. The patient's prognosis was discussed with the family, and his status has been changed to do not resuscitate (DNR). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently oxygenating well but may experience dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent due to the persistent respiratory failure. The goal is to modify vent settings to improve comfort without aggressively attempting to wean down settings.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation. The VAP bundle should be continued to prevent infection.
3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, and his blood glucose levels should be monitored regularly. Insulin sliding scale and NPH with insulin will be used to manage his diabetes.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be managed with home dose metoprolol as needed.
5. GAS Cellulitis with Fasciotomies: Although the patient currently does not show signs of infection, monitoring for signs of infection and continuing vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospital stay with gas cellulitis and septic shock resulting in multi-organ failure, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient is currently in a persistent vegetative state following anoxic brain injury, as indicated by a CT scan of the head showing global hypoxic ischemic injury. The patient's prognosis was discussed with the family, and his status has been changed to do not resuscitate (DNR). 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is a need to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but aggressive attempts to wean down settings will not be made due to the prognosis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has VAP, and the bundle for preventing VAP should be continued.
3. Infection: Although the patient's GAS cellulitis seems to have resolved without significant erythema or warmth, it is important to monitor for signs of infection, especially since the patient underwent fasciotomies. VAC dressing changes should be continued.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently not an issue, but home dose metoprolol may be used as needed.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient"

   70M with DM2, HTN and recent hospital stay with GAS cellulitis, septic
   shock w/ multi-organ failure, ATN, VAP and persistent respiratory
   failure now presenting 2 days following cardiac arrest at rehab and
   likely persistent vegetative state.
   #Cardiac Arrest and anoxic brain injury: unclear duration of pulseless
   arrest so was difficult to gauge likely severity of anoxic brain
   injury.  CT-Head suggests global hypoxic ischemic injury. Neurology
   assessment is as such, with no responsiveness >96hours, minimal
   brainstem reflexes, no gag,  and likely to remain in persistent
   vegetative state. Prognosis was discussed with the family and his
   status has been changed to DNR, and there is consideration of starting
   CMO
   - Continue daily neuro exams, lighten sedation as appropriate to enable
   neuro exams
   - Neurology has signed off but is available for family meetings.
   - final reads of CT and EEG are consistent with global hypoxic injury.
   - continue mannitol
   #Respiratory Failure: Currently oxygenating well but at times,
   dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. Given prognosis,
   will attempt to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but will not
   aggressively attempt to wean down settings.
   - trach care per procotol
   - sedation for pain, dysynchronous breathing
 changed from propofol to
   midaz and fentanyl for lipemic blood labs
   - VAP bundle
   - hold sedation for neuro checks as possible
   # GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies: currently w/o significant erythema
   or warmth and completed extended antibiotic course at last hospital

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for gas cellulitis and septic shock. He presented with multi-organ failure, acute tubular necrosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, persistent respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient has been unresponsive for more than 96 hours, with minimal brainstem reflexes, and is likely in a persistent vegetative state. The prognosis has been discussed with the family, and the patient's status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate). The plan is to continue daily neuro exams, lighten sedation as appropriate, and consider comfort measures only (CMO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently oxygenating well but may experience dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. There is a need to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but aggressive weaning down of settings will not be pursued.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Measures such as the VAP bundle should be implemented to prevent and manage this complication.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other factors may increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for"

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with DM2, HTN and recent hospital stay with GAS cellulitis, septic
   shock w/ multi-organ failure, ATN, VAP and persistent respiratory
   failure now presenting following cardiac arrest at rehab and likely
   persistent vegetative state.
   #Cardiac Arrest and anoxic brain injury: unclear duration of pulseless
   arrest so was difficult to gauge likely severity of anoxic brain
   injury.  CT-Head suggests global hypoxic ischemic injury. Neurology
   assessment is as such, with no responsiveness >96hours, minimal
   brainstem reflexes, no gag, and likely to remain in persistent
   vegetative state. Prognosis was discussed with the family and his
   status has been changed to DNR, and there is consideration of starting
   CMO, likely tomorrow
   - Continue daily neuro exams, lighten sedation as appropriate to enable
   neuro exams
   - Neurology has signed off but is available for family meetings.
   - final reads of CT and EEG are consistent with global hypoxic injury.
   - continue mannitol drip with goal Na 150, follow serum osms
   #Respiratory Failure: Currently oxygenating well but at times,
   dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. Given prognosis,
   will attempt to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but will not
   aggressively attempt to wean down settings. On [**10-11**], occasionally
   breathing at low RR, will follow, consider AC if necessary overnight
   and inadequately ventilating.
   - trach care per procotol
   - sedation for pain, dysynchronous breathing
 changed from propofol to
   midaz and fentanyl for lipemic blood labs, now on Morphine, weaning off
   Fentanyl
   - VAP bundle
   - hold sedation for neuro checks as possible
   # GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies: currently w/o significant erythema
   or warmth and completed extended antibiotic course at last hospital
   stay. No evidence of infection
   - Continue VAC dressing changes
   - monitor for signs of infection
   #Hypertension: Not currently an issue, will use home dose metoprolol as
   needed.
   # Nutrition: Nutren Renal with 45 g beneprotein at 50/hour
   #Diabetes mellitus: no anion gap or severe hyperglycemia

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for gas gangrene cellulitis and septic shock with multi-organ failure. The patient experienced cardiac arrest and is now in a persistent vegetative state with global hypoxic ischemic injury as per the CT scan and EEG results.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is a need to optimize the ventilator settings for comfort and prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Implementation of the VAP bundle, including proper hand hygiene, oral care, and weaning off sedation, is essential.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be continued.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcer. Prophylactic medications like famotidine should be continued.
5. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): Long-term catheterization increases the risk of CAUTI. Proper catheter care and hygiene are crucial.
6. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immune system"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a recent hospital stay for gas cellulitis, septic shock with multi-organ failure, acute tubular necrosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and persistent respiratory failure. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest at the rehabilitation facility and is likely in a persistent vegetative state. His neurological assessment shows minimal brainstem reflexes, no gag reflex, and unresponsiveness for more than 96 hours. A CT scan of the head suggests global hypoxic ischemic injury. The prognosis was discussed with the family, and his status has been changed to do not resuscitate (DNR), with consideration of starting comfort measures only (CMO) tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently oxygenates well but may experience dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the ventilator. Given the prognosis, there will be an attempt to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but aggressive weaning down of settings will not be pursued.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, and appropriate measures such as the VAP bundle will be implemented. Sedation for pain and dysynchronous breathing will be used, and neuro checks will be performed while minimizing sedation.

   dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. Given prognosis,
   will attempt to modify vent settings to improve comfort, but will not

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and recent hospital stay for gas cellulitis and septic shock with multi-organ failure. The patient presented with persistent respiratory failure after cardiac arrest at rehab and is likely in a persistent vegetative state. He has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, and fasciotomies for GAS cellulitis with leg wound. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate), and there is consideration of starting comfort measures only (CMO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently oxygenating well but may experience dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the vent. There is a possibility of inadequate ventilation, and the healthcare team may consider assisted ventilation if necessary.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. The healthcare team is following a VAP bundle to prevent and monitor for this complication.
3. Wound Infection: The patient has undergone fasciotomies for GAS cellulitis, and there is a small amount of erythema on his leg today. Close monitoring for signs of infection is important, and appropriate wound care should be continued.
4. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is currently not an issue, it should be monitored, and home dose metoprol"

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney function with increased creatinine levels. The liver function tests are within normal range, and electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently oxygenates well but may exhibit dysynchronous breathing and breathing over the ventilator. Given the prognosis, the healthcare team aims to modify vent settings to improve comfort but will not aggressively attempt to wean down settings.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP, and measures are being taken to prevent it through the implementation of a VAP bundle.

3. GAS Cellulitis with Fasciotomies: The patient had GAS cellulitis with fasciotomies in the past. Currently, there is no significant erythema or warmth, and the patient has completed an extended antibiotic course. However, there is a small amount of erythema on one leg today, which will be monitored for signs of infection.
