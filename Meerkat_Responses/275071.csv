","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been placed on invasive ventilation and has a PICC line inserted. The patient's medical history, allergies, last doses of antibiotics, and review of systems are documented.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/52 to 114/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and other parameters within normal range.

The physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished without acute distress. There is purulence around the tracheostomy site, mild sternal wound erythema, trace lower extremity edema, and normal neurologic assessment. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (15.4 K/uL), hematocrit (29.0%), platelet count (161), creatinine (0.9 mg/dL), and glucose levels (106 mg/dL). The coagulation profile indicates prolonged prothrombin time (18.8), partial thromboplastin time (36.7), and an international normalized ratio (1.7). Other laboratory values, including electrolytes and calcium levels, are within normal range.

Imaging and microbiology reports are mentioned but not provided in the given information.

The assessment and plan include three main points: fever, hypotension, and respiratory issues. The fever is attributed to possible cellulitis around the tracheostomy site or pneumonia, and the patient will continue receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone while awaiting culture data. The tracheostomy site will be swabbed for culture, and consideration will be given to removing the PICC line based on blood culture results.

The hypotension was initially treated with an IV bolus and the patient is now showing good urine output. The patient will continue to be monitored in the ICU.

For the respiratory issue, the patient will wear a tracheostomy collar today. 

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU due to the presence of fever, potential infection, hypotension, and respiratory support. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, respiratory failure, and thromboembolic events."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   His blood cultures have returned positive for GPC
s and he has been
   borderline hypotensive requiring IVF
s. His PICC will be discontinued
   once peripheral IV
s have been placed. He will remain in the ICU till
   he has stabilized hemodynamically and would prefer to hold off on trach
   collar trials till sepsis has resolved..
   Patient is ill but improving

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who is currently in the ICU. He has a history of undergoing an aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) three times. 

The patient presented with hypotension and fever, and was initially suspected to have pneumonia and cellulitis. Blood cultures revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which could indicate a bacterial infection. The patient's blood pressure was found to be low, possibly due to sepsis, and responded to fluid administration. 

The patient's respiratory distress was attributed to his inability to clear secretions, leading to the decision to place a tracheostomy. He is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400-500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's cardiovascular assessment revealed an improved EKG from prior, no chest pain, and low blood pressure on medication in the setting of sepsis. He has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and is currently in sinus rhythm on EKG. He is taking amiodarone and coumadin as outpatient medications.

The patient also has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man who is one month post-operative after undergoing an AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3. He was admitted with possible pneumonia and cellulitis, with a fever of 100.9 degrees. The likely etiologies for his fever and sepsis are pneumonia and cellulitis, as indicated by CT findings and erythema over the sternum and trach site. There is also a concern for a PICC line infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/57 to 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. He is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode with a set volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, and a respiratory system compliance of 45.5 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.4 K/uL and bands of 79.8%. Other lab values, including hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal range. Blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3.
- He presented with fever, WBC of 18.7, and possible pneumonia and cellulitis.
- The patient has chronic respiratory failure and hypotension.
- The likely etiologies for fever are pneumonia, cellulitis, and possible mediastinitis.
- The patient had a PICC line infection, which has been removed.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending.
- The patient is currently on PS and receiving Tylenol for fever.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone and coumadin.
- The patient also has a history of CVA with left hemiparesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could indicate sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Fever: The patient's persistent fever suggests an ongoing infection.
4. Possible Mediastinitis: Given the patient's recent surgeries and CT findings, there is a concern for mediastinitis, a serious infection in the mediastinum.
5. PICC Line Infection: Although the PICC line has been removed, there is a risk of bacteremia due to the potential infection.
6. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI): The patient's central line may be at risk for infection, which can lead to bloodstream infection.
7. Organisms: Identification of the causative organism through blood cultures is pending, which will help guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
8. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, hypotension, and elevated WBC count, suggest the possibility of sepsis.
9. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), especially due to immobilization in the ICU.
10. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged bedrest and poor nutrition can increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
11. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
12. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Long-term use of NSAIDs or anticoagulants can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, infection parameters, and renal function. Prompt identification and treatment of potential complications are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recent AVR/MVR who was admitted to the ICU with leukocytosis and fevers initially thought to be a line infection, but now suspected to be from the lungs. He has been tracheostomized and is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has rhonchi in his right lower lobe on auscultation. His blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an ongoing infection. The chest X-ray reveals an opacity in the right base, suggesting a possible lung infection. The patient is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged ventilation and the presence of rhonchi in the right lower lobe, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels indicate an ongoing infection, which increases the likelihood of VAP.
2. Pulmonary embolism: Although the patient's physical examination does not show any signs of edema, the recent surgery and immobilization increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism.
3. Sepsis: The combination of fevers, leukocytosis, and suspected lung infection"

   1.       Fevers, leukocytosis
 initially thought to be line infection,
   but only
 bottles GPC, but with increased secretions, RLL opacity,
   lungs more likely source.   Given residence in chronic vent facility;
   would treat for HAP with vanc/cefepime.
   - Follow-up sputum cultures; repeating CXR.
   - Wld benefit from MIE to help with secretions.
   - Goal to come down on PS during day.
   2.  CV
 CAD, recent valvular repair, no chest pain
   - Cont ASA, statin; will slowly add back cardiac meds as BP tolerates
   (low dose ACEI).
   - For AF/flutter: on coumadin, amiodarone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted with possible pneumonia and cellulitis. He has a history of recent cardiac surgeries (AVR, MVR, CABG x 3) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's fever has increased to 100.9 degrees Celsius, and his white blood cell count is elevated at 18.7 K/uL. Cultures have shown growth of pseudomonas from sputum, indicating a possible pneumonia. The patient also has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci, raising concerns for a PICC line infection. He is currently on antibiotics (Vanc and cefepime) for ventilator-associated pneumonia and will continue for an 8-day course until [**2125-9-27**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying pneumonia is likely limiting his ability to transition to a tracheostomy collar. He is currently on pressure support (PS) ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was initially low but responded to fluids. He is on medications to manage his blood pressure.
3. Fever: The patient's fever has persisted, indicating an ongoing infection. He is being monitored closely for any signs of sepsis.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and flutter, for which he is on amiodarone and coumadin. His EKG has improved, but he remains"

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3. He presented with fever, elevated white blood cell count, and possible pneumonia and cellulitis. The patient was admitted and started on antibiotics. He developed a drug rash after receiving antibiotics, so the antibiotics were changed. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on amiodarone and coumadin. He also has a history of CVA with left hemiparesis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/59 to 131/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, and normal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's sputum culture shows the presence of gram-negative rods, consistent with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The respiratory culture also shows moderate growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The assessment includes fever, respiratory failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted with possible pneumonia and cellulitis. He has a history of AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3. The patient's fever has increased to 100.9, and his WBC count is elevated at 18.7. He has been treated with cefepime and vancomycin, but due to the presence of GNRs (Gram-negative rods) in his sputum culture, the antibiotic regimen has been changed to ciprofloxacin, aztreonam, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying pneumonia and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory parameters will be necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and positive sputum culture for GNRs suggest an active infection. Regular assessment of vital signs and cultures will be required to monitor for any worsening infection or development of new infections.
3. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of cardiac surgeries (AVR, MVR, CABG x 3) and presents with low blood pressure in the setting of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of cardiovascular status, including blood pressure and heart rhythm, is crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who recently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AvR), and mitral valve replacement (MVR). He is currently experiencing fever and has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) in his sputum. The patient developed a rash after receiving ceftriaxone, a type of antibiotic, which improved with the administration of Benadryl and Sarna. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/56 to 131/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 9 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 85. 

The patient's physical examination reveals facial droop, diffuse rhonchi in the lungs, irregular heart rhythm, soft abdomen, and an improving rash. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.4 K/uL, elevated creat"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a medical history of recent AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3 surgeries. He is currently admitted with possible pneumonia and cellulitis, and the most likely etiology of his fever is pneumonia given the CT findings and moderate growth of Pseudomonas. The patient has thick mucus suctioned from his tracheostomy tube, and his white blood cell count is elevated at 18.7.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, as indicated by his need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration due to underlying pneumonia and difficulty in clearing secretions.

2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which may be related to sepsis or his cardiovascular conditions. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary, especially during the course of treatment for pneumonia.

3. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be due to an ongoing infection or sepsis. Monitoring temperature and initiating appropriate antipyretic measures as needed is important.

4. Potential central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): Although the tip of the patient's PICC line did not grow anything, there is still a concern for a potential contaminant or developing infection. Close monitoring of the patient's blood cultures and coagulation profile is necessary.

5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been tested for C. diff infection and the result is negative. However, appropriate measures should still be taken to prevent its development.

6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and flutter, and is currently on amiodarone and coumadin. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and adjusting medication dosages as necessary is important to prevent cardiac complications.

7. Potential tracheostomy site infection: The patient has thick mucus suctioned from his tracheostomy tube, which increases the risk of developing a tracheostomy site infection. Close monitoring of the site and appropriate antibiotic coverage may be required.

8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient is receiving heparin subcutaneously and coumadin for DVT prophylaxis due to his prolonged immobilization and surgical history. Monitoring coagulation parameters and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed is important to prevent DVT.

In summary, the potential medical complications for this patient include respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, potential central line-associated bloodstream infection, C. diff infection, cardiac arrhythmias, tracheostomy site infection, and deep vein thrombosis."

The initial assessment indicates that the most likely etiology of his fever and sepsis is pneumonia, given the CT findings and moderate growth of Pseudomonas on sputum culture. The patient also has respiratory failure, chronic hypotension, and fever.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/53 mmHg to 136/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. The physical examination reveals a tracheostomy tube in place with thick secretions, and chest rhonchi bilaterally. The patient is arousable and responds to questions.

The laboratory results show elevated WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly low hematocrit. The electrolytes are within normal limits, but the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated. The INR is subtherapeutic at 1.8.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch tall individual with a weight not provided. They were admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is acute on chronic and associated with PsA PNA (Pneumonia). The patient has been experiencing difficulty tolerating pressure support (PS) and has been on increased ventilatory support. There is a facial droop on the left side, diffuse rhonchi and crackles at the right base, and bilateral pleural effusions with a larger one on the right side. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and lactate levels. Other lab results indicate abnormalities in potassium, magnesium, phosphate, PT/PTT/INR, and various electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory condition is described as acute on chronic with PsA PNA. They continue to require increased ventilatory support and have difficulty tolerating PS, predominantly due to secretions. This may indicate a persistent need for mechanical ventilation and potential complications related to prolonged ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung injury.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, initially thought to be related to a PICC line infection. However, it is now considered to be related to PNA. This could lead to complications like organ perfusion issues and septic shock if not properly managed.

3. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever,"

","The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of recent cardiac surgeries (AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3) who was admitted with pneumonia and cellulitis. He has been diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure, hypotension, and fever. The patient has a rash due to an allergy to ceftriaxone and has been experiencing muscle spasms in his bilateral lower extremities and left arm at night. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left hemiparesis.

The patient's current medications include ASA, statin, ACEi, amiodarone, and coumadin. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/61 mmHg to 137/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium levels, and normal creatinine levels. The most recent sputum culture revealed the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The patient has been started on tobramycin based on the culture data.

The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube and controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with settings of Vt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who is 1 month post-avr, mvr, and cabg x 3. He was admitted with pneumonia and cellulitis and is now experiencing fever, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has a history of afib/flutter and a previous cva with left hemiparesis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever and respiratory distress, suggest an underlying pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and consider bronchoscopy to improve airways and clear secretions.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and presence of multi-drug resistant pseudomonas and e. coli in the sputum, there is a concern for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment are crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, particularly in the setting of sepsis. It is important to continue monitoring his blood pressure and adjusting his medications accordingly.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of afib/flutter and coronary artery disease. Close monitoring of his cardiac status, particularly while on mechanical ventilation, is essential. His medications should be reviewed and adjusted as needed.
5. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs should be closely monitored, especially considering his inability to eat orally. Providing appropriate enteral nutrition is important for his recovery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who has been admitted with pneumonia and cellulitis. He recently underwent an AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, chronic hypotension, and fever. The assessment suggests that the most likely etiology of his fever is pneumonia, considering the CT findings and moderate growth of pseudomonas and E. coli on sputum. The patient also has a history of CVA with left hemiparesis, which has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has difficulty clearing secretions and is currently on AC due to thick secretions. There is a possibility of further respiratory distress if the underlying pneumonia worsens.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and cellulitis. There is a concern for mediastinitis, as indicated by the CT findings and the presence of GNRs (Pseudomonas and E. coli) in the sputum. Blood culture results are pending.
3. Hypotension: The patient has chronic hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
4. Fever/Sepsis: The patient has a fever of 100.9 degrees, suggesting an ongoing infection. The most likely source of infection appears to be pneumonia.
5. Muscle spasms: The patient experiences bilateral LEs and L arm at night, possibly due to medication or"

   67 year old man 1 month s/p AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3, now with fever to
   100.9, WBC 18.7 admitted with pneumonia and possible cellulitis.
    # Fever/Sepsis Most likely etiology is pneumonia given CT findings and
   moderate growth of pseudomonas and e. coli on sputum. Also with thick
   mucus suctioned from trach. Blood culture x 1 with GPC, concern for
   PICC line infection though tip not growing anything and there was only
   one blood cx with coag negative staph therefore likely a contaminant.
   Sputum with multidrug resistant pseudomonas
   - change to tobramycin based on culture data, 2 week course, (on day
   4), trough Q3days or if Cr changes
   - tylenol prn fever
   # Respiratory distress: Pt was d/c'ed with trach due to inability to
   clear secretions. Discharged with trach collar and vent at night.
   Currently on AC due to difficulty with thick secretions.  Underlying
   pneumonia likely limiting factor for patient to transition to normal
   settings.  Had bronch yesterday
   - AC as needed
   - Continue home albuterol
   - lasix PRN
   # Cardiovascular: EKG improved from prior. No chest pain. BP was low on
   med in setting of sepsis. BP now stable.
   - continue ASA, statin
   - continue ACEi
   - continue BB low dose
   - hold CaCh blocker
   - telemetry as pt on vent, has history of afib
   # H/o afib/flutter: Currently in sinus on EKG. On amiodarone and
   Coumadin as outpatient, INR still subtheraputic
   - Coumadin 5mg today
   - monitor coags
   - Continue amio
   # Muscle spasms: bilateral LEs and L arm at night. ? etiology [**3-19**]
   medication.  Again last night
   - will monitor
   - oxycodone PRN HS
   # H/o CVA: Left hemiparesis improved as L LE now has some strength.
   - Continue statin, aspirin, Coumadin
   # Anxiety:
   - start celexa 10mg
   - low dose ativan PRN for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and possible cellulitis. He had undergone an AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3 one month prior to admission. The patient's fever has been improving, and his WBC count is decreasing. He is currently on a 2-week course of tobramycin based on culture data. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to thick mucus secretions, which led to the placement of a tracheostomy tube. He is also experiencing muscle cramps, particularly at night, and is being given oxycodone for pain relief. The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, and his EKG has improved. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient's INR is still subtherapeutic despite being on Coumadin. He also has a history of CVA with left hemiparesis, which has improved. The patient's anxiety is being managed with medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying pneumonia and difficulty clearing secretions may lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of low blood pressure, particularly during sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypotension.
3. Fever: The patient's initial fever has improved, but continued monitoring is required to prevent any potential"

","The patient is a 74-inch-old individual in the ICU with pseudomonal pneumonia. They are currently on mechanical ventilation via CPAP/PSV mode, with set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 74. Their ABG shows a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, and PaO2 of 16 mmHg. They have been receiving tobramycin, lasix, midazolam, fentanyl, ranitidine, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, miconazole cream, metoprolol, and coumadin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/61 to 128/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, trace lower extremity edema, muscle wasting, warm skin, attentive behavior, purposeful movement, normal tone, and weakness in the left arm and leg.

The patient's lab results include a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 194 K/uL, sodium level of 131 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.8 mg/dL, chloride level of 33 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 27.0%, BUN level of 16 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 106 mg/dL, and platelet count of 161 K/uL. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR levels of 20.1/30.6/1.9, differential white blood cell counts, calcium level of 8.0 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL, phosphate level of 3.7 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 0.8 mmol/L.

The patient's chest X-ray is stable, and there are no new microbiology findings. The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure due to chronic pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypotension (resolved), and fever (resolved). The patient is receiving suctioning every hour, doing well on pressure support, and had a diuresis of 1 L yesterday. Further diuresis will be held off for now, with a goal of achieving even tidal volumes and the possibility of receiving 10 IV of lasix if necessary."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress.
- Vital signs are within normal range, with a slight variation in blood pressure.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 3,130 mL and output of 2,585 mL, resulting in a balance of 545 mL.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and decreased hemoglobin levels.
- Other lab values are within normal limits.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, ranitidine, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection in the body.
2. Fluid imbalance: The difference between fluid input and output could indicate fluid retention or dehydration, which may require further investigation and management.
3. Anemia: The decreased hemoglobin levels suggest a possible anemia, which could be caused by various factors such as blood loss or inadequate production.
4. Medication reactions or side effects: Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's history of rash with ceftriaxone indicates a potential allergic reaction to certain medications. Monitoring for any adverse reactions is essential.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper surveillance and infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man who is currently in the ICU. He has a history of pneumonia, possible cellulitis, and recent surgeries (AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3). He presents with fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on mechanical ventilation. He has been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and has shown improvement. However, he still has an elevated white blood cell count and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying pneumonia and difficulty clearing secretions may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of ongoing infection and sepsis.
3. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulant therapy. His blood pressure has been low, which may be related to sepsis or his cardiovascular medications.
4. Muscle Spasms: The patient is experiencing bilateral lower extremity and left arm spasms, possibly due to medication side effects or other causes.
5. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and is being started on medication for this condition.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who underwent AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3 one month ago. He was admitted with pneumonia and possible cellulitis, with a fever of 100.9. The most likely etiology of the fever is pneumonia, considering the CT findings and moderate growth of pseudomonas and E. coli in the sputum. The patient has thick mucus suctioned from his tracheostomy tube, and the sputum contains MDR pseudomonas.

The patient was discharged with a tracheostomy and ventilator at night due to the inability to clear secretions. Currently, he is on AC (assisted cough) due to difficulty with thick secretions. The underlying pneumonia is likely limiting his transition to normal settings. He had a bronchoscopic evaluation yesterday.

The patient's cardiovascular status has improved, with an improved EKG. No chest pain was reported, and his blood pressure is stable. He will continue with ASA, statin, ACEi, and low-dose beta-blocker. Telemetry will be continued as the patient is on a ventilator, considering his history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and is on amiodarone and Coumadin as an outpatient. His INR is still subtherapeutic. He will receive Coumadin 4mg today, and his coagulation status will be monitored"
