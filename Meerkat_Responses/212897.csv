   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   probable multi-focal PNA.
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**7-27**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3066**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4326**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's Ssridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  Not drainable at present.
   - Continue empiric treatment with clindamycin. Given fever and
   increased WBC count, will expand coverage to include vanc and Zosyn
   - brief course of increased steroids to attempt to decrease extent of
   neck swelling
   - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass
   - ENT following
   # Fevers: Low grade temps overnight.  Ddx includes infected neck fluid
   collection (though does not appear infected on CT scan) versus PNA seen
   on CT. WBC rising.  Pt not currently showing signs of sepsis.
   - Expand antibiotic coverage as above
   - culture today
   - mini BAL
   # Drop in HCT: pt
s Hct was 42 on admission (baseline high 30s), then
   dropped to 27 after getting IVF.  Also, question of blood being drawn
   proximal to IV being run, possibly causing significant hemodilution.
   No e/o gross hemorrhage at present, although pt could have blood in ant
   neck collection.
   -          Trend HCT, appears stable
   -          Guaiac stools
   #ARF: Ddx includes pre-renal (pt not taking much PO) versus intrinsic
   or obstructive. Will start tube feeds today and trend SCr; also check
   urine lytes and eos.
   # CAD: s/p 5 vessel CABG.  CE negative x2 since presentation.  No CP.
   - Continue ASA
   - hold Coreg since not taking PO; PRN IV BB
   - hold statin since no PO access
   # CHF/Cardiomyopathy: last TTE in [**6-23**] w/ EF 35-40%.
   - holding Lasix given mild ARF
   - holding Coreg, lisinopril, spironolactone given no PO
   #Afib/CVA: in sinus at present. Rate 70s. INR 1.4.  Coumadin had been
   on hold peri-procedure (trach dilation).
   - holding Coumadin
   - consider restarting BB
   - hold mexiletine for now
   #DM II: RISS plus lantus (will dose reduce lantus to 16u, normally on
   32u.  Uptitrate PRN)

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and stridor. He has a fluid collection in the anterior neck following tracheal dilation, and there is a suspicion of acute airway compromise related to the procedure. The patient's symptoms could be due to rebound subglottic swelling from the recent procedure, but this is not confirmed. An anterior neck collection may be related to the airway compromise or a recent infection. The patient has low-grade fevers, an increased white blood cell count, and is being treated empirically for possible infection. Antibiotic coverage is being expanded to include vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient's hematocrit level has dropped significantly after receiving intravenous fluids, and the cause of this drop needs to be investigated further. There is a concern for acute renal failure, which could be pre-renal, intrinsic, or obstructive in nature. The patient's cardiovascular status post-CABG is stable, but medications such as aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins need to be managed carefully due to the patient's inability to take oral medications. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. His atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm, but he is not taking oral medications for it.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   probable multi-focal PNA.
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**7-27**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3066**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4326**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's Ssridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  Not drainable at present.
   - Tx w/ empiric abx: unasyn & clinda
   - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass
   - ENT following
   - Repeat imaging of neck in AM to see if collection is drainable
   - Con't outpt steroids for subglottic stenosis; however, will give
   hydrocort IV since no PO access to give prednisone
   # Fevers: reportedly up to 102 in ED.  Was >101 on arrival here.
   Suspect fevers are infectious in etiology given probable PNA on imaging
   & possible infectious collection in neck.  UA nml. WBC also elevated.
   Lactate nml.  Pt not currently showing signs of sepsis.
   - Tx for presumed PNA w/ Unasyn
   - CIS
   # Drop in HCT: pt
s Hct was 42 on admission (baseline high 30s), then
   dropped to 27 after getting IVF.  Also, question of blood being drawn
   proximal to IV being run, possibly causing significant hemodilution.
   No e/o gross hemorrhage at present, although pt could have blood in ant
   neck collection.
   -          Repeat hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   # CAD: s/p 5 vessel CABG.  CE negative x2 since presentation.  No CP.
   - hold ASA given possible procedure for neck collection
   - hold Coreg since not taking PO; PRN IV BB
   - hold statin since no PO access
   # CHF/Cardiomyopathy: last TTE in [**6-23**] w/ EF 35-40%.
   - hold lasix ON given unclear which direction pt is heading-->if pt
   stabilizes overnight & fevers improve, consider restarting in AM
   - holding Coreg, lisinopril, spironolactone given no PO
   #Afib/CVA: in sinus at present. Rate 70s. INR 1.4.  Coumadin had been
   on hold peri-procedure (trach dilation).
   - hold coumadin for possible procedure
   - hold BB given no OG/NG access; will give IV metop PRN increased rate
   - hold mexiletine for same reason
   #DM II: RISS plus lantus (will dose reduce lantus to 16u, normally on

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
- He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and stridor, and was found to have fluid collection in the anterior neck after undergoing tracheal dilation, as well as probable multi-focal pneumonia.
- The patient has airway compromise due to subglottic stenosis following multiple intubations. There is an anterior neck collection that may be related to the recent procedure.
- The patient's fever is suspected to be infectious in nature, possibly due to pneumonia or an infectious collection in the neck.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped significantly after receiving intravenous fluids, raising concerns about potential hemorrhage or hemodilution.
- The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35-40% and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
- The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 70s and an INR of 1.4.
- The patient has type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Compromise: The patient's subglottic stenosis and history of multiple intubations increase the risk of airway compromise. This could lead to respiratory distress or failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient's fevers, elevated white"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of low-grade fevers. The patient underwent an OGT (likely an oral glucose tolerance test) and had a Mini-BAL (mini-bronchoalveolar lavage) yesterday. Antibiotics were changed to Vanc/Zosyn + clinda. The patient also experienced multiple episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on telemetry, so Coreg was restarted at a lower dose.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies were reported.

Medications:
- Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn) was given on 08/01/2178 at 02:00 PM.
- Piperacillin was given on 08/02/2178 at 12:00 AM.
- Clindamycin was given on 08/02/2178 at 12:30 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   probable multi-focal PNA.
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**7-27**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3066**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4326**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's sridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  Not drainable at present.
   - Continue empiric treatment with clindamycin as well as vanc and Zosyn
   - brief course of increased steroids to attempt to decrease extent of
   neck swelling
   - keep intubated for now; will consider tomorrow
   - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass
   - ENT following
   # Fevers: Low grade temps overnight.  Ddx includes infected neck fluid
   collection (though does not appear infected on CT scan) versus PNA seen
   on CT. WBC rising.  Pt not currently showing signs of sepsis.
   - Con
t expanded antibiotic coverage as above
   - culture today
   - mini BAL
   # Drop in HCT: pt
s Hct was 42 on admission (baseline high 30s), then
   dropped to 27 after getting IVF.  Also, question of blood being drawn
   proximal to IV being run, possibly causing significant hemodilution.
   No e/o gross hemorrhage at present, although pt could have blood in ant
   neck collection.
   -          Trend HCT, appears stable
   -          Guaiac stools
   #ARF: Ddx includes pre-renal (pt not taking much PO) versus intrinsic
   or obstructive. Will start tube feeds today and trend SCr.  Crt
   stable.  No eos in urine/periphery.
   # CAD: s/p 5 vessel CABG.  CE negative x2 since presentation.  No CP.
   - Restarted coreg, aspirin, will resume statin as well since pt has OGT
   # CHF/Cardiomyopathy: last TTE in [**6-23**] w/ EF 35-40%.
   - holding Lasix given mild ARF
   - Con
t Coreg; Consider restarting lisinopril & spironolactone today
   #Afib/CVA: in sinus at present. Rate 70s. INR 1.4.  Coumadin had been
   on hold peri-procedure (trach dilation).
   - holding Coumadin
   - consider restarting BB
   - Restart mexiletine
   #DM II: RISS plus lantus (will increase lantus dose to home dose of 32u
   QHS)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, complicated by cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and subglottic stenosis (after multiple intubations), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35%-40%, who presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath and stridor. The patient underwent tracheal dilation on July 27th and was found to have a fluid collection in the anterior neck, as well as probable multi-focal pneumonia (PNA).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: The patient's history of subglottic stenosis and multiple intubations, along with the recent tracheal dilation procedure, raises concerns about acute airway compromise due to rebound subglottic swelling or other complications related to the procedure. The anterior neck collection may be related to airway compromise or an infectious collection.

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures overnight. This could be due to an infected neck fluid collection or PNA seen on CT scan. The rising white blood cell count also supports the possibility of infection.

3. Hematocrit (HCT) drop: The patient's HCT dropped from 42 on admission to 27 after receiving"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of low-grade fevers. The patient underwent an OGT (possibly an endoscopy), had a Mini-BAL (mini-bronchoalveolar lavage), and had antibiotics changed to Vanc/Zosyn + clinda. The patient is experiencing multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on telemetry and has been restarted on Coreg at a lower dose. Blood cultures were obtained at 01:34 PM, urine culture at 01:34 PM, and sputum culture at 01:35 PM. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient received different doses of antibiotics including Ampicillin/Sulbactam, Piperacillin, Clindamycin, and Vancomycin. Propofol infusion is being administered at 35 mcg/Kg/min. Pantoprazole (Protonix) was given at 09:52 PM, and Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) was started at 12:00 AM on 08-02. Other medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and unspecified other ICU medications.

Review of Systems is unchanged from admission except for low-grade fevers. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), current temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 72 bpm within normal range, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,718 mL and output of 1,660 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 58 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and autoflow, set Vt of 600 mL, PS of 0 cmH2O, RR set at 16, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and other parameters within normal range.

Lab results show WBC count ranging from 7.4 to 15.1 thousand/mm3, Hct ranging from 26.6 to 38.3%, Plt count ranging from 113 to 201 thousand/mm3, Cr ranging from 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL, Glucose ranging from 193 to 329 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range. Microbiology results of the Mini-BAL show no PMNs or microorganisms seen on gram stain.

Assessment and Plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines (placement of 18 and 20 gauge lines), prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, VAP precautions, and comments regarding communication and code status."

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   probable multi-focal PNA.
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**7-27**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3066**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4326**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's sridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  Not drainable at present.
   - Continue empiric treatment with clindamycin as well as vanc and Zosyn
   - brief course of increased steroids to attempt to decrease extent of
   neck swelling
   - keep intubated for now; will consider tomorrow
   - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass
   - ENT following
   # Fevers: Low grade temps overnight.  Ddx includes infected neck fluid
   collection (though does not appear infected on CT scan) versus PNA seen
   on CT. WBC rising.  Pt not currently showing signs of sepsis.
   - Con
t expanded antibiotic coverage as above
   - culture today
   - mini BAL
   # Drop in HCT: pt
s Hct was 42 on admission (baseline high 30s), then
   dropped to 27 after getting IVF.  Also, question of blood being drawn
   proximal to IV being run, possibly causing significant hemodilution.
   No e/o gross hemorrhage at present, although pt could have blood in ant
   neck collection.  Hct now stable

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and stridor, and was found to have a fluid collection in the anterior neck following tracheal dilation, as well as probable multi-focal pneumonia (PNA).

The patient's airway compromise and anterior neck collection are suspected to be related to the recent tracheal dilation procedure. The anterior neck collection may be an infectious collection or edema, but it is not drainable at present.

The patient is experiencing low-grade fevers, which could be due to infected neck fluid collection or PNA. The white blood cell (WBC) count is rising, indicating a possible infection. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been expanded, and cultures have been obtained.

There is a drop in the patient's hematocrit (HCT) level from 42 to 27, which could be due to hemodilution from intravenous fluids (IVF) or blood loss in the anterior neck collection. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is stable, and there are no signs of acute kidney injury (ARF) at present.

The patient has a history of postoperative polymorphic VT and is currently on mexiletine for treatment. His diabetes mellitus type II is being managed with insulin.

The patient's cardiovascular status includes a history of CABG, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a controlled ventricular rate, and a recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

The patient's current medications include clindamycin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, as well as other ICU medications such as propofol, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Airway compromise due to subglottic stenosis and anterior neck collection.
2. Infection of the neck fluid collection or multi-focal pneumonia.
3. Acute kidney injury due to pre-renal, intrinsic, or obstructive causes.
4. Cardiac issues related to coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.
5. Neurological complications due to the cerebrovascular accident.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, infection parameters, kidney function, cardiovascular status, and neurological status."

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   possible multi-focal PNA.
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**7-27**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3066**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4326**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's sridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  Not drainable at present.
   - Continue empiric treatment with clindamycin as well as vanc and Zosyn
   - brief course of increased steroids to attempt to decrease extent of
   neck swelling
   - keep intubated for now; will d/w ENT & anesthesia to coordinate
   possible extubation today/tomorrow
   - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass
   - ENT following

   collection (though does not appear infected on CT scan) versus PNA seen
   on CT. WBC rising.  Pt not currently showing signs of sepsis.

   # Drop in HCT: pt
s Hct was 42 on admission (baseline high 30s), then
   dropped to 27 after getting IVF.  Also, question of blood being drawn
   proximal to IV being run, possibly causing significant hemodilution.
   No e/o gross hemorrhage at present, although pt could have blood in ant
   neck collection.  Hct now stable
   -          Trend HCT, appears stable
   -          Guaiac stools
   # CAD: s/p 5 vessel CABG.  CE negative x2 since presentation.  No CP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) complicated by cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and subglottic stenosis. He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and stridor, and was found to have a fluid collection in the anterior neck following tracheal dilation. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway compromise/anterior neck collection: The patient's airway may be compromised due to subglottic stenosis and a recent tracheal dilation procedure. This could lead to stridor and difficulty breathing.
2. Possible multi-focal pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a rising white blood cell count and low-grade fevers, which could indicate an infection. There are also findings on the CT scan suggesting possible pneumonia.
3. Drop in hematocrit (HCT): The patient's HCT has dropped significantly after receiving intravenous fluids. This could be due to hemodilution or blood loss.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CHF and previous CABG surgery. His ejection fraction is reduced at 35-40%. There are plans to restart diuretics, beta-blockers, and statin therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   possible multi-focal PNA.
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**7-27**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3066**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4326**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's sridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  Not drainable at present.
   - Continue empiric treatment with clindamycin as well as vanc and Zosyn
   - brief course of increased steroids to attempt to decrease extent of
   neck swelling
   - keep intubated for now; will d/w ENT & anesthesia to coordinate
   possible extubation today/tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, and subglottic stenosis after multiple intubations. He presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath and stridor and was found to have a fluid collection in the anterior neck following tracheal dilation, as well as possible multi-focal pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: The patient has a history of subglottic stenosis after multiple intubations and underwent tracheal dilation. He now has acute airway compromise, which may be related to the procedure. The anterior neck collection may be due to airway compromise or infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

2. Fevers: The patient has experienced low-grade temperatures overnight. Differential diagnoses include infected neck fluid collection or pneumonia seen on the CT scan. The rising white blood cell (WBC) count supports the possibility of an infection. Monitoring and cultures are recommended to guide treatment decisions.

3. Drop in Hematocrit (HCT): The patient's HCT dropped from 42 on admission to 27 after receiving intravenous fluids (IVF). This could be due to hemodilution from the IV fluids or blood loss into the anterior neck collection. Close monitoring of the HCT levels is advised.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which includes CABG surgery. His cardiac enzymes are negative, and there is no evidence of cardiogenic shock. Restarting beta-blockers, statins, and diuretics is recommended as part of his cardiac care.

5. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)/Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of CHF with a reduced ejection fraction. Restarting diuretics and adjusting medications such as Coreg and lisinopril are necessary to manage his heart failure symptoms.

6. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib)/Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 70s. His International Normalized Ratio (INR) is 1.4. Holding Coumadin for possible procedure and adjusting Coreg dosage are recommended.

7. Postoperative Polymorphic VT: The patient has a history of postoperative polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) treated with mexiletine. Holding mexiletine for now is advised.

8. Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DM II): The patient has DM II, and his management includes insulin therapy (RISS plus lantus) with an increased dose of lantus to be taken at home.

9. Contact/HCP: The patient's wife was contacted and informed about his care."

   tender
   - swelling discussed with ENT, obtained neck u/s with goal to drain any
   fluid collection, discussed with radiology who saw only small shallow
   11mm collection, did not look like abscess and was not amenable to
   draining, recommend following clinically and repeating u/s in [**12-17**] days
   to assess for evolving collection with possible future drainage.
   - Continue to treat with clinda and unasyn for 14 day course.
   - Discussed steroids with ENT team, no indication to continue high dose
   steroids.  Unclear indication for baseline 10mg daily prednisone pt is

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with no known drug allergies. He was successfully extubated yesterday without any events overnight. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, piperacillin, and vancomycin. He is also receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for some noted below. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), a heart rate between 60-135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129-171 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-33 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,377 mL, with 564 mL given through the IVF line. Output includes a total output of 2,380 mL, with 380 mL being blood products. Urine output is also 2,380 mL. 

The patient is not on respiratory support and is using an O2 delivery device. Ventilator mode is CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow with set Vt of 600 mL and RR of 16 breaths per minute. PEEP is set at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 30%, PIP at 22 cmH2O, and plateau pressure at 18 cmH2O. SpO2 is 96% and ABG results are as follows: pH///26, Ve 11.9 L/min. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and some other parameters. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 185 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 11.0 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 158, slightly low potassium (K+) at 1.1 mg/dL, slightly low sodium (Na+) at 26 mEq/L, elevated blood glucose at 329 mg/dL, and other abnormal values. 

Radiology images are attached. 

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation."

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   possible multi-focal PNA.
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**7-27**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3066**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4326**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's sridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  Not drainable at present.
   - Continue empiric treatment with clindamycin as well as vanc and Zosyn
   - brief course of increased steroids to attempt to decrease extent of
   neck swelling
   - keep intubated for now; will d/w ENT & anesthesia to coordinate
   possible extubation today/tomorrow
   - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass
   - ENT following
   # Fevers: Low grade temps overnight.  Ddx includes infected neck fluid
   collection (though does not appear infected on CT scan) versus PNA seen
   on CT. WBC rising.  Pt not currently showing signs of sepsis.
   - Con

   - culture today
   - mini BAL
   # Drop in HCT: pt
s Hct was 42 on admission (baseline high 30s), then
   dropped to 27 after getting IVF.  Also, question of blood being drawn
   proximal to IV being run, possibly causing significant hemodilution.
   No e/o gross hemorrhage at present, although pt could have blood in ant
   neck collection.  Hct now stable
   -          Trend HCT, appears stable
   -          Guaiac stools
   # CAD: s/p 5 vessel CABG.  CE negative x2 since presentation.  No CP.
   - Restarted coreg, aspirin, will resume statin as well since pt has OGT
   # CHF/Cardiomyopathy: last TTE in [**6-23**] w/ EF 35-40%.
   - restart lasix
