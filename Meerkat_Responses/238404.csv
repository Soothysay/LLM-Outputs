","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of colon cancer presenting with hypotension found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/51 mmHg to 108/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

The patient has multiple indwelling lines, including an 18-gauge port-a-cath placed on 09/16/2101 at 01:05 AM. The patient's urine culture was obtained at 04:00 AM on the same day. The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 233 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 105 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient also has leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and low levels of calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension - likely secondary to infection or sepsis.
2. Pain control - acute and chronic pain management.
3. Pyelonephritis - cloudy/turbid urostomy output and elevated WBC count.
4. Goals of care discussion with the patient and family regarding DNR/DNI without escalation.
5. UTI - evidenced by urinalysis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn, ciprofloxacin) initiated.
6. AMS - likely secondary to infection, hypotension, and narcotic pain medication. Monitor and consider head imaging if indicated.
7. Leukocytosis - related to infection or UTI. Monitor WBC count and fever curve. Broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated.
8. L. upper lung mass/collapse - likely exudative from malignancy. Broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated.
9. Widely metastatic colon cancer/severe pain - continue aggressive pain regimen.
10. Anemia - unclear baseline. Monitor HCTs and guaiac all stools.
11. Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel reg.
12. Access: Port-a-cath, 18 gauge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis - due to the presence of hypotension and leukocytosis.
2. Acute kidney injury - secondary to dehydration or urinary tract obstruction.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of colon cancer who presents with hypotension and is found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 96/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including pain control, pyelonephritis, anemia, pleural effusion, and metastatic colon cancer. The assessment and plan include goals for hemodynamic stability, pain management, treatment of UTI, further diagnostic tests, and ongoing monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: Given the presence of hypotension and UTI, there is a risk of developing sepsis if the infection spreads throughout the body.
2. Acute kidney injury: Pyelonephritis can lead to acute kidney injury if not promptly treated.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has limited mobility due to being in the ICU, which increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from medical devices can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on respiratory support, there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with widely metastatic colorectal cancer who presented with hypotension, likely sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been admitted to the MICU and is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 96/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished radial pulses and absent distal pulses. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.4 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 29.3%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 233 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging shows left upper lobe collapse. The patient is currently receiving supportive care for sepsis and further workup is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension and likely sepsis indicates a critical condition. The ongoing discussion of goals of care suggests that the patient's condition is unstable, and sepsis management will continue with antibiotics, fluids, pressors as needed, stress dose steroids, and culture samples.

2. Organ Dysfunction: The laboratory results indicate"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of colon cancer who presented with hypotension and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient's blood pressure is currently in the 80s, indicating hypotension. Other possible causes for the low blood pressure include hypovolemia, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or pulmonary embolism (PE). However, given the cloudy and decreased output of the urostomy, the most likely etiology is infection secondary to the UTI.
- The patient's mental status has fluctuated from alert to somnolent. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, preferably through intravenous fluids (IVF) rather than vasopressors like levophed or norepinephrine, due to tachycardia.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.
- Additional diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray (CXR), computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and urinalysis (u/a) have been ordered.
- The patient has expressed a desire for DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) without escalation, as discussed with his sister.
- The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to infection and hypotension, and monitoring of the WBC count and fever curve is advised.
- The patient's anemia is characterized by a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 91, which is unclear if it is a baseline value. Further evaluation and monitoring are recommended.
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and bowel regimen.
- The patient has an indwelling port-a-cath for medication administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the presence of a UTI and hypotension, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's urostomy output is decreased and cloudy, indicating a possible urinary obstruction or infection that could progress to AKI.

3. Pulmonary complications: The patient's lung mass/collapse may be exudative in nature, potentially due to malignancy. However, it could also represent an infection or parapneumonic effusion. This increases the risk of respiratory failure.

4. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

   # Hypotension-Likely etiologies includes sepsis/infection. Other
   possibilities include hypovolemia vs. ACS vs PE. Most likely etiology
   includes infection secondary to UTI given cloudy/turbid/decreased

   despite BP in 80's.  Was briefly on pressors yesterday but recovered.
   Likely urosepsis.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of colon cancer who presents with hypotension and is found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 105/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals pain, poor dentition, supple neck, diminished breath sounds in both lungs, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2, tachycardia, cloudy urine, and warm extremities with good pulses.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 225 mg/dL, and elevated levels of AST, ALT, and LDH. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's goals of care discussion with his sister reveals a preference for do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status, but he still wants to be treated for reversible conditions. The patient's condition appears to be improving today, with improved pain control and stable respiratory status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with widely metastatic colorectal cancer who presented with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and nephrostomy tube malfunction. He experienced brief hypotension but is now off pressors and doing well. The patient's goals of care are DNR/DNI. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected urosepsis and is being treated for septic shock. The patient also has chronic steroids use, pain management, and aggressive glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient initially presented with a suspected UTI and was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This indicates that there may be a risk of urosepsis, which is a severe infection that spreads through the bloodstream from the urinary tract.
2. Nephrostomy tube malfunction: The patient's presentation included a malfunctioning nephrostomy tube, which can lead to complications such as infection or obstruction.
3. Septic shock: The patient experienced septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure and inadequate organ function.
4. Metastatic colorectal cancer: The patient has widely metastatic colorectal cancer, which increases the risk of various complications related to cancer spread and treatment.
5. Chronic steroids use: The patient's chronic use of steroids may increase the risk of certain side effects or complications, such as immunosuppression, bone loss, and increased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with widely metastatic colorectal cancer presenting with possible urinary tract infection (UTI) and nephrostomy tube malfunction. The patient was briefly on pressors, but now the condition has resolved. The patient's goals of care discussion with the healthcare provider revealed a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

The patient's medical history includes colorectal cancer with metastasis, chronic use of steroids, and depression. Allergies are not reported. The patient received various medications including antibiotics (cefipime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), omeprazole, lidocaine, gabapentin, fentanyl, morphine, hydrocortisone, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, no fever, no abdominal pain, and no dysuria. Vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has an oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a net input of 10,765 mL and output of 6,725 mL.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be in no acute distress, with clear breath sounds, somewhat hard and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities, and minimal right lower extremity edema."
