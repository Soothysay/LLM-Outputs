   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD who
   presents from NH with increased lethargy and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Multiple previous admissions for hypoxia in the setting of
   CHF exacerbation given her profoundly depressed EF and 3+ MR. However,
   CXR today does not appear significantly overloaded; pt does have
   evidence of some overload on exam but is at same weight as at time of
   discharge on her last admission.  Given fever to 103 in ED and
   daughter's report of cough x 1 week, poor clearance of secretions, and
   aspiration risk, concern for PNA although no leukocytosis and no
   obvious infiltrate on CXR; it is possible she is relatively dry (for
   her), and an infiltrate may blossom on repeat CXR after hydration.  No
   wheezing to suggest COPD exacerbation.  PE lower on differential.
   - f/u blood culture
   - obtain sputum cx
   - f/u urine legionella
   - monitor volume status, maintain euvolemia as no obvious evidence of
   significant volume overload on CXR this AM
   -ipratropium nebs Q6
   -continue broad antibiotic coverage with vanc, zosyn
   - wean off O2
   .
   # CHF: EF 25%, 3+ MR. Received both lasix and IV fluids in the ED. Pt
   currently not significantly overloaded with MAP in 70s and adequate
   UOP.
   - re-start lasix (will give 20IV
 1x dose of home equivalent)
   .
   # COPD: Cont ipratropium nebs; holding albuterol nebs for now as above.
   Resume montelukast when able to tolerate po.
   .
   # Fever: Concern for infection although WBC nl.  Ddx includes PNA (as
   above) or UTI (contaminated sample from ED). No septic physiology
   currently; lactate nl.  Ddx for noninfectious etiologies in this pt
   include PE, seizure.
   - Trend temp, WBC
   - F/u bcx, resent u/a and urine cx, sputum cx, urine legionella
   - Consider noninfectious w/u if fever persists and ID w/u unrevealing
   - continue antibiotics
   .
   # AMS/lethargy: [**Month (only) 60**] be altered in the setting of infection or hypoxia.
   Hypercarbia also possible with h/o COPD. Given h/o seizure disorder, it
   is possible that she is having ictal or postictal events. Phenytoin
   level is subtherapeutic. Diabetic but no evidence of hypoglycemia.
   Appears to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] course which would be more c/w
   delirium
   - F/u U/A, cx, and treat possible infection as above
   - Check ABG to see if CO2 retaining
   - Phenytoin IV while NPO, will need to adjust dose per albumin and
   level
   - If mental status is not improving in the AM, consider EEG
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: Phenytoin level subtherapeutic
   - Phenytoin 100mg IV q8h per Pharmacy recs while unable to take po;
   adjust per albumin & level
   - Consider EEG as above
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: RVR to 150s, currently better controlled s/p 1 L
   IVF.  CE baseline.  Dig level is low and INR is subtherapeutic; pt is
   receiving abx which may augment these levels.
   - Resume metoprolol, digoxin, and coumadin when able to take po
   - metoprolol IV if not able to take PO
   - Trend INR
   - Cycle CE, check TSH
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: At baseline. Pt thought to be dry in ED but
   her relatively good Cr suggests baseline renal perfusion
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: EKG stable, elevated trop (at baseline)
   likely related to CRF.
   - Resume aspirin, beta-blocker, statin when able to take po
   .
   # Anemia: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to CRF, multiple myeloma. Hct stable at
   baseline.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC
   84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD who
   presents from NH with increased lethargy and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Multiple previous admissions for hypoxia in the setting of
   CHF exacerbation given her profoundly depressed EF and 3+ MR. However,
   CXR today does not appear significantly overloaded; pt does have
   evidence of some overload on exam but is at same weight as at time of
   discharge on her last admission.  Given fever to 103 in ED and
   daughter's report of cough x 1 week, poor clearance of secretions, and
   aspiration risk, concern for PNA although no leukocytosis and no
   obvious infiltrate on CXR; it is possible she is relatively dry (for
   her), and an infiltrate may blossom on repeat CXR after hydration.  No
   wheezing to suggest COPD exacerbation.  PE lower on differential.
   - Repeat CXR
   - Broad abx for HCAP coverage for now with vanc, zosyn (?aspiration),
   cipro (GN double coverage) but low threshold to stop if no compelling
   evidence
   - Sputum cx, MRSA screen, urine legionella
   - F/u blood cx
   - Monitor volume status for now as below
   - Ipratropium nebs q6h; given afib w/ [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] hold albuterol for now
   - If tachycardia and hypoxia persist, could consider PE w/u
   - Wean off mask ventilation as tolerated
   .
   # CHF: EF 25%, 3+ MR. Received both lasix and IV fluids in the ED. Pt
   currently not significantly overloaded with MAP in 70s and adequate
   UOP. Will allow fluid status to equilibriate and hold on further
   interventions for now.
   .
   # COPD: Cont ipratropium nebs; holding albuterol nebs for now as above.
   Resume montelukast when able to tolerate po.
   .
   # Fever: Concern for infection although WBC nl.  Ddx includes PNA (as
   above) or UTI (contaminated sample from ED). No septic physiology
   currently; lactate nl.  Ddx for noninfectious etiologies in this pt
   include PE, seizure.
   - Trend temp, WBC
   - F/u bcx, resent u/a and urine cx, sputum cx, urine legionella
   - Consider noninfectious w/u if fever persists and ID w/u unrevealing
   .
   # AMS/lethargy: [**Month (only) 60**] be altered in the setting of infection or hypoxia.
   Hypercarbia also possible with h/o COPD. Given h/o seizure disorder, it
   is possible that she is having ictal or postictal events. Phenytoin
   level is subtherapeutic.
   - F/u U/A, cx, and treat possible infection as above
   - Check ABG
   - Phenytoin IV while NPO, will need to adjust dose per albumin and
   level
   - If mental status is not improving in the AM, consider EEG
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: Phenytoin level subtherapeutic
   - Phenytoin 100mg IV q8h per Pharmacy recs while unable to take po;
   adjust per albumin & level
   - Consider EEG as above
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: [**Month (only) **] to 150s, currently better controlled s/p 1 L
   IVF.  CE baseline.  Dig level is low and INR is subtherapeutic; pt is
   receiving abx which may augment these levels.
   - Pt received meds at NH today
   - Restart metoprolol, dig, coumadin
   - Resume metoprolol, digoxin, and coumadin when able to take po
   - Trend INR
   - Cycle CE, check TSH
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: At baseline. Pt thought to be dry in ED but
   her relatively good Cr suggests baseline renal perfusion
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: EKG stable, elevated trop (at baseline)
   likely related to CRF.
   - Resume aspirin, beta-blocker, statin when able to take po
   .
   # Anemia: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to CRF, multiple myeloma. Hct stable at
   baseline.
   - Trend
   .
   # Multiple myeloma:
   - Trend creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now given MS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   Access: Peripherals
   .
   Code: DNR/DNI - pressors ok but no CVL (confirmed with HCP). Goals of
   care (e.g. whether to rehospitalize in future) need to be readdressed
   with family; consider palliative care consult.

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), multiple myeloma (MM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presents with increased lethargy, hypoxia, and fever.

The assessment and plan include hypoxemia, altered mental status (not delirium), and heart failure (CHF), diastolic, chronic. The patient has a profoundly depressed ejection fraction (EF) and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Pneumonia (PNA): Given the patient's fever, cough, poor clearance of secretions, and aspiration risk, there is a concern for PNA. Although no leukocytosis and no obvious infiltrate on the chest X-ray are present, it is possible that the patient may develop an infiltrate after hydration.

2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: Although no wheezing is reported, the patient has a history of COPD, and there is a possibility of COPD exacerbation.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin as prophylaxis against DVT.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The urine culture was obtained at 01:21 AM, and the patient's urine output has been low. UTI is a possibility, especially considering the contaminated sample from the emergency department.

5. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizures, and her mental status may be due to an ictal or postictal event. Phenytoin level is subtherapeutic.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is AFib, and her baseline Digoxin level is low, and INR is subtherapeutic. Antibiotics may augment these levels.

7. Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is relatively stable, suggesting baseline renal perfusion.

8. Coronary artery disease: The patient's EKG is stable, with elevated troponin levels, which are likely related to chronic renal failure.

9. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable at baseline.

10. Multiple myeloma: The patient's condition may be related to multiple myeloma.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration or new complications and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

","Summary:
The patient presented with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/64 mmHg to 88/26 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.39, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 630, and PaCO2 of 40 mmHg. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and low potassium levels. The patient's condition has improved significantly since the previous day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest a possible infection. However, there is no clear evidence of an infectious etiology based on the provided information.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of chronic diastolic heart failure may contribute to their current condition. However, there are no significant signs of heart failure on the chest X-ray or examination.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could potentially be delirium. However,"

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a chief complaint of waxing and waning mental status. She has a history of allergies to Zestril (Lisinopril) and has been receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and dilantin. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), blood pressure ranging from 118/67 to 92/51 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Fluid balance shows a net loss of 1005 mL. The patient's blood work reveals normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. The patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to the use of indwelling lines and the presence of NG tubes, which can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and"

   setting of CHF exacerbation although on this admission did not appear
   significantly volume overloaded clinically or by chest film.  Reports
   cough x1 week, fever of 103 in the ED, poor clearance of secretions and
   aspiration risk (although no consolidation on film) so covered for
   PNA.  Patient low risk by [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] Criteria for PE.
   - f/u blood culture
   - obtain sputum cx
   - monitor volume status, maintain euvolemia as no obvious evidence of
   significant volume overload on CXR this AM
   -ipratropium nebs Q6
   -continue broad antibiotic coverage with vanc, zosyn
   - wean off O2
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Likely due to reduced PO intake, free water deficit
   2.3L.
   - 100cc/hr D5W for 24hrs
   - Q6-8hr Na
   .
   # CHF: EF 25%, 3+ MR.  Have been holding PO lasix in the setting AMS.
   - consider restart lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # COPD:
   - Cont ipratropium nebs; holding albuterol nebs for now as above.
   - continue montelukast
   .
   # AMS/lethargy: [**Month (only) 60**] be altered in the setting of infection or hypoxia.
   Hypercarbia also possible with h/o COPD. Given h/o seizure disorder, it
   is possible that she is having ictal or postictal events. Phenytoin
   level is subtherapeutic. Diabetic but no evidence of hypoglycemia.
   Appears to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] course which would be more c/w
   delirium.   After discussion with family appears that this is not acute
   event but may be baseline waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 42**] mental status.
   - F/u U/A, CX and treat possible infection as above
   - continue phenytoin
   - correct hypernatremia
   - If mental status is not improving in the AM, consider EEG
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: Phenytoin level subtherapeutic
   - Phenytoin 100mg IV q8h and change to home dose PO when able to
   tolerate
   - Consider EEG as above
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: RVR to 150s, currently better controlled s/p 1 L
   IVF.  CE baseline.  INR is subtherapeutic but Coumadin has been held
   given concern that antibiotics may augment these levels.
   - continue metoprolol, digoxin (dosed twice weekly)
   - consider restart coumadin at home dose
   - metoprolol IV if not able to take PO
   - Trend INR
   .
   # Fever: Concern for infection although WBC nl.  Ddx includes PNA (as
   above) or UTI (contaminated sample from ED). No septic physiology
   currently; lactate nl.  Ddx for noninfectious etiologies in this pt
   include PE, seizure.
   - Trend temp, WBC
   - F/u bcx, resent u/a and urine cx, sputum cx
   - Consider noninfectious w/u if fever persists and ID w/u unrevealing
   - continue antibiotics
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: At baseline. Pt thought to be dry in ED but
   her relatively good Cr suggests baseline renal perfusion
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: EKG stable, elevated trop (at baseline)
   likely related to CRF.
   - Resume aspirin, beta-blocker,
   - Restart atovastatin
   .
   # Anemia: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to CRF, multiple myeloma. Hct stable at
   baseline.
   - Trend
   .
   # Multiple myeloma:
   - Trend creatinine and electrolytes

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with increased lethargy and hypoxia, but without significant volume overload on chest X-ray. She has been admitted multiple times for hypoxia related to CHF exacerbation. She reports cough and fever, and has poor clearance of secretions with an aspiration risk. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is at low risk for pulmonary embolism. She will be monitored for volume status, and euvolemia will be maintained. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued, and weaning off oxygen as tolerated will be considered.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient likely has a free water deficit of 2.3 L. If her sodium level is elevated, she will receive 100 cc/hr D5W for 24 hours. Frequent Na checks and free water administration will be done.

3. CHF: The patient has a low ejection fraction of 25% and significant mitral regurgitation. She will be evaluated for fluid status this afternoon, and Lasix 40mg will be considered.

4. COPD: The patient will continue with ipratropium nebs and"

The patient's vital signs are currently stable with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/64 mmHg to 105/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is also experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, which have been addressed with fluid bolus and beta-blocker administration. The patient has received Lasix to manage fluid overload. Her labs show elevated potassium levels, low sodium levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's blood cultures and sensitivity tests have been ordered. She is currently on respiratory support with SpO2 at 100%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure may lead to worsening of cardiac function, resulting in further hypotension and fluid overload.
2. Infection: The patient's altered mental status, coupled with her hypoxemia and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension and atrial fibrillation. She was called out to the floor but became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s. A fluid bolus was administered, and her blood pressure improved to the 90s and 100s. The patient remains in atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate ranging from 110s to 140s intermittently. She was given a home dose of beta blocker, which improved control to the 90s. The patient's oxygen saturation is in the mid-90s on 3L NC and respiratory rate is in the 20s. A chest X-ray revealed worsening fluid overload, for which 20 IV lasix was written.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low systolic blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rapid atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of clot formation and subsequent embolic events such as stroke.
3. Fluid Overload: The worsening fluid overload seen on the chest X-ray increases the risk of pulmonary edema and cardiac dysfunction.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (high potassium), which can affect various bodily functions and organ perfusion.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to multiple factors such as hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalances, or the underlying medical conditions. It requires close monitoring for potential deterioration.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary for accurate assessment and treatment planning."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD who
   presents from NH with increased lethargy and hypoxia.
   .
   # Shortness of breath:  Documented fever of 103.4 in ED with O2 sat of
   83%RA, aspiration risk due to poor clearance of secretions and new
   cough concerning for pulmonary infection (although no clear infiltrate
   on CXR) so treated for possible HCAP with vancomycin and zosyn.  She
   has had multiple prior admissions for hypoxia in the setting of CHF
   exacerbation, initially euvolemic volume status now appears volume
   overloaded clinically and on imaging.  Also with history of COPD.
   - Lasix for net negative fluid balance 500
 1000cc today
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for HCAP
   - wean off O2 as tolerated
   .
   # CHF: Most recent echo ([**2119**]) notable for EF 25%, [**Year (4 digits) 4877**] to severe
   MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4877**] pulmonary hypertension.  Appears volume overloaded
   clinically and on imaging with worsening pleural effusion.  Home dose
   lasix (40 [**Hospital1 **]) has been held in the setting of borderline blood
   pressure.
   - goal net negative 500-1000cc/hr with IV Lasix
   - .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium of 149 on [**2121-3-1**] likely due to reduced PO
   intake, free water deficit 2.3L. Given D5W with correction.
   .
   # COPD:
   - Cont ipratropium nebs; holding albuterol nebs for now as above.
   - continue montelukast
   .
   # AMS/lethargy: [**Month (only) 60**] be altered in the setting of infection or hypoxia.
   Hypercarbia also possible with h/o COPD. Given h/o seizure disorder, it
   is possible that she is having ictal or postictal events. Phenytoin
   level is subtherapeutic. Diabetic but no evidence of hypoglycemia.
   Appears to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] course which would be more c/w
   delirium.   After discussion with family appears that this is not acute
   event but may be baseline waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 42**] mental status.
   - F/u U/A, CX and treat possible infection as above
   - continue phenytoin
   - correct hypernatremia
   - mental status improving this morning
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: Phenytoin level subtherapeutic
   - Phenytoin 100mg IV q8h and change to home dose PO when able to
   tolerate
   - Consider EEG if mental status does not clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: RVR to 150s, currently better controlled s/p 1 L
   IVF.  CE baseline.  INR is subtherapeutic but Coumadin has been held
   given concern that antibiotics may augment these levels.
   - continue metoprolol with hold parameters
   - continue digoxin 0.125 on Tuesday and Saturday
   - continue coumadin at home dose
   - Trend INR
   .
   # Fever: Concern for infection although WBC nl.  Ddx includes PNA (as
   above) or UTI (contaminated sample from ED). No septic physiology
   currently; lactate nl.  Ddx for noninfectious etiologies in this pt
   include PE, seizure.
   - Trend temp, WBC
   - F/u bcx, resent u/a and urine cx, sputum cx
   - Consider noninfectious w/u if fever persists and ID w/u unrevealing
   - continue antibiotics

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxia. The patient has been treated for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, but her heart rate has improved with the administration of a beta-blocker. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, ranging from the 80s to the 100s systolic. She has received fluid boluses and diuretics to manage her hypotension and fluid overload. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, which may be due to an infection, hypoxia, or hypercarbia. She has a history of seizures and is on phenytoin, but her levels are subtherapeutic. The patient's sodium level is high, likely due to reduced PO intake and free water deficit. She has been given D5W for correction.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the hospital with increased lethargy and shortness of breath. She has been treated for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. Her vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. She is also experiencing worsening fluid overload, as evidenced by her physical examination and imaging.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient has a documented fever and low oxygen saturation, which raises concern for a pulmonary infection. Despite being treated for HCAP, there is no clear infiltrate on the chest X-ray. Continuous monitoring and assessment of her respiratory status are necessary.
2. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's history of CHF and the presence of worsening pleural effusion suggest an exacerbation of her heart failure. Fluid restriction and cautious diuresis should be continued to manage her volume status.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Close monitoring of her heart rate and rhythm is essential. Medications such as metoprolol and digoxin may need to be adjusted to"

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She was admitted to the hospital and found to have pulmonary edema. She was later transferred to the MICU due to similar symptoms but has since improved. However, she developed [Last Name (LF) 2245], and her condition required her to stay in the MICU. 

The patient has a history of allergies to Zestril (Lisinopril), cough, and antibiotic use including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin. She is currently on various medications such as Heparin Sodium, atrovent, famotidine, singular, asa, lopressor 37.5, lipitor, coumadin, and dilantin.

Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/81 mmHg to 111/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The flowsheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient's fluid intake and output are within normal limits. She is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula and her ABG results are normal.
