   55F with metastatic breast cancer c/b malignant pericardial and pleural
   effusions presenting with worsening shortness of breath found to have
   superinfection of the pleural effusions versus PNA with parapneumonic
   effusion / empyema. Overnight on [**1-2**] BCx grew GPCs in pairs and
   chains and pleural fluid Gram stain was notably for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.
   # Shortness of breath.  Ddx includes pericardial effusion, pleural
   effusion with empyema, pneumonia, PE. Most likely culprit is PNA with
   empyema, especially given the pt's report of interval improvement after
   initial thoracentesis. Pt also has some degree of underlying fibrosis
   likely from prior radiation. Has been followed as an outpatient for a
   known restrictive lung defect.
   -Supplemental 02 prn
   -care as below for empyema/PNA
   -appreciate IP involvement, continue to f/u recs
   -At this point consider PE less likely given other more compelling dx,
   but will keep in mind given presence of malignancy if pt persistently
   tachycardic/dyspneic/hypoxic.
   # Epmyema/PNA - Pt with marked leukocytosis with L shift and GPCs in
   pleural fluid c/w empyema and GPC growing in BCx in less that 12
   hours.  Also has CXR c/w PNA.  Unclear if pt has underlying compressive
   fibrosis/metastatic disease predisposing her to obstruction and a
   higher liklihood of anaerobic infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged to elderly woman with metastatic breast cancer, presenting with worsening shortness of breath. She has a history of malignant pericardial and pleural effusions, and is currently being treated for superinfection of the pleural effusions versus PNA with parapneumonic effusion / empyema. The patient's condition has improved somewhat overnight, with respiratory rates trending down from near 30 to the teens, but she remains tachycardic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a history of malignant pericardial effusion and a recent worsening of the effusion. There is a possibility of purulent pericardial effusion, which could lead to cardiac tamponade if not treated promptly.
2. Empyema/Pneumonia: The patient has a superinfection of the pleural effusions, which may progress to empyema or pneumonia if not appropriately treated.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although less likely at this time, the presence of malignancy increases the risk of PE. If the patient persists with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypoxia, PE should be considered.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, with readings ranging from 161/86 mmHg to 103/73 mmHg. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure"

","The patient is a middle-aged to elderly woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer, presenting with worsening shortness of breath and respiratory failure. She has undergone thoracentesis, which helped alleviate symptoms. The respiratory dysfunction may be related to underlying malignancy and possibly restrictive lung disease.

The patient is currently on vancomycin and cefepime empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), pending culture results. If there is clinical deterioration, the antibiotics may be broadened to include anaerobic coverage. Supplemental oxygen is provided as needed.

Considering the involvement of the pleural effusion and the patient's persistent tachycardia, hypoxia, and leukocytosis, it is important to monitor for purulent pericardial effusion and consider pericardiocentesis if necessary. Telemetry and thoracic imaging will be done to assess the pericardial window.

The patient's tachycardia may be related to acute infection, so appropriate treatment for the infection will be given, along with IV fluid boluses as needed for low urine output. If the tachycardia persists after treating the empyema, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) may be considered to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's hypertension is usually managed with a low dose beta-blocker at home, but it will be held during the acute infection. Breast cancer treatment with Herceptin and Adriamycin will"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with metastatic breast cancer c/b malignant pericardial and pleural
   effusions presenting with worsening shortness of breath found to have
   superinfection of the pleural effusions versus PNA with parapneumonic
   effusion / empyema. Overnight on [**1-2**] BCx grew GPCs in pairs and
   chains and pleural fluid Gram stain was notably for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.
   # Shortness of breath.  Ddx includes pericardial effusion, pleural
   effusion with empyema, pneumonia, PE. Most likely culprit is PNA with
   empyema, especially given the pt's report of interval improvement after
   initial thoracentesis. Pt also has some degree of underlying fibrosis
   likely from prior radiation. Has been followed as an outpatient for a
   known restrictive lung defect.
   -Supplemental 02 prn
   -care as below for empyema/PNA
   -appreciate IP involvement, continue to f/u recs
   -At this point consider PE less likely given other more compelling dx,
   but will keep in mind given presence of malignancy if pt persistently
   tachycardic/dyspneic/hypoxic.
   # Epmyema/PNA - Pt with marked leukocytosis with L shift and GPCs in
   pleural fluid c/w empyema and GPC growing in BCx in less that 12
   hours.  Also has CXR c/w PNA.  Unclear if pt has underlying compressive
   fibrosis/metastatic disease predisposing her to obstruction and a
   higher liklihood of anaerobic infection.
   -IP was able to drain a small amount of fluid but deferred a chest tube
   [**12-24**] loculated, non-flowing pleural fluid believed to be from loculation
   of malignant effusion
   - Initial Gram stain of pleural fluid with GPC in pairs and clusters.
   Culture pending
   - Initial BCx grew GPC in pairs and chains. Speciation pending
   - F/u blood, sputum, and pleural fluid cultures
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime for empyema and HAP. Consider narrowing ABx
   - f/u CXR in am
   # Pericardial Effusion - pt has history of malignant pericardial
   effusion s/p pericardial window. In setting of dyspnea/tachycardia and
   hypoxia, repeat [**Month/Day (2) **] showed newly worsened effusion, albeit loculated.
   Unusual for pericardial window to fail this soon, however may be that
   pt's loculated effusion does not communicate with window.  [**Name2 (NI) 317**] slight
   increase in pericardial pressures, however BP stable.  Unlikely that
   this is causing significant tamponade.
   -monitor clinically for now
   -if pt's dyspnea, tachycardia and hypoxia and leukocytosis do not
   improve with above treatment or if decompensates, must consider
   possibility of purulent pericardial effusion and need for urgent
   pericardiocentesis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged to elderly woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with worsening shortness of breath and was found to have a superinfection of the pleural effusions versus PNA with parapneumonic effusion/empyema. The patient's vital signs are stable with blood pressures in the 140s/70 and pulse around 120. However, she is tachycardic and has a respiratory rate in the high 20s.

The patient's physical examination reveals multiple scabs on her shins, hands, scalp, and self-inflicted wounds. There are extensive radiation changes and difficulty appreciating neck veins due to previous axillary lymph node dissection and placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient also has evidence of venous distention on her left superficial thoracic wall veins.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a left shift and growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs and chains from blood cultures, indicating a bacterial infection. The pleural fluid analysis also shows GPC in pairs and clusters. Imaging studies suggest a loculated, non-flowing pleural fluid believed to be from loculation of malignant effusion.

Assessment and plan include treating the patient for empyema and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's shortness of breath may be due to"

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   As recorded in above note.
   Physical Examination
   As recorded. Periods of respiratory distress and increasing lethargy.
   Medical Decision Making
   family meeting today with detailed review of clinical and ethical
   situation.  I explained current medical picture and prognosis based on
   opinions from oncology and pulmonary. It was agreed that intubation or
   CPR was not appropriate given highly unlikely benefit in either acute
   medical condition or overall prognosis.  All of the famioly's questions
   were answered in presence of palliative care and social services.
   Plan for now is continue therapy for current infection and provide
   oxygen and medication for discomfort as needed. She will not be
   intubated, have chest compressions, or receive pressors or
   antiarrhythmioc drugs in event of life threatening cardiac event.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health
   care proxy. Progress reviewed extensively during family meeting.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged elderly woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer, presenting with worsening shortness of breath and respiratory failure/empyema. She has a history of malignant pericardial effusion and a loculated effusion, which may be related to a previous pericardial window. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to acute infection, and she has hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a history of congestive heart failure with decreased systolic function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/empyema: The patient's respiratory distress and high respiratory rate indicate a possible respiratory failure due to empyema. Thoracentesis helped alleviate symptoms, but further treatment is needed. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated empirically, pending culture results. If the patient's condition deteriorates, adding anaerobic coverage may be necessary.
2. Malignant pericardial effusion: The patient has a history of malignant pericardial effusion, and a loculated effusion has been identified. Monitoring the patient's symptoms and clinical parameters is crucial. If there is no improvement or if the patient shows signs of purulent pericardial effusion, pericardiocentesis may be required.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to acute infection. Treating the infection and providing IV fluids as needed should help"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  55F with metastatic breast cancer c/b malignant
   pericardial and pleural effusions presenting with worsening shortness
   of breath.
   # Respiratory failure/empyema - Thoracentesis initially helped
   symptoms.  Respiratory dysfunction likely related to underlying
   malignancy and pleural effusion, ? restrictive lung disease.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Cefepime empirically for HAP, pending speciation
   of cultures, minimum course for 2 weeks to complete on [**2199-1-9**].
   Broaden with anaerobic coverage if clinical deterioration.
   -Supplemental 02 prn
   -appreciate IP involvement, continue to f/u recs
   -At this point consider PE less likely given other more compelling dx,
   but will keep in mind given presence of malignancy if pt persistently
   tachycardic/dyspneic/hypoxic.
   - Appreciate IP input and help with catheter placement
   # Pericardial Effusion - pt has history of malignant pericardial
   effusion s/p pericardial window. In setting of dyspnea/tachycardia and
   hypoxia, repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] showed newly worsened effusion, albeit loculated,
   may be related to pericardial window not communicating with loculated
   space.
   -monitor clinically for now
   -if pt's dyspnea, tachycardia and hypoxia and leukocytosis do not
   improve with above treatment or if decompensates, must consider
   possibility of purulent pericardial effusion and need for
   pericardiocentesis
   -telemetry
   -thoracics to see for ? repeat window.
   # Tachycardia - Likely in setting of acute infection.  Plan to tx
   infection and bolus IVF prn for low UOP.  If doesn't resolve with
   appropriate tx of empyema, consider CTA for r/o PE, although unlikely
   that pt has multiple dx.
   #  HTN - Usually on fairly low dose BB at home. Hold for now in setting
   of acute infection
   # Breast Cancer - On Herceptin and adriamycin.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7873**] is primary
   oncologist.  Last seen [**12-17**].
   -email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7873**], make aware that she is here and update re her status
   -potential call out to OMED when confident pericardial effusion is
   stable without need to drain.
   -pain control with home fentanyl patch and prn oxycodone with morphine
   IV for breakthrough.
   -On cycle [**2-24**] XRT for hip mets today, last session was to be tomorrow.
   Called RT, they feel she may miss a day and will touch base with them
   when pt stable for tx east for further tx.
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home dose levoxyl.
   -given tachycardia, repeat TSH this admission.
   # CHF - on [**Name (NI) **] pt had decreased systolic function with EF 35-40%, with
   moderate LV global hypokinesis. Slightly worse than [**8-29**].  ? whether
   related to chemotherapy, was on doxorubicin previously.
   -caution with IVF
   -consider ACEI instead of BB for BP control on d/c.
   -Recommend outpatient [**Month/Year (2) **] to follow.
   FEN: Regular diet with ensure supplements once IP places catheter.
   Bolus 500cc for low UOP, caution with decreased EF.   Replete lytes
   PRN.
   ACCESS: PICC
   PROPHYLAXIS: Hep SC, bowel regimen.
   CODE: FULL, discussed with patient.
   DISPO: CCU for now, when pericardial effusion stable, call out to OMED.

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer, presenting with worsening shortness of breath. She has a history of malignant pericardial and pleural effusions. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 146/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. She is receiving supplemental oxygen as needed.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PCV+ mode, set at a pressure control of 20 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.12, PaCO2 of 109 mmHg, PaO2 of 98, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 196.

Physical examination reveals alopecia with multiple scabs, extensive radiation changes, difficulty appreciating neck veins, no distention noted, and evidence of venous distention on the left superficial thoracic wall veins. There is also swelling of the right breast, chronic, and decreased breath sounds on the right side more than the left. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or masses.

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged to elderly woman with metastatic breast cancer, presenting with worsening shortness of breath and respiratory failure. She has a history of malignant pericardial and pleural effusions, and cultures growing staph aureus. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxia. Her laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated WBC count, and elevated creatinine levels. The physical examination reveals alopecia, multiple scabs, extensive radiation changes, and evidence of venous distention. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and cefepime. The plan is to continue vancomycin and broaden coverage with anaerobic coverage if there is clinical deterioration. Supplemental oxygen and morphine are also administered as needed. The patient's DNR/DNI status was agreed upon during a family meeting. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and respiratory failure indicate a potential complication related to her underlying malignancy and pleural effusion, possibly restrictive lung disease.
2. Infection: The presence of staph aureus in cultures suggests a bacterial infection, which could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a history of malignant pericardial effusion and a newly worsened effusion, which may be related to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who presented with malignant pericardial and pleural effusions. She has worsening shortness of breath and is experiencing respiratory failure/empyema. Cultures have grown Staphylococcus aureus, and she is currently being treated with vancomycin. The plan is to continue vancomycin for a minimum of two weeks, broaden the coverage if there is clinical deterioration, and provide supplemental oxygen as needed. The patient also has a history of malignant pericardial effusion and has had a pericardial window placed. She appears stable but may require monitoring in telemetry. She is experiencing tachycardia, which is multifactorial, and her blood pressure is in the 140s/80s. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. She has a history of hypertension but is currently not on medication due to acute infection. She is on Herceptin and adriamycin for her breast cancer. She had a previous episode of congestive heart failure with a decreased ejection fraction of 35-40% and moderate left ventricular global hypokinesis. It is unclear if this is related to chemotherapy or previous doxorubicin use. The patient's respiratory dysfunction is likely related to her underlying malignancy and pleural effusion, possibly restrictive lung disease. The plan is to monitor her intake and output, continue IV fluids as needed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer presenting with malignant pericardial and pleural effusions. She is experiencing worsening shortness of breath.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure/empyema: The patient has respiratory dysfunction, which may be related to her underlying malignancy and possible restrictive lung disease. She requires supplemental oxygen and broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
2. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a history of malignant pericardial effusion and has a newly worsened effusion. If her symptoms do not improve with treatment or if she deteriorates, a pericardiocentesis may be necessary.
3. Tachycardia: The patient is tachycardic, likely due to an acute infection. Treating the infection and fluid boluses may help resolve the issue. If not, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) may be considered to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, and her usual medication is being held in the setting of acute infection.
5. Breast cancer: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer and may require further oncology consultations and interventions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 140s/80s, pulse in the 130s, temperature within normal range, respiratory rate at 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as other medications.

The patient has a history of pleural effusion and empyema, impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelets, and some abnormal values in liver function tests and electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Infection: The presence of empyema suggests a potential infection, which could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient is on heparin prophylaxis, indicating a risk for blood clots. If a clot were to form and travel, it could result in a pulmonary embolism or other thromboembolic events.
3. Fluid imbalance: The fluid balance chart shows an intake of 1,050 mL and output of 200 mL since midnight, resulting in a balance of 850 mL. This may indicate a fluid overload or deficit, which needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.
4. Respiratory compromise: The patient is on mechanical"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  55F with metastatic breast cancer c/b malignant
   pericardial and pleural effusions presenting with worsening shortness
   of breath.
   # Respiratory failure/empyema - Thoracentesis helped symptoms.
   Respiratory dysfunction also may be related to underlying malignancy
   and ? restrictive lung disease.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Cefepime empirically for HAP, pending speciation
   of cultures, minimum course for 2 weeks to complete on [**2199-1-9**].
   Broaden with anaerobic coverage if clinical deterioration.
   -Supplemental 02 prn
   -appreciate IP involvement, continue to f/u recs
   -At this point consider PE less likely given other more compelling dx,
   but will keep in mind given presence of malignancy if pt persistently
   tachycardic/dyspneic/hypoxic.
   - Appreciate IP input and help with catheter placement
   # Pericardial Effusion - pt has history of malignant pericardial
   effusion s/p pericardial window. In setting of dyspnea/tachycardia and
   hypoxia, repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] showed newly worsened effusion, albeit loculated,
   may be related to pericardial window not communicating with loculated
   space.
   -monitor clinically for now
   -if pt's dyspnea, tachycardia and hypoxia and leukocytosis do not
   improve with above treatment or if decompensates, must consider
   possibility of purulent pericardial effusion and need for
   pericardiocentesis
   -telemetry
   -thoracics to see for ? repeat window.
   # Tachycardia - Likely in setting of acute infection.  Plan to tx
   infection and bolus IVF prn for low UOP.  If doesn't resolve with
   appropriate tx of empyema, consider CTA for r/o PE, although unlikely
   that pt has multiple dx.
   #  HTN - Usually on fairly low dose BB at home. Hold for now in setting
   of acute infection
   # Breast Cancer - On Herceptin and adriamycin.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7873**] is primary
   oncologist.  Last seen [**12-17**].
   -email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7873**], make aware that she is here and update re her status
   -potential call out to OMED when confident pericardial effusion is
   stable without need to drain.
   -pain control with home fentanyl patch and prn oxycodone with morphine
   IV for breakthrough.
   -On cycle [**2-24**] XRT for hip mets today, last session was to be tomorrow.
   Called RT, they feel she may miss a day and will touch base with them
   when pt stable for tx east for further tx.
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home dose levoxyl.
   -given tachycardia, repeat TSH this admission.
   # CHF - on [**Name (NI) **] pt had decreased systolic function with EF 35-40%, with
   moderate LV global hypokinesis. Slightly worse than [**8-29**].  ? whether
   related to chemotherapy, was on doxorubicin previously.
   -caution with IVF
   -consider ACEI instead of BB for BP control on d/c.
   -Recommend outpatient [**Month/Year (2) **] to follow.
   FEN: Regular diet with ensure supplements once IP places catheter.
   Bolus 500cc for low UOP, caution with decreased EF.   Replete lytes
   PRN.
   ACCESS: PICC
   PROPHYLAXIS: Hep SC, bowel regimen.
   CODE: FULL, discussed with patient.
