   HPI: 66 M with CAD s/p MI [**2172**] medically managed, CHF EF35% COPD on
   home O2 2L, DM2 on insulin, non-small cell lung cancer who presented
   with acute on chronic cholecystitis on [**2177-11-30**], now s/p open
   cholecystectomy. The following history is obtained from the medical
   record. He was originially admitted on [**11-25**] and disharged [**11-27**] with
   ?cholecystis. He was then seen in surgery clinic where it was decided
   to readmit the patient for cholecystectomy; Cipro and Flagyl were also
   started. He was seen in cardiology clinic for pre-op evaluation, where
   it was advised to hold plavix.
   .
   In the OR: The patient received cefazolin and flagyl. He also received
   hydrocortisone 100mg IV prior to surgery as he had been on prednisone
   one month ago - by had not been on it for the past month. Lap chole was
   attempted with conversion to open cholecystectomy. The case lasted 2
   hrs with minimal blood loss. Towards the end of the case his blood
   pressures dropped to SBP 90-100's, started on neo. UOP remained good at
   325cc for the whole case.

   ECHO [**2177-12-1**]; There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with thinning and akinesis of the inferior and
   inferolateral walls. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis.  Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate
   focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with prior
   inferior/inferolateral infarction. The RV is not well seen but is
   probably slightly dilated/hypokinetic. Moderate tricuspid and mitral
   regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

He underwent an open cholecystectomy.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. He received 60mg IV Lasix last night with good urine response and received an additional 20mg IV Lasix this morning. The patient tolerated well when switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) 12/5/50%. This morning, PEEP was increased to 8, FiO2 was decreased to the 40s, and the patient's saturation levels were in the low 90s. He continues to be sedated and is not arousable to voice commands at this time.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/52 to 154/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's heart rhythm is AV paced, and he has received a total inflow of 3,731 mL and outflow of 2,325 mL since midnight.

   Assessment and Plan
 POSTOPERATIVE S/P OPEN CCY:  Doesn't appear to be in pain. Plan for
   pain control per medical resident's note.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACTUE ON CHRONIC:  Maintained on MV given volume
   overload in setting of underlying oxygen dependent COPD.  Diuresed with
   lasix, negative about 1L this morning.  Was tachypneic breathing in
   high 30's this morning on 12 PSV/5 PEEP, unable to assess autoPEEP in
   this setting albeit concerned for increased work of breathing with
   underlying COPD - PEEP increased to 8 (ETT 7.5), rate settled to
   mid-teens, appears much more comfortable.  Anticipate extubation later
   today once more awake.  Continue bronchodilators.  On 40 mg propofol,
   not responsive.  Need to decrease sedation,
 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Tolerating diuresis this morning, known EF
   ~ 35%.  Hold on further lasix.  Repleting K/Mg. Repeat labs in the
   afternoon.  Will discuss restarting afterload reduction with surgical
   service as well as beta blocker given his blood pressure has been
   stable.
 CAD:  Holding plavix perioperatively.  On ASA.
 DIABETES:  Glargine dropped to half dose, getting RISS.  BS ~ 160's.
   NPO pending extubation and in setting of surgical status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, non-small cell lung cancer, and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35% and an implanted automated internal cardiac defibrillator (AICD). The patient presented with acute on chronic cholecystitis and underwent an open cholecystectomy. He was found to have a new volume overload on chest X-ray and was intubated due to failed spontaneous breathing trial. The patient's current medications include ASA, Plavix (held), simvastatin, ezetimibe, carvedilol (held), and insulin for diabetes. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/50 mmHg to 147/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of pH 7.43, PaCO2 46 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 126, and bicarbonate level of 26 mEq/L. The patient's laboratory values show an elevated white blood cell count of 257 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, blood glucose level of 167 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 m"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and non-small cell lung cancer. The patient presented with acute on chronic cholecystitis and underwent an open cholecystectomy.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/50 to 147/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 50% FiO2. The patient's weight is currently 146.5 kg.

The physical examination reveals small but reactive pupils, no jugular venous distention (JVD) but difficult to assess due to obesity, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs, soft abdomen with no masses or organomegaly, and clean, non-bloody bandage on the surgical incision site.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal kidney function. Imaging studies demonstrate new volume overload on chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include ongoing mechanical ventilation, close monitoring"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), s/p myocardial infarction (MI) in [**2172**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen (O2) at 2L, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) on insulin, and non-small cell lung cancer who presented with acute-on-chronic cholecystitis on [**2177-11-30**]. The patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and was found to have volume overload on chest X-ray (CXR). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate (HR) of 74 bpm within normal limits, blood pressure (BP) of 121/53 mmHg with some fluctuation, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute within normal limits, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) pH of 7.39/53/71/28/5.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.1%, platelet (Plt) count of 257, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) of 112 mg/dL, and other electrolyte levels within normal ranges. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, with a PT of 15.0, PTT of 28.2, and INR of 1.3.

The patient's plan includes maintaining ventilation tonight due to new volume overload on CXR, extubation if tolerated, the possibility of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) after extubation, administration of Lasix 20mg IV this morning for diuresis as BP tolerates, and aiming for O2 sats between 91-93%. The patient's COPD medications will be restarted once extubated. The patient's CHF medications, including gentle diuresis as BP tolerates, checking lytes, repleating as necessary, continuing Captopril 6.25mg daily, and holding Carvedilol for now, will be continued. The patient's DM medications will be adjusted accordingly. The patient's CAD medications, including ASA 81 mg and restarting simvastatin, ezetimibe, and carvedilol today if PO tolerated, will be restarted. The patient's non-small cell lung cancer will be followed up with an oncologist.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and is planned for extubation once stable. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), fluid overload, and complications related to diabetes, COP"

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Adequately controlled,
   balancing pain control with respiratory status given hypersomnolence
   and hypercapnia yesterday.
 Open CCY:  Balancing pain meds as above.  Do need to try to mobilize
   him to the cardiac chair today given he is at higher risk for
   postoperative pneumonia given underlying COPD, splinting secondary to
   pain, atelectasis.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC:  COPD with exacerbation in
   setting of volume overload postoperatively.  Gentle diuresis today with
   goal of 500 cc negative.  Given tenuous respiraotry status, continue to
   monitor in ICU.
 CHF,  LVEF~30%:  On captoril, lasix 20 mg IV x 1 this morning.
   Follow I/0s and electrolytes.  Replete K and Mg as needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of postoperative respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fatigue, anemia, and pain. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/47 mmHg to 156/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight is currently 146.5 kg, with a fluid balance of -1.5 L since midnight. The patient is receiving various medications including furosemide, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for fatigue and minimal pain. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has been extubated to BiPAP. The patient's extremities show trace edema in both lower extremities. The patient's respiratory status indicates crackles at the bases of the lungs and a prolonged expiratory phase. 

Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 9.6 g/dL, leukocyte count at 266 K/uL, sodium at 107 mg/dL, potassium at 0.7 mg/dL, chloride at 28 mEq/L, bicarbonate at 7 mg/dL, BUN at 104 mEq/L, creatinine at 1.3 mg/dL, glucose at 113 mg/dL, and an HCT of 31.1%. Other labs are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment includes pain control, respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, volume overload, congestive heart failure (CHF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of approximately 30%, and acute kidney injury (AKI). 

The plan includes gentle diuresis to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500 cc, close monitoring of I/Os and electrolytes, repletion of potassium and magnesium as needed, and continued ICU care. The patient is on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Changes to oxycodone.
 OPEN CCY:  Pain adequately controlled. Normal bowel sounds on exam.
   Tolerating clears.  Poor appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: Secondary to volume overlaod
   and underlying COPD.  Improved with diuresis.  Likely some component of
   atelectasis.  Incentive spirometry, out of bed to chair as tolerated.
   Continue bronchodilators.  Lasix this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of underlying COPD. The patient was started on clears per surgery and has shown improvement with diuresis. The patient is tolerating clears and has normal bowel sounds on examination. Pain is adequately controlled with oxycodone. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to volume overload and underlying COPD. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and crackles at the bases of the lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization leading to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and pressure on certain areas.
4. Nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or urinary tract infections (UTIs).
5. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to fluid overload.
6. Increased risk of aspiration pneumonia due to decreased protective airway reflexes.
7. Delirium or cognitive dysfunction due to sepsis, medication effects, or other factors.
8. Worsening respiratory function and further exacerbation of acute on chronic respiratory failure.
9. Poor wound healing or non-healing wounds due to impaired tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
