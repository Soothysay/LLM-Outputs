","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure following an ERCP procedure. The patient sustained an intestinal perforation and underwent surgery. Post-operatively, the patient had episodes of hypotension treated with fluids and sustained on ventilatory support overnight with a respiratory system compliance pressure-volume (RSBI) of 48.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/37 to 132/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 2 mmHg, and fluid balance shows a total input of 3,808 mL and output of 1,200 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 219 mL since midnight.

The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, plateau pressure of 12 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg,"

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/36-70/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 48, indicating the need for continued intubation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. There are also indications of electrolyte imbalances and elevated blood glucose levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, temporal wasting, mildly icteric sclera, dry mucous membranes, and no jugular venous distention. Her lungs are clear anteriorly, and there are no signs of calf pain or swelling.

Assessment and plan include hypotension, acute respiratory failure, and potential complications from bowel perforation, liver biopsy bleed, and ongoing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating a risk for inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female who underwent repair of a duodenal perforation and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient was previously intubated but was successfully extubated and is now doing well with stable hemodynamics. 

The patient's medical history includes a painless jaundice following an ERCP procedure, which was complicated by a duodenal perforation. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, repair of the perforation, and creation of a gastrojejunal and cholecystojejunal anastomosis.

The patient's current vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 143/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is described as attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movements with normal tone.

The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, but overall the results are within normal limits.

The patient's pain is minimal and located in the abdomen. She has an NG tube in place, and her Foley catheter output is adequate. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive fluid intake of 2,319 mL and an output of 2,595 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -276"
