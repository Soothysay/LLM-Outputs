   61yo woman with COPD admitted with respiratory distress in setting of
   suspected pulmonary infection.
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -       azithromycin and ceftriaxone for possible bronchitis or
   pneumonia
   -          solumedrol 125mg IV q8h for one more day, then wean down
   -          levalbuterol nebs (has not tolerated albuterol due to
   tremulousness)
   -          atrovent standing
   -          flonase
   -          f/u sputum culture
   -          wean oxygen as she is [**Age over 90 **]% on 4L this AM
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Baseline Cr 0.6,
   Current Cr 0.8
   -          Cr improving with IV fluids, but still appears dry with
   elevated Cr and poor urine output
   -          Most likely is behind on fluids because of poor po over last
   few days
   -          bolus with 500cc NS over 30 minutes then 1L of NS
   maintenance
   -          follow Cr closely
 .H/O CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   -          denies chest pain despite continued tachycardia
   -          continue ASA, plavix and statin
   -          repeat cardiac enzymes this morning
   -          repeat EKG
   # Tachycardia:  DDx includes albuterol side effect, dehydration, or PE.
   -          trial of more aggressive IV fluids (but careful given report
   of volume overload at prior admission)
   -          continue levalbuterol
   -          defer work-up of PE for the time being as low clinical
   suspicion given that her dyspnea responded so quickly to COPD treatment
   # Leukocytosis:  Noted on admission, resolving.
   -          given that urine appears cloudy, will check UA
   -          covered for possible UTI with ceftriaxone/azithromycin
   # Hyperkalemia:  unclear etiology
   -          repeat EKG
   -          recheck K+ this AM
   -          may require calcium gluconate/kayexalate

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress suspected to be due to a pulmonary infection. The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea. 

During her stay in the ICU, the patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics for possible bronchitis or pneumonia, intravenous steroids, levalbuterol nebs, atrovent, flonase, and oxygen therapy. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, markedly kyphotic, and has normal eye findings. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds and no murmurs. Peripheral vascular examination shows absent pulses in both radial and dorsalis pedis arteries. Respiratory examination shows wheezes and rhonchi, good air movement with a prolonged expiratory phase, and chest wall deformity. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds. Extremities show muscle wasting and no cyanosis. Neurologic examination shows an attentive patient with a resting tremor in both upper extremities. 

Laboratory results indicate the following: white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hem"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. 

The patient is being treated with oxygen therapy, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, solumedrol, levalbuterol nebs, atrovent standing, flonase, and fentanyl patch for pain control. 

She also has a diagnosis of acute renal failure, with an improving creatinine level from 0.6 to 0.8. The cause of renal failure is not specified in the note. 

There is a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), but the patient denies chest pain. She is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and a statin. 

The patient's tachycardia is attributed to albuterol side effects, dehydration, or possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Further work-up for PE is deferred due to low clinical suspicion. 

The patient is also diagnosed with osteoporosis and is being treated with calcium, vitamin D, fentanyl patch, nortryptiline, and percocet for pain control. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular diet and does not require glycemic control. She has an 18-gauge line placed on 04/25/2204 at 06:09 PM. Prophylactic measures include subQ heparin for DVT and PPI for stress ulcer. VAP prevention is not mentioned. 

The patient's code status is full code, and she is being transferred to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, as well as acute renal failure and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 146/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of dyspnea and respiratory symptoms. On physical examination, the patient appears thin and markedly kyphotic, with wheezes and rhonchi on lung auscultation. The patient also has muscle wasting and pinpoint erythematous macules on his left foot. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose level, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels. The patient is currently receiving levalbuterol for respiratory distress and has been weaned off aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and rhonchi suggest ongoing respiratory distress. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient's COPD exacerbation is not adequately managed.
2. Acute Respiratory"

   and watch Cr closely
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   -          has been tachycardic in past during COPD exacerbations; this
   is likely due to sympathetic outflow in setting of acute illness as

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of COPD, bronchitis, and emphysema admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and possible bronchitis. She experienced acute worsening of respiratory status this morning, with desaturation to 89% on 2L, and was started on nebs and O2. The patient has been on various medications including azithromycin, ceftriaxone, solumedrol, albuterol, flonase, atrovent, and singular. She also has positive fluid balance since admission, elevated blood pressure, and an elevated creatinine level indicating possible volume overload. The patient's leukocytosis is most likely secondary to steroids. There are no signs of infection in the urine analysis. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease but her cardiac enzymes are negative. She is on ASA, Plavix, and a statin. The patient also has osteoporosis and is on calcium, vitamin D, and pain management medications. She has an 18-gauge line in place for prophylaxis against DVT and stress ulcers, and if intubated, will receive tube feeds. The patient's code status is full code, but she does not want a tracheostomy. She is currently in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient experienced an episode of increased shortness of breath this morning, which necessitated intubation.

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with the following settings: VT (set) 600 mL, RR (set) 18, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, and SpO2 98%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 69 mmHg, HCO3- 28 mEq/L, and BE 4 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/76 to 180/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (17.6 K/uL) and blood glucose levels (159, 148, 117 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal limits.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is most likely due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/72 mmHg to 180/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's kidney function has shown a slight decline, with a baseline creatinine level of 0.6 and current creatinine level of 0.8. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, but it has been ruled out with negative cardiac enzyme tests on admission. The patient's other medical conditions include osteoporosis, hypertension, and chronic pain management.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up tests for respiratory function should be implemented to prevent this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures like subcut"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchitis/pneumonia. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to worsening respiratory distress. She has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and osteoporosis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 133/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is receiving sedation and analgesia through fentanyl and midazolam infusions. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and a slightly elevated creatinine level. Chest X-ray shows consolidation in the right lower lobe with underlying pleural effusion, which could indicate atelectasis or pneumonia. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been diuresed negative 1L. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the use of central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from restraints can lead to pressure ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently comfortable on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSI) of 40. The plan is to change to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and start tapering ventilator support.

2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Bronchitis, and Emphysema with Acute Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, bronchitis, and emphysema, which has led to an acute exacerbation. The patient remains on antibiotics and will continue to be diuresed as positive pressure is reduced.

3. Bacterial Pneumonia, Community Acquired (CAP): The patient's temperature has decreased, indicating improvement. However, the chest X-ray shows minimal improvement.

4. Hypertension, Benign: The patient has hypertension, but it is described as benign.

5. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to the critical illness.

6. Tachycardia, Other: The patient is experiencing an abnormal heart rate (tachycardia) not related to ventricular tachycardia or sinus tachycardia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a chief complaint of dyspnea. She has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and possible respiratory infection. Her medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and osteoporosis. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but has been extubated successfully. She has shown improvement in her respiratory status and is now on CPAP/PPS with nasal cannula. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 103-181 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows improving aeration in the right lower lobe but no pulmonary edema. The patient is being treated for COPD exacerbation, possible community-acquired pneumonia, hypertension, acute renal failure, and other cardiac conditions. She is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's current plan is to stay in the ICU overnight for monitoring of respiratory status and improved blood pressure control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure indicates a critical condition that requires close monitoring and appropriate interventions.

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and possible respiratory infection. She was admitted with dyspnea and respiratory failure, and subsequently intubated. The patient had a medication error in the morning, leading to oversedation and poor performance on a trial of pressure support (PS) ventilation. However, she did well on a subsequent trial of PS when awake and was successfully extubated at around 4 pm.

Since then, the patient has had an increased secretions volume (SSI), received more than 500 cc of diuresis with one-time lasix dose, and started on metoprolol for persistent tachycardia with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She also received a 250 cc normal saline bolus at 5 am for low urine output.

The patient's allergies include a last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone, given at 12:30 pm on [date]. She is currently on various infusions and other ICU medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started at 6:13 am on [date].

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has shown improvement but is still not at baseline. There is a risk of respiratory failure recurring due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may be compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. This could lead to further kidney damage or the need for renal replacement therapy.

3. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure readings, indicating unstable hypertension. If left untreated, it could result in complications such as stroke or heart attack.

4. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. If not properly treated, there is a risk of the infection spreading or developing into sepsis.

5. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures, particularly with limited mobility in the ICU setting.

6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which puts them at risk for cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

7. Nutritional Deficiency: Due to the patient's inability to eat normally, there is a risk of malnutrition and glycemic control issues due to the use of regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures are in place, but vigilance is necessary to prevent this complication.

9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper care and hygiene practices should be maintained to minimize this risk.

10. Delirium: Critically ill patients often experience delirium. Close monitoring and management of the patient's mental status is essential to prevent further cognitive decline.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a chief complaint of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been experiencing confusion, possibly due to steroids. Her breathing has improved but is still not at baseline. The patient has a history of allergies and coronary artery disease (CAD). She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and is currently on antibiotics. She also has hypertension and osteoporosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 151/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 2L through a nasal cannula. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her creatinine and potassium levels are within normal range. Imaging and microbiology reports are negative. The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, acute on chronic COPD exacerbation, hypertension, benign; pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP); coronary artery disease (CAD); and worsening metabolic alkalosis. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU. Her disposition is planned for the floor if she remains at baseline today.

","Summary:
The patient is a frail, elderly individual with a chief complaint of COPD. The patient has been experiencing confusion, which they attribute to steroids. They have been switched from IV to PO steroids. Nutrition recommendations have been provided, suggesting the patient may have a nutritional deficiency. The patient's breathing has improved but is still not at baseline. The patient has a history of allergies to antibiotics, specifically Ceftriaxone. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. They are also on various other medications. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission, except for the addition of osteoporosis. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

24-hour events include changes in the patient's condition, such as confusion, being attributed to steroids, and a change from IV to PO steroids. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/81 to 202/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 2L via nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 50.9 kg, with a height of 63 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,622 mL, output of 2,372 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 750 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman admitted with dyspnea in the setting of COPD and possible respiratory infection. She has been experiencing confusion, which she attributes to steroids. Her breathing has improved but is still not at baseline. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, osteoporosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently receiving various medications including prednisone, atrovent, levalbuterol, montelukast, flonase, and supplemental O2 per home regimen.

24-hour events include a change from IV to PO steroids, nutrition recommendations, and the initiation of heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 151/81 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 bpm. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, but her SpO2 is 89%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery and ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 69 mmHg, and PaO2 of 68 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals plethoric head, ears, nose, and throat, normal cardiovascular examination, crackles and wheezes in the respiratory/chest examination, soft non-tender abdomen, muscle wasting in the extremities, and attentive neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 8.2 K/u"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman admitted with dyspnea in the setting of worsening COPD and possible pulmonary infection. She was initially intubated but extubated on 12/27. She continues to be on supplemental oxygen due to dyspnea with activity. Her mental status has improved, and she is less confused. She experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/82 to 182/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is still somewhat tight and dyspneic with talking or moving in bed. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for back pain. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal creatinine, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, pneumonia, hypertension, acute renal failure (resolved), tachycardia (resolved), coronary artery disease, and osteoporosis. She is receiving treatment for these conditions and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a chief complaint of dyspnea. She has been admitted with worsening chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a possible pulmonary infection. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving treatment for her conditions. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 64-89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102-182 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. Her temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, indicating an inflammatory response or infection. Her hemoglobin level is 43.7%, which is slightly elevated. The platelet count is within normal range. Kidney function is normal, as indicated by the creatinine level. Blood glucose levels are controlled with regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. She is currently receiving medications for both conditions, including statins, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes on respiratory auscultation, suggesting ongoing respiratory distress. There is no evidence of heart murmur or peripheral edema. Musculoskeletal examination shows muscle wasting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of COPD exacerbation. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments for her condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 62-95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87-132 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 17-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on 2L NC. The patient's recent events include starting Zyprexa for agitation and anxiety, increasing the dose of metoprolol, and increasing the rate of prednisone taper. The patient's allergies are not mentioned in the note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. There is a potential risk of respiratory failure due to the underlying lung conditions.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments, indicating a potential risk for uncontrolled hypertension.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels were initially elevated, suggesting possible acute renal failure. However, it resolved with improved urine output.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently above the normal range, indicating potential tachycardia.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, and there is a risk of ischemic heart disease exacerbation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of COPD exacerbation. She was started on Zyprexa to manage agitation and anxiety, which seemed to help somewhat. The patient's blood pressure required a one-time dose of hydralazine after increasing the dose of metoprolol. The prednisone taper was also increased to achieve a dose of 40mg tomorrow. The patient is experiencing thick yellow secretions, indicating a potential infection. The patient's allergies include a last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone, on 04/30/2204 at 02:00 PM. She is currently receiving various infusions and other ICU medications.

Review of Systems:
- Respiratory: Cough, Dyspnea, Wheeze, improved
- Neurologic: anxious

Flowsheet Data:
- Vital signs: Temperature within normal range, heart rate stable, blood pressure fluctuating, respiratory rate slightly elevated, oxygen saturation at 94%
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus rhythm, blood pressure fluctuations
- Fluid balance: Total In 652 mL, Total Out 1115 mL, Balance -463 mL
- Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery through nasal cannula, SpO2 at 94%
- Physical examination: Anxious, crackles and wheezes in bilateral chest, warm skin, attentive and oriented neurologically

Lab Results:

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of COPD exacerbation. She is currently in the ICU. The patient's 24-hour events include starting Zyprexa for continued agitation and anxiety, which helped somewhat. She also met with the patient and her daughters to explain why she is still in the ICU. The dose of metoprolol was increased, and the patient required a one-time dose of hydralazine with good BP response. The rate of prednisone taper was increased (to get 40mg tomorrow). There was an increase in suctioning with lots of thick yellow secretions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of COPD exacerbation. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

During the 24-hour period, several events occurred. The patient was started on Zyprexa to address continued agitation and anxiety, which helped somewhat. A meeting was held with the patient and her daughters to explain the reason for her continued stay in the ICU. The dose of metoprolol was increased, and the patient required a one-time dose of hydralazine with good blood pressure response. The rate of prednisone taper was increased to bring it down to 40mg tomorrow. There has also been an increase in suctioning with lots of thick yellow secretions.

The patient is currently taking various medications including antibiotics (Ceftriaxone), hydralazine, metoprolol, prednisone, captopril, diltiazem, protonix, fluticasone, montelukast, nortriptyline, fentanyl patch, Plavix, simvastatin, and SQ heparin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and wheeze, which have improved. The patient is anxious.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal limits, with the exception of blood pressure being on the higher end. The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema with an acute exacerbation.
- The patient also has pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), for which they are being treated with antibiotics.
- The patient has hypertension and acute renal failure, which has since resolved.
- The patient has tachycardia and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).
- Other issues include osteoporosis, ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and lines inserted for medical purposes.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure puts them at risk for further respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxia, respiratory acidosis, or even respiratory arrest if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia, if left untreated or inadequately treated, can lead to a worsening infection, sepsis, or other complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions.
3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD can worsen during the acute exacerbation, leading to increased shortness of breath, frequent infections, and potentially respiratory failure.
4. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart attack.
5. Renal failure: Although the patient's acute renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female admitted to the ICU with dyspnea. She has been experiencing confusion and visual hallucinations. Her chest X-ray shows atelectasis and old rib fractures. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation, pneumonia, hypertension, renal failure, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She is currently receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and being treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 173/65 to 177/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood glucose levels are well-controlled with regular insulin. She has been started on captopril and nitro paste for hypertension and increased doses of lopressor and diltiazem. Her kidney function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress, tachypnea, and use of accessory muscles indicate ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support may be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient's WBC count is trending upward, suggesting a possible ongoing infection. Cultures from blood, urine, and sputum are negative, but it is still important to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing confusion, requiring restraints overnight. The patient has a history of encephalopathy and allergies to tetracyclines. He is receiving various medications including haloperidol, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, dyspnea, wheezing, agitation, and delirium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/82 to 102/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is receiving supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the chest, warm and ecchymotic skin, and muscle wasting. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's assessment includes delirium likely caused by steroid use, acute respiratory failure now improved, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, and other medical conditions. The plan includes tapering steroids, reorienting and managing confusion with antipsychotic medication, and providing respiratory support.

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   -          improving with tapering steroid dose;  continue to taper
   steroids to 10mg daily (which is her baseline dose) tomorrow so long as
   it is tolerated by her respiratory status
   -          hold nortriptyline while confused
   -          currently not requiring restraints
   -          redirect as needed, monitor closely
   -          continue zyprexa [**Hospital1 **] and give haldol only if needed
   -          monitor QTc closely while on QT prolonging agents
   # Hematuria and Hct drop:
   - repeat Hct and send T+S
   - send UA, though of note, UA on admission showed large blood
   - do not suspect other source of bleeding as coags normal, no risk
   factors for retroperitoneal bleed, but monitor exam and Hct closely
   - stool OB negative
   # Hypoglycemia:
   -          most likely from decreasing insulin requirement as steroids
   tapered

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who was admitted for respiratory distress. She developed delirium while on steroids and is now showing signs of improvement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58 bpm and blood pressure of 121/56 mmHg. She is still requiring supplemental oxygen but at a lower flow rate. Her lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. The chest X-ray reveals new right perihilar consolidation, indicating a possible pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has been experiencing delirium, which is improving with the tapering of the steroid dose. It is important to continue monitoring her closely and redirecting as needed.
2. Hematuria and Hct drop: The patient has hematuria and a dropping hemoglobin level. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, with repeat Hct, T+S, and UA being ordered. Close monitoring of the patient's exam and Hct levels will be necessary.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are low, likely due to the decreasing insulin requirement as steroids are tapered. Adjustments to the insulin sliding scale should be made to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, but it has now improved. Continued management of"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted due to an increased COPD exacerbation. The patient has shown improvement in terms of orientation and hematuria. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and she is experiencing delirium or confusion. This may be due to steroid tapering, and it is important to monitor the QTc interval as the patient is on medications that can prolong it. Providing frequent reorientation is recommended.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had low blood sugar levels, which may be related to insulin resistance decreased in the setting of decreased steroids. It is advised to follow fingerstick glucose levels.

3. Anemia, Acute: The patient has developed acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This could be due to hematuria, and her hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. Transfusion of packed red blood cells is recommended when hemoglobin (Hb) drops below 7.

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient initially experienced acute respiratory failure but has now improved. Continued bronchodilators, Singulair, Flonase, and suctioning at baseline O2 requirement are recommended.

5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with Acute Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, has been admitted to the ICU with increased COPD symptoms. She is currently improving and becoming more oriented. Hematuria is improving despite having a Foley catheter in place. The patient's EKG showed a QTc of 480, so zyprexa with haldol prn will be continued while monitoring the QTc. Sliding scale insulin and BP med doses have been decreased.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's sugars have improved since yesterday AM, likely due to decreased insulin resistance in the setting of decreased steroids. It is important to follow fingersticks to monitor blood sugar levels.
2. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient likely has acute anemia due to blood loss, possibly from hematuria. Her Hct is stable from yesterday. A stool guiac test was negative, indicating no gastrointestinal bleeding. She should be considered for a transfusion when her hemoglobin level falls below 7.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient is less confused as steroids are being tapered. Measures should be taken to provide frequent reorientation. Foley catheter should be discontinued.
4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure has now improved.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and osteoporosis. The patient presented to the hospital with hypoxia and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/47 mmHg to 142/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. However, the patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 72 mg/dL and 127 mg/dL. The patient has been diagnosed with delirium likely due to steroids, acute respiratory failure not associated with ARDS, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: Delirium is a potential complication in elderly patients, especially those receiving high doses of corticosteroids. It is characterized by confusion, disorientation, and changes in mental status. Monitoring the patient's mental status and providing a supportive environment can help"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxia. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and osteoporosis.

From the review of systems, the patient does not have any cough or fevers. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/47 to 142/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination findings include sinus rhythm, normal peripheral vascular pulses, and unassessed skin and neurologic examination due to the patient's delirium. 

Laboratory results show normal hemoglobin levels, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.4 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values such as glucose, CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, PT/PTT/INR, and differential white blood cell count are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include resolution of hypoglycemia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, delirium likely due to steroids, and acute respiratory failure now improved. The patient will be placed back on their home COPD"
