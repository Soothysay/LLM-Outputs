   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with multiple medical problems,
   including prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia,
   presenting with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding, in critical
   condition.
   .
   #  GI BLEED: Patient with prior episodes of erosive gastritis and GI
   Bleed, also with known diverticulosis, AAA and history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation. DDx would therefore also include aorto-enteric
   fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, etc. Given degree of
   bleeding however and excessive anticoagulation for  prosthetic valve
   makes most likely diagnosis mucosal bleed vs diverticular bleed,
   especially in light of unrevealing diagnosis in the past. Highly
   unlikely for such slow bleed to represent aortoenteric fistula.
   No response to 2 units of PRBC and still with melena
   -- Maintain active type and screen, large bore PIV's
   -- Transfuse 3 U PRBC / 2 units FFP
   -- Goal Hct > 25 given severity of CAD
   -- Appreciate GI consult team following
   .
   #  VALVULAR HEART DISEASE / PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]
   mechanical valve in aortic position, also with Moderate MR / TR.
   -- If actively bleeding, will need FFP
   -- Avoid Vitamin K to minimize risk of valve thrombosis
   -- Will likely need furosemide with transfusions to avoid pulmonary
   edema in setting of known diastolic heart disease and mitral valve
   regurgitation.
   -- Avoid tachycardia as this will predispose to pulmonary edema.
   .
   #  ENDOCARDITIS, PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient will require ongoing
   treatment with IV Cefazolin.
   -- Continue cefazolin q8H
   -- Per last ID note, last day [**3-12**]
   .
   #  SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Unclear etiology of significantly elevated
   INR, although patient has been on IV antibiotics for a prolonged course
   and has likely erradicated intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers. No other
   clear drug interactions noted.
   -- Hold warfarin
   -- Goal INR 2.5 to 3.5 given mechanical valve at aortic position with
   atrial fibrillation, however given propensity to bleed may require
   tighter goal of near 3.0
   -- FFP PRN for bleeding
   .
   #  DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Appears only mildly volume up, however with
   significant blood loss will hold off on diuresis
   -- As above, avoid tachycardia
   -- Hold diuretics, antihypertensives during acute bleeding.
   .
   #  NECK PAIN: Chronic pain secondary to shingles. patient takes
   oxycodone at home however for now would favor using IV morphine as
   needed for breakthrough pain.
   .
   #. ECG CHANGES: In setting of profound anemia most likely due to demand
   ischemia. Negative troponins on admission, would not continue to trend
   -- ECG in AM.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia. He is currently in critical condition and has been experiencing supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding. 

The patient has a history of prosthetic valve, recent MSSA bacteremia, prior episodes of erosive gastritis and GI bleeding, known diverticulosis, AAA, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The differential diagnosis for the GI bleed includes mucosal bleed, diverticular bleed, aorto-enteric fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, among others. 

The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) but still presents with melena. He is maintained on active type and screen, large bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, and is being transfused with 3 units of PRBC and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The goal hematocrit (Hct) is >25 due to the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Regarding the valvular heart disease/prosthetic valve, the patient has a mechanical valve in the aortic position, moderate mitral regurgitation/tricuspid regurgitation, and requires FFP if actively bleeding. Vitamin K is avoided to minimize the risk of valve thrombosis. Furosemide may be needed during transfusions to avoid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including a prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia. He presented with supratherapeutic INR and gastrointestinal bleeding, in critical condition. The patient has a history of erosive gastritis and GI bleed, known diverticulosis, AAA, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He is also on warfarin due to his mechanical valve in the aortic position.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced GI bleeding, which could be due to mucosal erosion, diverticular bleeding, or an aorto-enteric fistula. The excessive anticoagulation from warfarin increases the risk of bleeding.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR levels are elevated, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. This may be due to the use of warfarin, prolonged IV antibiotics, or eradication of intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient appears to have diastolic heart failure, as indicated by mild volume overload and significant blood loss. However, diuretics are being withheld during acute bleeding.
4. Prosthetic Valve Dysfunction: The patient has a mechanical valve in the aortic position, requiring ongoing treatment with IV cefazolin. There is a risk of valve thrombosis and potential complications associated with anticoagulation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with multiple medical problems,
   including prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia,
   presenting with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding, in critical
   condition.
   .
   #  GI BLEED: Patient with prior episodes of erosive gastritis and GI
   Bleed, also with known diverticulosis, AAA and history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation. DDx would therefore also include aorto-enteric
   fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, etc. Given degree of
   bleeding however and excessive anticoagulation for  prosthetic valve
   makes most likely diagnosis mucosal bleed vs diverticular bleed,
   especially in light of unrevealing diagnosis in the past. Highly
   unlikely for such slow bleed to represent aortoenteric fistula.
   No response to 2 units of PRBC and still with melena
   -- Maintain active type and screen, large bore PIV's
   -- Transfuse PRN
   -- Goal Hct > 25 given severity of CAD
   -- Appreciate GI consult team following
   - -will likely need endoscopic management eventually
   -- lasix 40 IV now to avoid volume overload
   -- q6h Hct today
   .
   #  VALVULAR HEART DISEASE / PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]
   mechanical valve in aortic position, also with Moderate MR / TR.
   -- If actively bleeding, will need FFP
   -- Avoid Vitamin K to minimize risk of valve thrombosis
   -- Will likely need furosemide with transfusions to avoid pulmonary
   edema in setting of known diastolic heart disease and mitral valve
   regurgitation.
   -- Avoid tachycardia as this will predispose to pulmonary edema.
   .
   #  ENDOCARDITIS, PROSTHETIC VALVE:  Patient will require ongoing
   treatment with IV Cefazolin.
   -- Continue cefazolin q8H
   -- Per last ID note, last day [**3-12**]
   -- Touch base with ID to see if they want to see him in house
   -- Touch base with EP regarding his external pacer
   .
   #  SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Unclear etiology of significantly elevated
   INR, although patient has been on IV antibiotics for a prolonged course
   and has likely erradicated intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers. No other
   clear drug interactions noted.  INR still 6.1.  Just finished 4 units
   FFP.
   -- Hold warfarin
   -- Goal INR 2.5 to 3.5 given mechanical valve at aortic position with
   atrial fibrillation, however given propensity to bleed may require
   tighter goal of near 3.0
   -- one unit FFP now
   -- check coags again with next Hct
   .
   #  DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Appears only mildly volume up, however with
   significant blood loss will hold off on diuresis
   -- As above, avoid tachycardia
   -- Hold diuretics, antihypertensives during acute bleeding.
   -- 40 of lasix IV now with blood, as above
   -- I/O, goal even to negative 500 cc
   .
   #  NECK PAIN: Chronic pain secondary to shingles. patient takes
   oxycodone at home however for now would favor using IV morphine as
   needed for breakthrough pain.
   .
   #. ECG CHANGES: In setting of profound anemia most likely due to demand
   ischemia. Negative troponins on admission, would not continue to trend
   -- ECG in AM.

","Summary:
The patient presented with melena at the rehabilitation facility and was subsequently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been receiving multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to ongoing bleeding. The etiology of the gastrointestinal bleed remains unclear. The patient also has bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), for which they are tolerating cefazolin. Splinter hemorrhages were observed on examination, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered. The patient's condition is critical, and they have a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and they have been receiving vasopressors. Fluid balance has been monitored closely, and the patient has received both crystalloids and blood products. The patient's laboratory values indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels. The patient's glucose level is within normal range, and cardiac enzymes are negative. An initial chest X-ray showed a pacemaker in place. The patient is currently receiving nutrition support and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient presented with melena at a rehabilitation center. They were admitted to the ICU and received a PICC line insertion, nuclear medicine procedure, and transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), with an ongoing fifth unit. The patient has allergies to nafcillin, renal toxicity, and last received antibiotics. They are currently receiving infusions of morphine sulfate, furosemide (Lasix), and other medications including cefazolin and famotidine.

The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except where noted above and below. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), current temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 79 bpm with a range of 76-87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/44 mmHg to 141/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 12-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm with no acute distress.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds with faint crackles at the bases, soft non-tender abdomen, trace right lower extremity edema, varicosity of the right leg, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   ICU Care
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with multiple medical problems,
   including prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia,
   presenting with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding, in critical
   condition.
   .
   #  GI BLEED: Patient with prior episodes of erosive gastritis and GI
   Bleed, also with known diverticulosis, AAA and history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation. DDx would therefore also include aorto-enteric
   fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, etc. Given degree of
   bleeding however and excessive anticoagulation for  prosthetic valve
   makes most likely diagnosis mucosal bleed vs diverticular bleed,
   especially in light of unrevealing diagnosis in the past. Highly
   unlikely for such slow bleed to represent aortoenteric fistula. Hct now
   stable after total of 6 units of pRBCs.
   - ?endoscopy by GI today; reverse INR with FFP
   -- Maintain active type and screen, large bore PIV's
   -- Transfuse PRN to keep Hct > 25 given severity of CAD
   -- Appreciate GI consult team following
   -- q8h Hct
   .
   #  VALVULAR HEART DISEASE / PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]
   mechanical valve in aortic position, also with Moderate MR / TR. INR
   4.1 today; goal 2.5 to 3.5
   -- monitor INR closely
   -- Avoid Vitamin K to minimize risk of valve thrombosis
   .
   #  ENDOCARDITIS, PROSTHETIC VALVE:  Patient will require ongoing
   treatment with IV Cefazolin.
   -- Continue cefazolin q8H; per last ID note, last day [**3-12**]
   -- Touch base with EP regarding his external pacer
   .
   #  SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Unclear etiology of significantly elevated
   INR, although patient has been on IV antibiotics for a prolonged course
   and has likely erradicated intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers. No other
   clear drug interactions noted.  INR improving to 4.1 today after
   multiple units of FFP.
   -- continue to hold warfarin
   -- trend INR
   .
   #  DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Received some furosemide boluses with blood
   transfusion. Currently appears euvolemic.
   -- Hold diuretics, antihypertensives during acute bleeding.
   -- I/O, goal even to negative 500 cc
   .
   #  NECK PAIN: Chronic pain secondary to shingles. patient takes
   oxycodone at home however for now would favor using IV morphine as
   needed for breakthrough pain.
   .
   #. ECG CHANGES: In setting of profound anemia most likely due to demand
   ischemia. Negative troponins on admission, would not continue to trend
   -- ECG in AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including a prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia. He presented with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding in critical condition. The patient has a history of erosive gastritis, GI bleed, diverticulosis, AAA, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The differential diagnosis for the GI bleed includes mucosal bleed, diverticular bleed, aorto-enteric fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, etc. Given the degree of bleeding and excessive anticoagulation for the prosthetic valve, the most likely diagnosis is a mucosal bleed.

The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and his hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is now stable. An endoscopy has been ordered by the GI team to further evaluate and manage the GI bleed. The INR needs to be reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and active typing and crossmatching (type and screen) should be maintained. Large bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines are also recommended.

The patient has a mechanical valve in the aortic position and moderate mitral regurgitation/tricuspid regurgitation. The target INR range for the patient is 2.5 to 3.5"

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   ICU Care
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with multiple medical problems,
   including prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia,
   presenting with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding, in critical
   condition.
   .
   #  GI BLEED: Patient with prior episodes of erosive gastritis and GI
   Bleed, also with known diverticulosis, AAA and history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation. DDx would therefore also include aorto-enteric
   fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, etc. Given degree of
   bleeding however and excessive anticoagulation for  prosthetic valve
   makes most likely diagnosis mucosal bleed vs diverticular bleed,
   especially in light of unrevealing diagnosis in the past. Highly
   unlikely for such slow bleed to represent aortoenteric fistula.
   No response to 2 units of PRBC and still with melena
   -- Maintain active type and screen, large bore PIV's
   -- Transfuse PRN
   -- Goal Hct > 25 given severity of CAD
   -- Appreciate GI consult team following
   - -will likely need endoscopic management eventually
   -- lasix 40 IV now to avoid volume overload
   -- q6h Hct today
   .
   #  VALVULAR HEART DISEASE / PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]
   mechanical valve in aortic position, also with Moderate MR / TR.
   -- If actively bleeding, will need [**Male First Name (un) **]
   -- Avoid Vitamin K to minimize risk of valve thrombosis
   -- Will likely need furosemide with transfusions to avoid pulmonary
   edema in setting of known diastolic heart disease and mitral valve
   regurgitation.
   -- Avoid tachycardia as this will predispose to pulmonary edema.
   .
   #  ENDOCARDITIS, PROSTHETIC VALVE:  Patient will require ongoing
   treatment with IV Cefazolin.
   -- Continue cefazolin q8H
   -- Per last ID note, last day [**3-12**]
   -- Touch base with ID to see if they want to see him in house
   -- Touch base with EP regarding his external pacer
   .
   #  SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Unclear etiology of significantly elevated
   INR, although patient has been on IV antibiotics for a prolonged course
   and has likely erradicated intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers. No other
   clear drug interactions noted.  INR still 6.1.  Just finished 4 units
   [**Month/Year (2) **].
   -- Hold warfarin
   -- Goal INR 2.5 to 3.5 given mechanical valve at aortic position with
   atrial fibrillation, however given propensity to bleed may require
   tighter goal of near 3.0
   -- one unit [**Month/Year (2) **] now
   -- check coags again with next Hct
   .
   #  DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Appears only mildly volume up, however with
   significant blood loss will hold off on diuresis
   -- As above, avoid tachycardia
   -- Hold diuretics, antihypertensives during acute bleeding.
   -- 40 of lasix IV now with blood, as above
   -- I/O, goal even to negative 500 cc
   .
   #  NECK PAIN: Chronic pain secondary to shingles. patient takes
   oxycodone at home however for now would favor using IV morphine as
   needed for breakthrough pain.
   .
   #. ECG CHANGES: In setting of profound anemia most likely due to demand
   ischemia. Negative troponins on admission, would not continue to trend
   -- ECG in AM.

","The patient is a 76-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including a prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia. He is currently in the ICU for supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding. The patient has a history of erosive gastritis and GI bleeding, as well as known diverticulosis, AAA, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued bleeding from the GI tract due to erosive gastritis or diverticulosis.
2. Development of acute kidney injury or worsening of renal function due to hypovolemia and use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the presence of a mechanical heart valve and elevated INR.
4. Infection due to prolonged antibiotic use and indwelling lines.
5. Cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias due to underlying heart disease and fluid shifts.
6. Pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
7. Malnutrition or poor glycemic control due to reduced oral intake and stress response to illness.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

These are potential complications that may arise, and the patient's progress should be closely monitored to prevent or manage these complications effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   ICU Care
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with multiple medical problems,
   including prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia,
   presenting with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding, in critical
   condition.
   .
   #  GI BLEED: Patient with prior episodes of erosive gastritis and GI
   Bleed, also with known diverticulosis, AAA and history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation. DDx would therefore also include aorto-enteric
   fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, etc. Given degree of
   bleeding however and excessive anticoagulation for  prosthetic valve
   makes most likely diagnosis mucosal bleed vs diverticular bleed,
   especially in light of unrevealing diagnosis in the past. Highly
   unlikely for such slow bleed to represent aortoenteric fistula.
   No response to 2 units of PRBC and still with melena
   -- Maintain active type and screen, large bore PIV's
   -- Transfuse PRN
   -- Goal Hct > 25 given severity of CAD
   -- Appreciate GI consult team following
   - -will likely need endoscopic management eventually
   -- lasix 40 IV now to avoid volume overload
   -- q6h Hct today
   .
   #  VALVULAR HEART DISEASE / PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]
   mechanical valve in aortic position, also with Moderate MR / TR.
   -- If actively bleeding, will need FFP
   -- Avoid Vitamin K to minimize risk of valve thrombosis
   -- Will likely need furosemide with transfusions to avoid pulmonary
   edema in setting of known diastolic heart disease and mitral valve
   regurgitation.
   -- Avoid tachycardia as this will predispose to pulmonary edema.
   .
   #  ENDOCARDITIS, PROSTHETIC VALVE:  Patient will require ongoing
   treatment with IV Cefazolin.
   -- Continue cefazolin q8H
   -- Per last ID note, last day [**3-12**]
   -- Touch base with ID to see if they want to see him in house
   -- Touch base with EP regarding his external pacer
   .
   #  SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Unclear etiology of significantly elevated
   INR, although patient has been on IV antibiotics for a prolonged course
   and has likely erradicated intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers. No other
   clear drug interactions noted.  INR still 6.1.  Just finished 4 units
   FFP.
   -- Hold warfarin
   -- Goal INR 2.5 to 3.5 given mechanical valve at aortic position with
   atrial fibrillation, however given propensity to bleed may require
   tighter goal of near 3.0
   -- one unit FFP now
   -- check coags again with next Hct
   .
   #  DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Appears only mildly volume up, however with
   significant blood loss will hold off on diuresis
   -- As above, avoid tachycardia
   -- Hold diuretics, antihypertensives during acute bleeding.
   -- 40 of lasix IV now with blood, as above
   -- I/O, goal even to negative 500 cc
   .
   #  NECK PAIN: Chronic pain secondary to shingles. patient takes
   oxycodone at home however for now would favor using IV morphine as
   needed for breakthrough pain.
   .
   #. ECG CHANGES: In setting of profound anemia most likely due to demand
   ischemia. Negative troponins on admission, would not continue to trend
   -- ECG in AM.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including a prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia. The patient presents with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding in critical condition.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of erosive gastritis and GI bleed, known diverticulosis, AAA, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The bleeding may be due to mucosal erosion or diverticular bleeding. 

2. Valvular heart disease/prosthetic valve: The patient has a mechanical valve in the aortic position. There is a risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and potential valve thrombosis if Vitamin K is administered.

3. Endocarditis, prosthetic valve: The patient requires ongoing treatment with IV Cefazolin due to prosthetic valve endocarditis. 

4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is significantly elevated, which could be caused by prolonged IV antibiotics leading to eradication of intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers. This increases the risk of bleeding.

5. Diastolic heart failure: The patient may have diastolic heart failure with known diastolic heart disease and mitral valve regurgitation. There is a risk of volume overload and pulmonary edema.

6. Neck pain: The patient has chronic neck pain secondary to shingles.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic anticoagulation, recent MSSA bacteremia, heart block following pacemaker placement, admitted with melena/GI bleed and acute blood loss anemia in the setting of supratherapeutic INR. He has had extensive GI workup in the past including endoscopies. A tagged RBC scan did not show the source of the bleed. The patient received a blood transfusion yesterday afternoon, and there has been no obvious melena since then. His hematocrit (hct) levels remain unchanged over the past 12 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: The source of the GI bleed remains unclear, though the unchanged hct levels and absence of further melena suggest that it may have ceased. However, the patient's critically ill condition and critically elevated INR pose a risk for recurrent bleeding.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated with cefazolin for MSSA bacteremia. If the infection is not effectively managed, there is a risk of complications such as sepsis or endocarditis.
3. s/p AVR (Aortic Valve Replacement): The patient's INR needs to be maintained within the target range of 2.5-3.5 post AVR. If the INR is not properly managed, it can lead to bleeding complications or thromboembolic events.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been in the ICU and has received multiple interventions, including antibiotics, diuretics, and blood products. Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 132/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Physical examination reveals crackles at bilateral lung bases and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient is attentive and follows simple commands. Lab results show elevated levels of creatinine and lactate, as well as low potassium and hemoglobin. The patient's INR is still elevated at 4.6.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can continue to be a concern, especially considering the elevated INR and the use of anticoagulant therapy.
2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is important.
3. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has low potassium levels, which should be monitored and potentially corrected.
5. Thromboembolic events"

INR elevated: likley still elevated from malnutrition.. will alow him
   to eat to day.
diastolic heart failure: stable respiratory status, has not needed any
   extra diuresis. Once eating he will likely need some diuresis.

   He did receive a unit of blood for gradual downward drift in Hct- INR
   rose to 5.9, so EGD cancelled
   Recent INR's have remained elevated despite being off coumadin- suspect
   malnutrition contributing as pt has largely been NPO. Will liberate
   diet for today, plans for EGD once INR appropriately down.
   Continue Cefazolin for MSSA bacteremia.

   on:[**2128-3-4**] 13:03 ------
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with MSSA bacteremia admitted for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and acute blood loss anemia. He received a unit of blood due to a gradual downward drift in hematocrit (Hct) levels, but the endoscopy was canceled because his INR rose to 5.9. The patient has been largely NPO (nothing by mouth), leading to an elevated INR. The diet will be liberalized today, and plans for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be made once the INR is appropriately down. He is currently on cefazolin for MSSA bacteremia and appears appropriate for floor transfer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed needs to be closely monitored, as there is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current condition.
2. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition status may contribute to his elevated INR levels. It is essential to address this issue to prevent further complications.
3. Blood product transfusion reactions: The patient has received blood products, which carry the risk of transfusion reactions. Monitoring for any signs of allergic reactions or hemolytic transfusion reactions is necessary.
4. Infection: MSSA bacteremia indicates a potential infection. Continuing appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitoring for signs of infection are important.
5. Diuretic use: The patient may require diuretics"

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB):
   hct continues to trend down will continue to monitor and transfuse to
   keep hct >24. follow up with GI for endoscpy in next 48hours.
INR elevated: likley still elevated from malnutrition.. will alow him
   to eat to day.
diastolic heart failure: stable respiratory status, has not needed any
   extra diuresis. Once eating he will likely need some diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with multiple medical problems,
   including prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia,
   presenting with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding.
   .
   #  GI BLEED: Patient with prior episodes of erosive gastritis and GI
   Bleed, also with known diverticulosis, AAA and history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation. Hct now stable after total of 7 units of pRBCs.
   - hold off on endoscopy by GI today because of high INR and clinical
   stability
   - Maintain active type and screen, large bore PIV's
   -- Transfuse PRN to keep Hct > 25 given severity of CAD
   -- Appreciate GI consult team following
   -- q8h Hct
   .
   #  VALVULAR HEART DISEASE / PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]
   mechanical valve in aortic position, also with Moderate MR / TR. INR
   4.1 today; goal 2.5 to 3.5
   -- monitor INR closely
   -- Avoid Vitamin K to minimize risk of valve thrombosis
   .
   #  ENDOCARDITIS, PROSTHETIC VALVE:  Patient will require ongoing
   treatment with IV Cefazolin.
   -- Continue cefazolin q8H; per last ID note, last day [**3-12**]
   -- Touch base with EP regarding his external pacer
   .
   #  SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Unclear etiology of significantly elevated
   INR, although patient has been on IV antibiotics for a prolonged course
   and has likely erradicated intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers. No other
   clear drug interactions noted.  INR still elevated at 5.9.
   -- continue to hold warfarin
   -- trend INR
   .
   #  DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Received some furosemide boluses with blood
   transfusion. Currently appears euvolemic. Has been autodiuresing well.
   -- Hold diuretics, antihypertensives during acute bleeding.
   -- I/O, goal even to negative 500 cc
   .
   #  NECK PAIN: Chronic pain secondary to shingles. patient takes
   oxycodone at home however for now would favor using IV morphine as
   needed for breakthrough pain.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including a prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia, presenting with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding. He has received a total of 7 units of pRBCs and his Hct is now stable. The plan is to hold off on endoscopy due to high INR and maintain active type and screen, large bore PIV's. The patient has a mechanical valve in the aortic position with moderate MR/TR, and his INR is currently 4.1 with a goal of 2.5-3.5. He will require ongoing treatment with IV Cefazolin. His INR is still elevated at 5.9, and he will continue to hold warfarin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of erosive gastritis, GI bleed, diverticulosis, AAA, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His current Hct is stable after receiving 7 units of pRBCs. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and ongoing assessment of bleeding risk are essential.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering his mechanical valve in the aortic position. Monitoring INR closely and adjusting anticoagulation therapy accordingly is crucial.
3. Prosthetic valve endocarditis"
