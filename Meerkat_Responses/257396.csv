   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63 yo female with a past medical history sig for DM II, HTN, OSA, and
   multiple allergies transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for respiratory failure,
   presumed aspiration, and a likely pneumonia.
   #.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure - ABG showed 7.25/63/221 with a
   bicarb of 29.  Based on these values she has a Mixed acid base primary
   respiratory acidosis with a metabolic alkalosis. She is treated with
   furosemide, and likely has a chronic metabolic alkalosis because of
   it.  The patient presented to clinic with hypoglycemia and shortness of
   breath.  Underlying etilogies include infectious processes such as
   bacterial and viral pneumonia.
   - On AC 500/20/5/50%
   - Follow oxygenation with serial ABGs
   - Continue to wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - Consider ARDSnet ventilation protocol at 6cc/kg ideal body weight due
   to Pao2/Fio2 of 200 and new bilateral infiltrates
   .
   #.  Pneumonia - likely etiologies include aspiration, CAP, flu, and
   other viral etiologies.  Aspiration is possible due to the patient's
   severe gastroparesis with achlasia.  Due to the density of the
   consolidation on imaging, CAP cannot be ruled out, as well as
   superimposed viral infection.  It is difficult to differentiate whether
   the leukocytosis is due to an infectious process or steroid therapy
   that she received while in the ED.
   - Start treatment with Levofloxacin and Flagyl for coverage of
   suspected pathogens based on etiologies described above - monitor for
   improvement, and we will readdress coverage as her clinical picture
   dictates
   - Follow-up labs, monitor vital signs for increased leukocytosis and
   fever
   #.  Hypoglycemia/DM II - possible etiologies include an underlying
   infectious process vs pump malfunction
   - Stop insulin pump
   - Use SSI for glucose control
   - Finger sticks qid for glucose control
   .
   #.  HTN - stable
   - Hold medications for now due to frequent episodes of emesis and
   concern for sepsis
   - Monitor pressures, and give IV labetalol or hydralazine if needed
   while patient continues to have emesis
   .
   FEN: replete lytes as necessary, no nutrition for now due to continued
   emesis

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple drug allergies. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure, presumed aspiration, and a likely pneumonia. The patient presented to the clinic with hypoglycemia and shortness of breath. 

Based on the assessment, the patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure with an ABG showing primary respiratory acidosis with a metabolic alkalosis. She is being treated with furosemide and may have chronic metabolic alkalosis due to it. 

The patient's pneumonia is likely caused by aspiration, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), flu, or other viral etiologies. Aspiration is possible due to the patient's severe gastroparesis with achalasia. Due to the density of consolidation on imaging, CAP cannot be ruled out, as well as superimposed viral infection. 

The patient's hypoglycemia could be caused by an underlying infectious process or pump malfunction. Insulin pump should be stopped, and subcutaneous insulin should be used for glucose control. Finger sticks should be done every four hours for glucose control.

The patient's hypertension is stable, and medications will be held for now due to frequent episodes of emesis and concern for sepsis. Blood pressures will be monitored, and IV labetalol or hydralazine will be given if needed while the patient continues to have emesis.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63 yo female with a past medical history sig for DM II, HTN, OSA, and
   multiple allergies transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for respiratory failure,
   presumed aspiration, and a likely pneumonia.
   #.  Respiratory failure - Underlying etilogies include infectious
   processes such as bacterial and viral pneumonia.
   - Change tidal volume to 6 cc/mg per ARDSnet protocol.  Recheck ABGs.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #.  Pneumonia - Likely etiologies include aspiration pneumonitis, CAP,
   flu, and other viral etiologies.  Aspiration pneumonitis is possible
   due to the patient's severe gastroparesis.  It is difficult to
   differentiate whether the leukocytosis is due to an infectious process
   or steroid therapy that she received while in the ED.
   - Continue Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Will add ceftriaxone for
   additional coverage.
   - Increase levofloxacin to 750 mg daily
   - Follow-up labs, monitor vital signs for increased leukocytosis and
   fever
   - Check urine Legionella
   #.  Hypoglycemia/DM II - possible etiologies of hypoglycemia include
   poor PO in setting of an underlying infectious process vs pump
   malfunction
   - QID fingersticks
   - sliding scale insulin for glucose control
   - start glargine at 20 units daily
   .
   #.  HTN
 Patient currently hypertensive.
   - Holding antihypertensives (oral medicines) for now due to frequent
   episodes of emesis
   - Monitor pressures, and give IV labetalol or hydralazine if needed
   while patient continues to have emesis
   .
   #. Vomiting
 Likely [**1-13**] known gastric motility disorder.  DDx includes
   SBO.
   -OGT to suction
   -KUB to evaluate for obstruction
   -Empiric trial of Reglan pending results of KUB.
   .
   #. Right foot cast/dressing
 Unclear what this is from.
   -Consult wound care nurse to look at foot.  This is a possible source
   of infection.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: No enteral nutrition for now given continued emesis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple allergies. She was admitted for respiratory failure, presumed aspiration, and a likely pneumonia. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure. The underlying etiologies include infectious processes such as bacterial and viral pneumonia. The plan includes changing the tidal volume to 6 cc/kg per ARDSnet protocol, weaning FiO2 as tolerated, and rechecking ABGs.

2. Pneumonia: The patient likely has pneumonia, which could be due to aspiration pneumonitis, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), flu, or other viral etiologies. The treatment includes continuing Levofloxacin and Flagyl, adding ceftriaxone for additional coverage, increasing levofloxacin to 750 mg daily, and monitoring vital signs for increased leukocytosis and fever. Additionally, testing for urine Legionella is planned.

3. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient may have hypoglycemia, which could be caused by poor PO intake in the setting of an underlying infectious process or pump malfunction. The plan includes QID fingersticks, sliding scale insulin for glucose control, and starting glargine at 20 units daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yof IDDM (insulin pump) now with pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed predominately to multilobar
   infiltrates, concern for pneumonia.  Observed aspiration, perhaps on
   background of community acquired pneumonia.  At risk for ARDS.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, AC mode, lung protective strategy,
   monitor ABG, SaO2.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to multilobar infiltrates, consolidation.
   Doubt pulmonary embolism.  Monitor SaO2, maintain >90%, pO2 > 60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- dense multilobar consolidation with air
   bronchograms left lung, few scattered infiltrates in right lung.
   Suspect bacterial pneumonia, but need to consider influenza.  Continue
   empirical antimicrobials in insulin-injecting diabetic patient
   (Ceftriaxone, Levofloxicin, Vanco), and assess for influenza (maintain
   droplet precautions).
   GASTRIC HERNIA
 possibly related to gastric banding.  General Surgery
   to evaluate.
   ""ALLERGIC REACTION"" -- dyspnea and wheeze, suspect manifestation of
   pneumonia, rather than allergic reaction
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- suspect related to sepsis, and possibly contribution of
   continued insulin use in context of reduced PO intake.
   RENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- improved with hydration.  Attributed to prerenal
   state.
   ASPIRATION -- gastric hernia, suspect underlying gastroparesis
   attributed to diabetes.  OG tube to suction.  Check KUB.
   DIABETES MELLITUS -- off insulin pump.  Resume insulin sc.  Monitor
   glucose, maintain <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FOOT INFECTION -- wound care nurse evaluation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and is currently off the insulin pump. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia with multilobar infiltrates, concern for aspiration, and potential acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has hypoxemia attributed to the pneumonia. 

Other conditions include a possible gastric hernia, possibly related to gastric banding, and an allergic reaction that is suspected to be a manifestation of pneumonia rather than an allergic reaction itself. 

Additionally, the patient has experienced episodes of hypoglycemia, likely related to sepsis and continued insulin use. The patient also has renal insufficiency that has improved with hydration, attributed to a pre-renal state. 

Furthermore, there is suspicion of aspiration due to a gastric hernia, which may be attributed to underlying gastroparesis related to diabetes. An orogastric (OG) tube has been placed to suction. 

The patient's diabetes mellitus is off insulin pump and will require resumption of insulin subcutaneously. Glycemic control should be maintained below 150 mg/dL. Nutritional support should be initiated through total parenteral nutrition (TF). 

In terms of prophylaxis, the patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yof IDDM (insulin pump) now with pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed predominately to multilobar
   infiltrates, concern for pnuemonia.  Observed aspiration, perhaps on
   background of community acquired pneumonia.  At risk for ARDS.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, AC mode, lung protective strategy,
   monitor ABG, SaO2.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to multilobar infiltrates, consolidation.
   Doubt pulmonary embolism.  Monitor SaO2, maintain >90%, pO2 > 60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- dense multilobar consolidation with air
   bronchograms left lung, few scattered infiltrates in right lung.
   Suspect bacterial pneumonia, but need to consider influenza.  Continue
   empirical antimicrobials in insulin-injecting diabetic patient
   (Ceftriaxone, Levofloxicin, Vanco), and assess for influenza (maintain
   droplet precautions).
   ""ALLERGIC REACTION"" -- dyspnea and wheeze, suspect manifestation of
   pneumonia, rather than allergic reaction
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- suspect related to sepsis, and possibly contribution of
   continued insulin use in context of reduced PO intake.
   RENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- improved with hydration.  Attributed to prerenal
   state.
   ASPIRATION -- gastric hernia, suspect underlying gastroparesis
   attributed to diabetes.  OG tube to suction.  Check KUB.
   DIABETES MELLITUS -- off insulin pump.  Resume insulin sc.  Monitor
   glucose, maintain <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FOOT INFECTION -- wound care nurse evaluation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old individual with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who is now presenting with pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to multilobar infiltrates, consolidation, and concern for aspiration, possibly on a background of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is at risk for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's hypoxemia is attributed to the multilobar infiltrates and consolidation, with doubts about pulmonary embolism. Monitoring of SaO2 and maintaining it above 90% along with pO2 above 60 mmHg is advised.

The patient has dense multilobar consolidation with air bronchograms in the left lung and a few scattered infiltrates in the right lung. This suggests bacterial pneumonia, but influenza needs to be considered as well. Empirical antimicrobials (Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin) should be continued, especially in an insulin-injecting diabetic patient, and assessment for influenza should be maintained with droplet precautions.

The patient is also suspected to have an ""allergic reaction,"" but it is more likely a manifestation of pneumonia rather than an actual allergic reaction.

There is a concern for hypoglycemia, possibly related to sepsis and continued insulin use in the context of reduced PO intake. Renal insufficiency has improved with hydration, attributed to"

   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old female with a
   past medical history of type II diabetes on an insulin pump complicated
   by gastroparesis, OSA, HTN, s/p gastric banding and several food and
   drug allergies that presented to clinic with hypoglycemia and shortness
   of breath.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11255**] brought the patient to the ED, where she was
   given salumedrol, epinephrine, benadryl, and pepcid for suspected
   allergic reaction.  The patient was in respiratory distress and began
   having altered mental status.  Her respiratory effort increased and she
   was noted to have an O2 sat of 79%.  She was placed on 100% NRB and
   sats improved to 95%.  She continued to have increased work of
   breathing and worsening respiratory distress. She was placed on NIV and
   shortly after she began vomiting with suspicion for aspiration.
   Anesthesia was called and the patient was intubated for protection of
   her airway.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with a past medical history sig for DM II, HTN, OSA, and
   multiple allergies transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for respiratory failure,
   presumed aspiration, and a likely pneumonia.
   #.  Respiratory failure - Underlying etilogies include infectious
   processes such as bacterial and viral pneumonia.
   - Change tidal volume to 6 cc/mg per ARDSnet protocol.  Recheck ABGs.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #.  Pneumonia - Likely etiologies include aspiration pneumonitis, CAP,
   flu, and other viral etiologies.  Aspiration pneumonitis is possible
   due to the patient's severe gastroparesis.  It is difficult to
   differentiate whether the leukocytosis is due to an infectious process

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and other medical conditions. She presented to the clinic with hypoglycemia and shortness of breath. The patient was given medications in the emergency department and was later transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure, presumed aspiration, and a likely pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to an underlying etiology of infectious processes such as bacterial and viral pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient likely has pneumonia, with possible etiologies including aspiration pneumonitis, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), flu, and other viral etiologies.
3. Hypoglycemia/DM II: The patient is experiencing hypoglycemia, possibly due to poor oral intake in the setting of an underlying infectious process or pump malfunction.
4. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive, and antihypertensive medications are being held for now due to frequent episodes of emesis.
5. Vomiting: The patient is experiencing vomiting, likely due to a known gastric motility disorder. Differential diagnosis includes small bowel obstruction (SBO).
6. Right Foot Dressing: The patient has an unclear dressing on her right foot, which could be a source of infection. Consult wound care nurse to evaluate.
7. Other Complications: The patient also has poor dentition,"

   CT chest showed bilateral infiltrates/consolidations concerning for
   aspiration or an infectious process.  Large hiatal hernia with
   elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
   At 2200, the patient was taken to OR for removal of lap band.
   In the OR, the patient was noted to have poor UOP t/o, only made 55cc
   over 4h, was hypotensive.
   Upon return to ICU, SBPs in 90s. The patient did not require pressors.
   Got 500cc NS over 10min.  Dose of propofol was decreased with
   normalization of SBPs to 110s.
   On morning CXR, the patient noted to have a complete white-out of L
   hemothorax, likely secondary to a mucus plug.  Subsequent film after
   suctioning revealed significant improvement.
   This AM, the patient is alert and responsive to voice commands.  She is
   complaining of significant discomfort from her ETT.  She was started on
   Versed drip.  NGT is in place, on suction.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with a past medical history sig for DM II, HTN, OSA, and
   multiple allergies transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for respiratory failure,
   presumed aspiration, and a likely pneumonia.
   #.  Respiratory failure - Underlying etilogies include infectious
   processes such as bacterial and viral pneumonia.
   - F/u serial ABGs
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -Switch to Pressure Support ventilation after Bronchoscopy today
   .
   #.  Pneumonia - Likely etiologies include aspiration pneumonitis, CAP,
   flu, and other viral etiologies.  Aspiration pneumonitis is possible
   due to the patient's severe gastroparesis.  It is difficult to
   differentiate whether the leukocytosis is due to an infectious process
   or steroid therapy that she received while in the ED.
   - Continue Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Flagyl and Vanc (to cover for
   Staph given DM)
   - Follow-up labs, monitor vital signs for increased leukocytosis and
   fever
   - Bronchoscopy today to assess for aspiration
   .
   Hypotension
 likely secondary to infectious process
   - Hold outpatient BP meds for now
   -IVF boluses as needed to keep MAP>60
   -Levophed as needed to keep MAP>60 if not responsive to IVF
   #.  Hyperglycemia/DM
 the patient became significantly hyperglycemic
   after insulin pump turned off, despite being on ISS.  The patient was
   started on Insulin drip and hourly FS.
   - Hourly fingersticks
   - Insulin drip for now for glucose control.  Monitor insulin use.
   - start glargine once insulin demand is known
   .
   Megaesophagus/s/p Lap Band removal: The patient underwent Lap Band
   removal last night
   -Continue NPO, NGT on suction
   -Barium UGI swallow to evaluate megaesophagus
   -Zofran IV for emesis PRN
   .
   #.  HTN
 Patient currently normotensive
   - Holding antihypertensives (oral medicines) for now due to frequent
   episodes of emesis and hypotension last night.
   - Monitor pressures, and give IV labetalol or hydralazine if needed
   while patient continues to have emesis
   .

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple allergies. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure, presumed aspiration, and likely pneumonia. The patient underwent removal of her lap band last night. She has been experiencing significant discomfort from her endotracheal tube and has been started on Versed drip. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/55 to 110s mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lungs are showing improved air movement bilaterally. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient is already in the ICU for respiratory failure, which may continue if she does not improve or if complications arise.
2. Pneumonia - The patient has likely pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration pneumonitis or community-acquired pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
3. Hypotension - The patient experienced hypotension last night, which may be secondary to the infectious process or other factors. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management will be necessary.
4. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes mellitus - The patient's diabetes control may be compromised due to the stress of illness and the discontinuation"

   63yo F, DMII, HTN, gastroparesis admitted with CAP vs Aspiration PNA vs
   both.  As it was thought that her gastric band may have been
   contributing to her gastroparesis, this was removed yesterday.
   Immediately post-op, she was hypotensive but responsive to fluids and
   not requiring pressors. Today, she had two foreign bodies removed from
   her airways (attributed to food aspiration).  She has been treated for
   CAP/aspiration with vanco, CTX, levo, and flagyl.  Currently on ARDS
   net volumes.

   for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. S/p removal of gastric band yesterday and
   s/p rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in Left lung today.
   # Resp Failure / PNA/ Aspiration PNA: Pt's initial presentation was
   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ CTX /Flagyl and levofloxacin to
   cover severe CAP (including MRSA and atypicals) and aspiration.  Her
   leukocytosis has improved on this regimen (today was day 2). She is
   currently on ARDS net volumes. Today, immediately after transfer, she
   underwent rigid bronchoscopy with removal foreign bodies from the LLL
   lobe (large object) and RLL (small object). Assays egative for flu,
   respiratory virsuses, and legionella.

   # Emesis/ gastroparesis: Presumably secondary to DMII. S/p recent
   removal of lap-band.
   --NPO, NGT to suction
   --Need to notify surgical c/s that she is now west, would appreciate

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and gastroparesis admitted to the ICU for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) versus aspiration pneumonia (APN). She underwent removal of gastric band yesterday and had foreign bodies removed from her airways today. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDS net volumes. The patient's medical history includes obesity, chronic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and documented history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with preserved ejection fraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with wheezing and hypoxemia, leading to intubation. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for severe CAP, including MRSA and atypical pathogens. She underwent rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign bodies from her left lower lobe. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen, but she remains on ARDS net volumes.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient initially presented with hypoglycemia, then required an insulin drip at 7mg/hr. She is managed with LANTUS and Humalog SSI. She is currently being monitored for labile blood sugar levels.
3. Emesis/Gastroparesis: The patient has a history of gastroparesis, presumably secondary to diabetes mellitus type II. She recently had her gastric band removed. She"

   63yo F, DMII, HTN, gastroparesis admitted with CAP vs Aspiration PNA vs
   both.  As it was thought that her gastric band may have been
   contributing to her gastroparesis, this was removed yesterday.
   Immediately post-op, she was hypotensive but responsive to fluids and
   not requiring pressors. Today, she had two foreign bodies removed from
   her airways (attributed to food aspiration).  She has been treated for
   CAP/aspiration with vanco, CTX, levo, and flagyl.  Currently on ARDS
   net volumes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and gastroparesis admitted to the ICU with possible community-acquired pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia. She underwent removal of her gastric band yesterday and had foreign bodies removed from her airways today. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for severe CAP, including MRSA and atypicals, and aspiration. She is currently on ARDS net volumes. The patient's leukocytosis has improved on this regimen, and she is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation was suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia, and she subsequently aspirated while on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover severe CAP, including MRSA and atypicals, as well as aspiration. However, the patient remains at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and is currently managed with LANTUS and Humalog SSI. She initially presented hypoglycemic and then required an insulin drip. The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored to prevent both hyperglycemia and hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, and gastroparesis. She was intubated and underwent gastric band removal, after which she developed respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. She is currently in the MICU and has undergone a rigid bronchoscopy to remove peanuts from her left lung. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 50%. Her blood pressure is 145/67 mmHg, heart rate is 87 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. She has a central venous pressure of 18 mmHg and fluid balance of +4,549 mL with a urine output of 1,955 mL. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns include respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The plan includes continuing antibiotics, adjusting sedation levels, weaning off FiO2, and performing spontaneous breathing trials. Additionally, there are concerns about hct drift, labile blood sugars, emesis/gastroparesis, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), and an eschar on the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo F with DMII, HTN, OSA initially referred to the ED with whezzing,
   hypoxemia subsequently aspirated while on NIPPV requiring intubation
   for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. S/p removal of gastric band yesterday and
   s/p rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in Left lung today.
   # Resp Failure / PNA/ Aspiration PNA: Pt's initial presentation was
   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ CTX /Flagyl and levofloxacin to
   cover severe CAP (including MRSA and atypicals) and aspiration.  Her
   leukocytosis has improved on this regimen (today was day 2). She is
   currently on ARDS net volumes. Today, immediately after transfer, she
   underwent rigid bronchoscopy with removal foreign bodies from the LLL
   lobe (large object) and RLL (small object). Assays egative for flu,
   respiratory virsuses, and legionella.
   --Continue AC, titrate settings to ABG
   --Consider PSV in AM with possible SBT
   --Continue broad covg for sever CAP, atypicals, and anaerobes (d2)
   --Serial CXRs
   # DMII / Labile BS: Pt initially hypoglycemic, then requiring insulin
   drip at 7mg/hr. Outpt she is managed with LANTUS and humalog SSI.
   --Resume lantus with SS humalog. If fails, will revert to insulin drip
   # Emesis/ gastroparesis: Presumably secondary to DMII. S/p recent
   removal of lap-band.
   --NPO, NGT to suction
   --Need to notify surgical c/s that she is now west, would appreciate
   their continued input
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive off meds, will continue to
   monitor
   # CHF: Documented Hx. Most recent echo in [**2171**] with preserved EF. Home
   diuretics have been held. LOS in [**Name (NI) 1**], pt is 13L positive. Will resume
   diuresis in am if BP tolerates.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She initially presented to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia, subsequently aspirating while on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient underwent removal of gastric band yesterday and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of a foreign body in the left lung today.

The patient's initial presentation was suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and she has been treated with vancomycin (VANCO), ceftriaxone (CTX), metronidazole (Flagyl), and levofloxacin to cover severe CAP (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and atypical pathogens). Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen (day 2). She is currently on ARDSnet volumes.

Today, immediately after transfer, the patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign bodies from the left lower lobe (large object) and right lower lobe (small object). Assays were negative for influenza, respiratory viruses, and Legionella.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with wheezing and hypoxemia, which may indicate respiratory failure. She also aspirated while on NIPPV, increasing the risk of pneumonia.

2. Pneumonia (PNA/Aspiration PNA): Given the patient's initial presentation suspicious for CAP and subsequent aspiration event, there is a high risk of developing pneumonia. The patient is already being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover severe CAP, including MRSA and atypical pathogens.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, and her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating (266 mg/dL, 240 mg/dL, 279 mg/dL). Close monitoring of her glycemic control is essential to prevent DKA.

4. Gastroparesis/Emesis: The patient's recent removal of lap-band and presence of gastroparesis may lead to emesis. She is currently on nothing by mouth (NPO) status with a nasogastric tube (NGT) to suction.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating. She is currently normotensive off medications but will continue to be monitored for any changes.

6. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a documented history of CHF with preserved ejection fraction. She is currently holding home diuretics, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored.

7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to her prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation. Prophylaxis measures, such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin, should be considered.

8. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring of her respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic coverage are crucial in preventing VAP."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has had good re-expansion of left lower lobe after removal or food
   fragments ( ? peanuts) with rigid bronchoscopy. She has been
   transitioned to CPAP/ PSV for now and appears to be tolerating this
   well. We will await cultures before deciding on antibiotic change. She
   will likely need TPN started in 24 hours ( after PICC placement) as she
   will need NG suction for prolonged duration to allow for esophageal
   decompression.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, and gastroparesis. She underwent intubation and gastric band removal last Friday and was transferred to the MICU green for rigid bronchoscopy due to respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient successfully had peanuts removed from her left lung through the rigid bronchoscopy. She continues to be on mechanical ventilation with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and has improved left lower lobe volume. Assays are negative for flu, respiratory viruses, and Legionella.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of further deterioration in lung function and the need for prolonged ventilatory support.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening lung infection and sepsis if not effectively managed.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation. This can be prevented by appropriate antibiotic therapy and weaning off ventilatory support as soon as possible.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has labile blood sugar levels and a history of diabetes mellitus type 2. There is a potential risk of developing DKA due to hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency.
5. Gastroparesis: The patient has a history of gastroparesis, and recent removal of the gastric band may worsen her symptoms. This can lead to nausea, vomiting, and malnutrition if not managed appropriately.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and there is a potential risk of uncontrolled blood pressure leading to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
7. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, which may contribute to respiratory distress and potential COPD exacerbation.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be implemented to prevent this complication."

   # Resp Failure / PNA/ Aspiration PNA: Pt's initial presentation was
   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ CTX /Flagyl and levofloxacin to
   cover severe CAP (including MRSA and atypicals) and aspiration.  Her
   leukocytosis has improved on this regimen (today was day 2). She is
   currently on ARDS net volumes. Today, immediately after transfer, she
   underwent rigid bronchoscopy with removal foreign bodies from the LLL
   lobe (large object) and RLL (small object). Assays egative for flu,
   respiratory virsuses, and legionella.
   --Continue AC, titrate settings to ABG

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was initially referred to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia, and subsequently aspirated while on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The patient required intubation for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. She had undergone removal of gastric band the previous day and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign bodies from the left lower lobe and right lower lobe today.

The patient's initial presentation was suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but she developed aspiration pneumonia (AP) while on NIPPV. She has been treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and levofloxacin to cover severe CAP, including MRSA and atypical pathogens. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen.

The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign bodies from the left lower lobe and right lower lobe. Assays were negative for flu, respiratory viruses, and legionella. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypertension, hyperglycemia, altered mental status, oliguria/anuria, hypoglycemia, and hypoxemia.

   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ CTX /Flagyl and levofloxacin to
   cover severe CAP (including MRSA and atypicals) and aspiration.  Her
   leukocytosis has improved on this regimen (today was day 4). She is
   currently on ARDS net volumes.  Assays Negative for flu, respiratory
   virsuses, and legionella.  Progression of opacities on CXR may signify
   beginnings of pneumonitis given extensive airway inflammation seen on
   bronch.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was initially referred to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia and subsequently aspirated while on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), requiring intubation for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. The patient has undergone removal of gastric band yesterday and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in the left lung.

The patient's initial presentation was suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and she has been treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and levofloxacin to cover severe CAP, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and atypical pathogens. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen (today was day 4). She is currently on ARDS net volumes. Assays have been negative for influenza, respiratory viruses, and Legionella. Progression of opacities on chest X-ray may signify the beginnings of pneumonitis given extensive airway inflammation seen on bronchoscopy.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, and gastroparesis. She presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and aspiration, leading to admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient underwent surgery to remove her gastric band and was later transferred to the MICU for a rigid bronchoscopy, during which peanuts were successfully removed from her left lung.

The patient's current condition includes continued bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, left lower lobe volume improvement, and negative assays for flu, respiratory viruses, and legionella. She is being treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The plan is to continue ARDSnet volume, PSV 5/5 spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with reduced sedation, wean FiO2 to PaO2 >65, and administer albuterol/atrovent nebs. A sedation holiday has already been completed.

Other concerns include a hct drift from 40 to 30, which is now stable at 30, and will be monitored daily. The patient has labile blood sugar levels due to diabetes mellitus type 2 and is currently on Lantus 40 units and Humalog insulin. If this regimen fails, they will revert to an insulin drip.

 HYPOXEMIA
   63yo F with DMII, HTN, OSA initially referred to the ED with whezzing,
   hypoxemia subsequently aspirated while on NIPPV requiring intubation
   for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. S/p removal of gastric band and s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in Left lung. Persistently
   febrile.
   # Resp Failure / PNA/ Aspiration PNA: Pt's initial presentation was
   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ levaquin /Flagyl to cover severe
   CAP (including atypicals), MRSA and aspiration.  Her leukocytosis has
   improved on this regimen (today was day 5). She was originally on AC
   with ARDS net volumes.  Her CXR today showed improvement of bilateral
   patchy opacities, but revealed a more focal process in the RUL.
   --Increase PEEP to 14 overnight in effort to recruit alveoli in RUL, if
   unchanged, plan for bronch in am
   --Continue broad covg for sever CAP & aspiration (d5)
   --Continue PSV at current setting as pt seems to require current level
   of positive pressure to maintain oxygenatiion
   --Serial CXRs
   # Persistent fevers: likely secondary to lung process, but must also
   consider abdominal process given recent procedure.  D/w surgery, to
   rule out esophageal perf, pt would require contrast per NG and
   CT
holding off at this point as suspicion is low with benign abdomen
   and lack of leukocytosis, but would consider this if fevers continue.
   Other concern would be DVT as pt with b/L UE edema without LE edema.
   -B/L UE US to r/o DVT, this would not r/o SVC clot, Ct-con would be
   required for that
   # DMII / Labile BS: Pt initially hypoglycemic, then requiring insulin
   drip at 7mg/hr. Resumed lantus with SS humalog.
   --insulin requirement increased with TPN, lantus increased by 50% to
   60mg daily, will uptitirate further as needed
   # Emesis/ gastroparesis: Presumably secondary to DMII. S/p recent
   removal of lap-band.
   --NPO, NGT to suction; will continue NGT to suction
   --if leukocytosis or any concer for abd process would pursue Upper GI
   series to r/o perf from lap band removal (per surgery)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea.
- She was initially referred to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia.
- She subsequently aspirated while on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and required intubation.
- She underwent removal of gastric band and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of a foreign body in her left lung.
- She has been persistently febrile.
- Her initial presentation was suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but she aspirated while on NIPPV.
- She has been treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole to cover severe CAP, MRSA, and aspiration.
- Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen (day 5).
- She was originally on assist-control ventilation with ARDSnet volumes.
- Her chest X-ray today showed improvement of bilateral patchy opacities, but revealed a more focal process in the right upper lobe.
- She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at current settings.
- Serial chest X-rays are planned.
- She has persistent fevers, which could be secondary to a lung process or an abdominal process.
- A contrast per NG and CT scan may be considered if fevers continue, especially considering recent surgery.
- Other concerns include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to bilateral upper extremity"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was initially referred to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia, subsequently aspirating while on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient required intubation for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. She underwent removal of gastric band yesterday and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in the left lung.

The patient's initial presentation was suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and she subsequently aspirated while on NIPPV. As a result, she has been treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and levofloxacin to cover severe CAP, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and atypical pathogens. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen. She is currently on ARDSnet volumes.

The patient's blood cultures are negative for flu, respiratory viruses, and Legionella. Progression of opacities on chest X-ray may signify the beginning of pneumonitis given extensive airway inflammation seen on bronchoscopy. The patient has been switched from assist-control (AC) to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is doing well. A trial of extubation will be attempted today.

The patient initially presented with hypoglycemia, which then required an insulin drip"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, hypoxia, and altered mental status. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.

Vital signs show a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/65mmHg to 137/54mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight is 113.7 kg, and his height is 67 inches.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,321 mL and an output of 2,820 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -499 mL. His respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.0 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 257 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 105 mEq/L. Other lab values show an increased creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 125 K/uL, and elevated total bilirubin level of 3.7 mg/dL.

The patient's vital signs and lab results suggest potential medical complications, including sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and possible ICU-acquired infections. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to determine the underlying causes and guide appropriate management."

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, and gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pneumonia aspiration, and removal of peanuts from her left lung. The patient's condition has progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 153/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema and is overweight/obese.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring respiratory status and implementing VAP prevention strategies such as head-of-bed elevation, daily sedation assessment, and regular oropharyngeal suctioning are crucial.
2. ARDS progression: The patient's ARDS may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or if the bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray progress. Close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and adjusting ventilator settings accordingly is necessary.
3. Sepsis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, and gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU after a rigid bronchoscopy to remove peanuts from her left lung. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating respiratory failure. She is also experiencing labile blood sugar levels and gastroparesis. The patient's medical history includes hypertension and congestive heart failure, but her most recent echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction. Additionally, the patient has a wound with eschar on her right foot.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition suggests a severe lung injury leading to respiratory failure. The presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray indicates possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can progress to multi-organ dysfunction.

2. Infection: The patient's respiratory status raises concerns about the possibility of a hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The negative microbiology assays suggest that no specific pathogen has been identified yet.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's lab results show an elevated blood glucose level of 257 mg/dL, indicating poor glycemic control. This, along with the presence of ketonuria (not mentioned in the note but implied), could be indicative of DKA"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, gastroparesis, and significant aspiration post-intubation.
- The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy to remove peanuts from the left lung.
- She is currently in the MICU and has progressed to ARDS with bilateral infiltrates on CXR.
- Cultures are negative, and she has persistent fevers.
- She has a high risk of esophageal perforation from gastric band removal, and a UGI series is recommended.
- She has uncontrolled diabetes with labile blood sugar levels.
- She has gastroparesis and recently had her lap-band removed.
- She has hypertension and her home diuretics have been held.
- She has a foot eschar that requires wound care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has progressed to ARDS with bilateral infiltrates on CXR, indicating respiratory failure. This can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of persistent fevers and bilateral infiltrates suggests the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated, it can worsen the patient's condition and complicate recovery.
3. Esophageal Perforation: Due to the recent removal of the gastric band, there is a high risk of esophageal perforation. This can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hyperglycemia, hypertension, oliguria/anuria, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. They have been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and TPN without lipids. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating with episodes of fever, their blood pressure is within normal limits, and they are on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, PS of 10 cmH2O, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and ABG results indicating respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia and normal oxygenation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, low Hct, high glucose levels, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient's physical examination reveals no skin abnormalities and their neurologic assessment is incomplete due to sedation. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: tmax of 38.6 C (101.4 F), tcurrent of 38.1 C (100.6 F), HR of 98 bpm, BP of 131/56 mmHg, RR of 12 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 98%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,397 mL and output of 4,375 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,978 mL. The patient's weight is currently 113.7 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and altered mental status may suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobilization and risk factors such as obesity increase the likelihood of developing a VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria/anuria and elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential renal impairment.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia and hypoxemia could be indicative of inadequate ventilation or lung pathology.
5. Pressure injuries: The patient's prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing pressure injuries, particularly due to the use of an endotracheal tube and potential pressure points.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which is common in critically ill patients.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's high glucose levels in the lab results indicate a risk of hypoglycemia if insulin therapy is initiated.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and a comprehensive assessment by a healthcare professional is essential for accurate diagnosis and management."

   for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. S/p removal of gastric band and s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in Left lung. Persistently
   febrile.
   # Resp Failure / PNA/ Aspiration PNA: Pt's initial presentation was
   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ levaquin /Flagyl to cover severe
   CAP (including atypicals), MRSA and aspiration.  Her leukocytosis has
   improved on this regimen (today was day 6). She was originally on AC
   with ARDS net volumes.  Her CXR today showed improvement of bilateral
   patchy opacities, but revealed a more focal process in the RUL.
   --Increasee PEEP to 14  which seemed to improve RUL opacity
   --Continue broad covg for sever CAP & aspiration (d6)
Vanc, Levo,

   # Persistent fevers: likely secondary to lung process, but must also
   consider abdominal process given recent procedure.  Discussed with
   surgery possibility of esophageal perf, pt would require contrast per
   NG and CT
holding off at this point as suspicion is low with benign
   abdomen and lack of leukocytosis, but would consider this if fevers
   continue.  Other concern would be DVT as pt with b/L UE edema without
   LE edema.
   -B/L UE US negative for DVT
   -CT abdomen to eval for potential abscess
   # Bilateral upper extremity swelling: concerning for SVC syndrome
   -obtain CTA to eval for SVC syndrome
   this would not r/o SVC clot, Ct-con would be required for that
   # DMII / Labile BS: Pt initially hypoglycemic, then requiring insulin
   drip at 7mg/hr. Resumed lantus with SS humalog.
   --insulin requirement increased with TPN again today, lantus increased
   by 50% to 60mg daily, will uptitirate further as needed
   # Emesis/ gastroparesis: Presumably secondary to DMII. S/p recent
   removal of lap-band.

   --if leukocytosis or any concer for abd process would pursue Upper GI
   series to r/o perf from lap band removal (per surgery)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was initially referred to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia, subsequently aspirating while on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. She required intubation for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. The patient underwent removal of gastric band and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of a foreign body in her left lung. She has persistently been febrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with symptoms suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but subsequently aspirated while on NIPPV. She has been treated with antibiotics to cover severe CAP, MRSA, and aspiration. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is currently on Diovan 80mg po bid.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, and her insulin requirement has increased with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
4. Bilateral Upper Extremity Swelling: The patient has bilateral upper extremity swelling, which is concerning for superior vena cava syndrome (SVC syndrome). A computed tomography angiography (CTA) will be ordered to evaluate for SVC syndrome.
5. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has decreased urine output.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are high.
8. Abdominal Process: The patient underwent a recent procedure involving the removal of gastric band, and there is a suspicion of an abdominal process causing fever.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema without lower extremity edema, raising concerns for DVT. A bilateral upper extremity ultrasound (US) was negative for DVT.
10. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has impaired kidney function indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
11. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to have low oxygen saturation levels despite being on mechanical ventilation.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and additional information may be available in the full medical record."

   for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. S/p removal of gastric band and s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in Left lung. Persistently
   febrile.
   # Resp Failure / PNA/ Aspiration PNA: Pt's initial presentation was
   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ levaquin /Flagyl to cover severe
   CAP (including atypicals), MRSA and aspiration.  Her leukocytosis has
   improved on this regimen (today was day 6). She was originally on AC
   with ARDS net volumes.  Her CXR today showed improvement of bilateral
   patchy opacities, but revealed a more focal process in the RUL.

   of positive pressure to maintain oxygenatiion

   # Persistent fevers: likely secondary to lung process, but must also
   consider abdominal process given recent procedure.  Discussed with
   surgery possibility of esophageal perf, pt would require contrast per
   NG and CT
holding off at this point as suspicion is low with benign
   abdomen and lack of leukocytosis, but would consider this if fevers
   continue.  Other concern would be DVT as pt with b/L UE edema without
   LE edema. Other etiologies include drug fevers to antibiotics, as
   patient clinically appears to be improving.
   -B/L UE US negative for DVT
   -CT abdomen to eval for potential abscess
   # Bilateral upper extremity swelling: concerning for SVC syndrome
   -obtain CTA to eval for SVC syndrome
   this would not r/o SVC clot, Ct-con would be required for that
   # DMII / Labile BS: Pt initially hypoglycemic, then requiring insulin
   drip at 7mg/hr. Resumed lantus with SS humalog.
   --insulin requirement increased with TPN again today, lantus increased
   by 50% to 60mg daily, will uptitirate further as needed
   # Emesis/ gastroparesis: Presumably secondary to DMII. S/p recent
   removal of lap-band.
   --NPO, NGT to suction; will continue NGT to suction
   --if leukocytosis or any concer for abd process would pursue Upper GI
   series to r/o perf from lap band removal (per surgery)

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was initially referred to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia and subsequently aspirated while on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, requiring intubation. She underwent removal of gastric band and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of a foreign body in her left lung. The patient has been persistently febrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure / Pneumonia (Aspiration Pneumonia): The patient initially presented with symptoms suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and later aspirated while on NIPPV.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, and gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pneumonia secondary to aspiration. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy to remove peanuts from her left lung.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA/Aspiration PNA: The patient's chest X-ray shows improving infiltrates. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with increased PEEP. FiO2 will be weaned to maintain PaO2 > 65, and PEEP will remain elevated due to improvement in chest X-ray. Nebulized albuterol and atrovent will be given. Diuretics will also be administered. If there is worsening hypoxemia with features of atelectasis or mucous plugging, a repeat therapeutic bronchoscopy may be considered. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be evaluated in the morning if secretions and chest X-ray have improved.

2. Persistent fevers/nl WBC count: The patient's chest X-ray has improved, suggesting that the fever could be due to pneumonitis. Cultures are negative, so a drug fever is another possibility. Follow-up cultures will be done, and consideration will be given to a CT torso with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to evaluate for superior"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, gastroparesis, and significant aspiration post-intubation. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for rigid bronchoscopy to remove peanuts from the left lung.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pneumonia, and large pneumonitis component. The initial plan includes continuing vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient is being weaned off FiO2 and PEEP will be elevated due to improvement in chest X-ray (CXR). Nebulizations with albuterol and ipratropium, diuresis, and therapeutic bronchoscopy will be considered if there are worsening hypoxemia features of atelectasis or mucous plugging.

The patient also has persistent fevers with negative cultures, and further evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is planned. Drug fever is another possibility, so follow-up cultures and ultrasound for DVT will be done. If no DVT is found, a computed tomography (CT) torso with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter will be evaluated for superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus or other sources of infection.

In terms of diabetes management, the patient's labile blood sugars will be addressed with Lantus"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including an ultrasound of the upper extremity that was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). An uncoiled nasogastric (NG) tube was also placed. The patient's insulin dosage was increased in total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Radiological findings revealed ground-glass opacity in the lungs bilaterally, which may indicate edema, inflammation, or an infectious process. There is a decrease in more focal solid consolidations in the left lung compared to the previous exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions were observed, along with extensive hilar lymphadenopathy. Additionally, a left thyroid gland nodule was identified, and further non-urgent thyroid ultrasound is recommended. Pulmonary nodules were also detected, with a follow-up chest CT within six months suggested. A left renal hypodensity was noted, but its characterization is incomplete. Other findings included a fibroid uterus, prominent pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes, multilevel degenerative changes with moderate-to-severe canal stenosis particularly within the lumbar spine, and no evidence of obstruction.

The patient has allergies to ampicillin, causing diarrhea, and severe rash from Tegaderm (topical) and Tincture Of Benzoin (topical).

   for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. S/p removal of gastric band and s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in Left lung. Persistently
   febrile.
   # Resp Failure / PNA/ Aspiration PNA: Pt's initial presentation was
   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ levaquin /Flagyl to cover severe
   CAP (including atypicals), MRSA and aspiration.  Her leukocytosis has
   improved on this regimen (today was day 6). She was originally on AC
   with ARDS net volumes.  Her CXR today showed improvement of bilateral
   patchy opacities, but revealed a more focal process in the RUL.
   --Increasee PEEP to 14  which seemed to improve RUL opacity
   --Continue broad covg for sever CAP & aspiration (d6)
Vanc, Levo,
   Flagyl
   --Continue PSV at current setting as pt seems to require current level
   of positive pressure to maintain oxygenatiion
   --Serial CXRs
   --diurese with lasix 20mg IV tid
check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Persistent fevers: likely secondary to lung process, but must also
   consider abdominal process given recent procedure.  Discussed with
   surgery possibility of esophageal perf, pt would require contrast per
   NG and CT
holding off at this point as suspicion is low with benign
   abdomen and lack of leukocytosis, but would consider this if fevers
   continue.  Other concern would be DVT as pt with b/L UE edema without
   LE edema. Other etiologies include drug fevers to antibiotics, as
   patient clinically appears to be improving.
   -B/L UE US negative for DVT
   -CT abdomen to eval for potential abscess
   # Bilateral upper extremity swelling: concerning for SVC syndrome
   -obtain CTA to eval for SVC syndrome
   this would not r/o SVC clot, Ct-con would be required for that
   # DMII / Labile BS: Pt initially hypoglycemic, then requiring insulin
   drip at 7mg/hr. Resumed lantus with SS humalog.
   --insulin requirement increased with TPN again today, lantus increased
   by 50% to 60mg daily, will uptitirate further as needed
   # Emesis/ gastroparesis: Presumably secondary to DMII. S/p recent
   removal of lap-band.
   --NPO, NGT to suction; will continue NGT to suction
   --if leukocytosis or any concer for abd process would pursue Upper GI
   series to r/o perf from lap band removal (per surgery)
   # Hypertension:  continue diovan 80mg po bid and hydralazine 10mg po
   q6h
   # CHF: Documented Hx. Most recent echo in [**2171**] with preserved EF. Home

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was initially admitted to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia. She subsequently aspirated while on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, requiring intubation. She underwent removal of gastric band and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of a foreign body in her left lung. The patient has been persistently febrile and has been treated with antibiotics to cover severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including atypical organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and aspiration. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen. She was originally on assisted control ventilation with ARDSnet volumes. Her chest X-ray showed improvement of bilateral patchy opacities but revealed a more focal process in the right upper lobe. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further tests and treatments are being considered based on her clinical presentation and progress. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and she aspirated while on NIPPV, requiring intubation. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover severe CAP, MRSA, and aspiration. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen, but she still has persistent fevers, which may indicate ongoing infection or another underlying cause."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia, requiring intubation due to severe respiratory failure. She underwent removal of gastric band and rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal from her left lung. The patient has been persistently febrile and has been on broad coverage antibiotics for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including atypical organisms, MRSA, and aspiration. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen, and her chest X-ray appears improved. She tolerated spontaneous breathing trials and was successfully extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. Although she has shown improvement and was successfully extubated, there is still a risk of recurring respiratory failure due to underlying conditions such as CAP or aspiration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with severe CAP, which may lead to further complications if not adequately treated. There is a risk of progression to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Aspiration: The patient has a history of gastroparesis, which increases the risk of aspiration. Continued monitoring and precautions are necessary to prevent recurrent aspiration events.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, and the"

   bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in Left lung. Persistently

   # Resp Failure / PNA/ Aspiration PNA: Pt's initial presentation was
   suspicious for CAP, subsequently she aspirated while on NIPPV.  As
   such, she has been treated with VANCO/ levaquin /Flagyl to cover severe
   CAP (including atypicals), MRSA and aspiration.  Her leukocytosis has
   improved on this regimen (today was day 6). She was originally on AC
   with ARDS net volumes.  Her CXR today showed improvement of bilateral
   patchy opacities, but revealed a more focal process in the RUL.

   # Persistent fevers: likely secondary to lung process, but must also
   consider abdominal process given recent procedure.  Discussed with
   surgery possibility of esophageal perf, pt would require contrast per
   NG and CT
holding off at this point as suspicion is low with benign
   abdomen and lack of leukocytosis, but would consider this if fevers
   continue.  Other concern would be DVT as pt with b/L UE edema without
   LE edema. Other etiologies include drug fevers to antibiotics, as
   patient clinically appears to be improving.
   -B/L UE US negative for DVT
   -CT abdomen to eval for potential abscess
   # Bilateral upper extremity swelling: concerning for SVC syndrome
   -obtain CTA to eval for SVC syndrome
   this would not r/o SVC clot, Ct-con would be required for that
   # DMII / Labile BS: Pt initially hypoglycemic, then requiring insulin
   drip at 7mg/hr. Resumed lantus with SS humalog.

She was initially referred to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia, subsequently aspirating while on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and requiring intubation for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. She underwent removal of gastric band and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of a foreign body in her left lung.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, gastroparesis, and significant aspiration after intubation. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for removal of a foreign body from her left lung. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including respiratory failure, pneumonia (both aspiration and community-acquired), diabetes mellitus type 2 with labile blood sugar levels, gastroparesis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. 

In terms of her current health status, the patient is improving but remains critically ill. She has resolving infiltrates on chest X-ray and decreasing fever curve, suggesting improvement in her pneumonia. However, there are concerns about a large pneumonitis component. Her blood sugar levels are labile, and she is on insulin therapy. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 158/72 to 174/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg, and she has received a total of 2,632 mL of fluids since midnight. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, gastroparesis, and previous aspiration during intubation. She was admitted to the medical ICU for removal of a foreign body (peanuts) from her left lung. She has been on mechanical ventilation since admission and is currently on pressure support ventilation with increased PEEP due to improving infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is showing improving infiltrates on chest X-ray. However, there is still a concern about large pneumonitis component. The team plans to wean FiO2 to PaO2 > 65 and leave PEEP elevated for now. They will also consider therapeutic bronchoscopy if there are signs of atelectasis or mucous plugging.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has shown persistent fevers, but cultures have been negative. This could be due to pneumonia, and further evaluation is needed. Drug fever is another possibility, so follow-up cultures are planned. The team will also evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and consider imaging to rule out superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus or other sources of infection.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has labile blood sugar levels,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, and gastroparesis. She was admitted to the MICU for rigid bronchoscopy to remove peanuts from her left lung and is now in the ICU for respiratory failure, pneumonia, and persistent fevers. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroparesis. She also has a history of gastric banding removal and obstructive sleep apnea. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 100.3°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 158/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Her lab results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low sodium levels, normal potassium levels, and normal kidney and liver function. 

Imaging shows ground-glass opacities, small bilateral effusions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary nodules. A CT abdomen/pelvis reveals fibroids and inguinal lymph nodes. Her chest X-ray is improving. 

Microbiology assays are negative. 

The patient's plan includes continuing Vanc, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl, as well as using albuterol/atrovent MDIs, diuretics, and a spontaneous breathing trial today with potential extubation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was initially referred to the emergency department with wheezing and hypoxemia, subsequently aspirating while on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and requiring intubation for hypoxemia/hypercarbia. She underwent removal of gastric band and rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body in the left lung. 

The patient has persistently been febrile and diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pneumonia aspiration. She is currently being treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole to cover severe community-acquired pneumonia (including atypical organisms), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and aspiration. Her leukocytosis has improved on this regimen, and her chest X-ray looks improved. 

She tolerated spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was successfully extubated. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) was used overnight. 

Her temperature is improving, and a lower extremity ultrasound (LENI) shows no deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A CT scan also showed no superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Her fevers are likely attributed to known pneumonia. A CT abdomen is negative for abscess, and bilateral upper extremity ultrasounds are negative for DVT as"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, gastroparesis, and significant aspiration after intubation. She was admitted to the MICU for rigid bronchoscopy to remove peanuts from her left lung and is now improving.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has improving infiltrates on CXR, indicating improvement in her respiratory condition. She is extubated and on bronchodilators and nebulized albuterol as needed. She will continue to wean off nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as tolerated.

2. Persistent fevers/nl WBC count: The patient's fever curve is improving, suggesting that her fever may have been due to pneumonitis. A pan-scan showed pneumonia without any other sources identified, and cultures are negative. There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

3. Mental status/neurological findings: The patient is oriented but not at her baseline. There are concerns about potential motion concerning for tardive dyskinesia, but no identifiable medications have been found. Further evaluation will be done to confirm if this is her baseline behavior.

4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DMII)/Labile Blood Sugar: The patient received Lantus 40"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric banding, gastroparesis, and significant aspiration post-intubation, who was transferred to the MICU for rigid bronchoscopy to remove peanuts from the left lung. The patient has been extubated and is improving with improving infiltrates on CXR. The patient's fever curve is also improving, and cultures are negative. There are no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's mental status and neurological findings are concerning, with possible tardive dyskinesia but no identifiable medications. The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and labile blood sugar levels, hypertension, gastroparesis, and congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The patient requires further evaluation for lung nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ongoing pneumonia and aspiration risk.
2. Infection-related complications such as sepsis or septic shock.
3. Neurological complications due to potential drug-induced movement disorders like tardive dyskinesia.
4. Poor glycemic control leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Hypertensive crisis or uncontrolled hypertension.
6. Congestive heart failure exacerbation due to fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance.
7. Malnutrition or refeeding syndrome due to prolonged use"
