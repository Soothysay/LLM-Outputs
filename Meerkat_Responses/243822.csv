","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis and previous treatment for esophageal and rectal variceal hemorrhages. He presents with continued bleeding from rectal varices, as evidenced by bright red blood per rectum during rounds. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 131/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and sinus rhythm. He has a history of angioedema with lisinopril use and has received ceftriaxone, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. 

The patient's lab results show elevated hemolysis, falsely elevating potassium levels. His serum EtOH level is 57, which indicates recent alcohol consumption. Tricyclic antidepressant levels are positive, representing potentially toxic levels. Other lab values such as sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and albumin are within normal ranges. However, his PT, PTT, and INR values are elevated, indicating impaired liver function.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of rectal variceal hemorrhage with a call for a stat colonoscopy, tagged red blood cell scan, transfusion of additional blood products, and serial hemoglobin checks. He is also being treated with proton pump inhibitors, oct"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, who presents with continued bloody red brown pigmentary stools (BRBPR). He has had esophageal and rectal variceal hemorrhages in the past and has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 131/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and sinus rhythm. The patient is not in acute distress, with no jugular venous distention (JVD) observed. His lungs show bilateral coarse crackles (CTA). There are no signs of abdominal tenderness or distension, and he has 2+ deep tendon reflexes without edema. Laboratory results indicate hemolysis with falsely elevated potassium levels, negative serum ethanol, and positive tricyclic antidepressant levels. His coagulation profile shows a prothrombin time (PT) of 17.1, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 29.3, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is likely experiencing a lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) due to the presence of BRBPR and hemodynamic stability. The most likely source of the bleed is rect"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic. He was admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding, which has resulted in a drop in hemoglobin levels and the need for blood transfusions. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/60 to 139/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is receiving octreotide infusion for variceal bleeding and has received multiple units of packed red blood cells overnight. He has also been given 5mg of vitamin K.

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), low platelet count (86 K/uL), low hemoglobin (10.1 g/dL), low sodium (24 mEq/L), normal potassium (3.9 mEq/L), elevated bilirubin (27.3%), and elevated INR (1.6). The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4072 mL and output of 1000 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3072 mL.

The patient's past medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholic hepatitis. His review of systems is unchanged from admission. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular status, skin condition,"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and previous episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with continued bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and is currently in the ICU. The patient has undergone an ultrasound, which showed normally functioning transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and an endoscopy that revealed hemorrhoids but no active bleeding. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight, resulting in an increased hematocrit (Hct) level of 32.6. He also received 5 mg of vitamin K.

The patient has allergies to lisinopril, which caused angioedema, and is currently on several medications including octreotide, carafate, and pantoprazole. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 98 bpm with a range of 83-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 68-139 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 13-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,072 mL, including 171 mL of blood products, and an output of 1,000 mL, with a urine output of 400 mL. The patient is not experiencing any respiratory distress and is not on supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals bilateral coarse crackles in the lungs, no jugular venous distention, and no evidence of abdominal distention or edema.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 86 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and an elevated bilirubin level of 27.3%. The patient's blood glucose level is 93 mg/dL, and his INR is elevated at 1.6.

The patient's assessment includes ongoing BRBPR, stable hemodynamics, and a need for further evaluation and management. The plan includes calling gastroenterology for a stat colonoscopy, tagging red blood cells for transfusion, and transfusing additional blood products as necessary. The patient is also on prophylactic antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, proton pump inhibitor therapy, octreotide, and continues to have his sucralate and iron supplements. The patient is nil per os (NPO) for possible colonoscopy/endoscopic gastrointestinal duplication (EGD)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who presented with significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion in the past 24 hours and has maintained a hematocrit (HCT) level of 28%. Hemorrhoids were seen on flexible sigmoidoscopy, but the exact source of the bleeding has not been definitively identified.

Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient's presentation with significant GI bleed is a medical complication that requires immediate attention. The source of the bleeding is still uncertain, and further diagnostic procedures, such as colonoscopy, are planned to confirm the timing and location of the bleed.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which is a chronic liver disease characterized by scarring of the liver tissue. Cirrhosis can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and increased susceptibility to infections.

3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's vital signs indicate low blood pressure (BP) ranging from 107/56 mmHg to 128/84 mmHg, suggesting possible hemodynamic instability due to the ongoing blood loss. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 86 K"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, complicated by esophageal and rectal variceal hemorrhages. He has undergone a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient presents with continued bleeding, resulting in a low hematocrit level of 22%. He has bright red blood per rectum, and flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed hemorrhoids, but they are not believed to be the source of the bleeding. The patient is refusing a colonoscopy and wishes to leave against medical advice (AMA). He is critically ill and requires life-sustaining blood transfusions to maintain his hematocrit above 25%. Other medical issues include diabetes mellitus, ethanol abuse, and potential small bowel perforation (SBP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient's low hematocrit level indicates ongoing bleeding. If not controlled, this could lead to hemorrhagic shock and organ failure.
2. Refusal of colonoscopy: By refusing the procedure, the patient may be missing an opportunity to identify the source of the bleeding, which could worsen his condition if it is not from the identified hemorrhoids.
3. Ethanol abuse: The patient's continued drinking poses a risk for further liver damage and exacerbation of his cirrhosis, potentially leading to hepatic encephalopathy and other complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis who presents with continued bleeding from esophageal and rectal varices despite previous treatment. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage: The patient's continued bleeding from esophageal and rectal varices poses a high risk for further hemorrhage. Close monitoring of vital signs and quick response to any signs of hemodynamic instability is crucial.
2. Infection: The patient has been started on ceftriaxone for prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), indicating an increased risk of infection due to cirrhosis. Regular assessment for signs of infection and prompt treatment is necessary.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although not currently evident, the patient's continued alcohol consumption puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring mental status and providing appropriate interventions to prevent this complication is important.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and the use of glipizide (a medication to control blood sugar levels) indicate a risk for hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's history of alcohol use and cirrhosis may lead to electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as needed is important to prevent complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, complicated by esophageal and rectal variceal hemorrhages. He has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient presents with continued bleeding from the rectum, and his hemoglobin level has dropped below 25. He is currently receiving transfusions as needed to maintain a hematocrit level above 25%. Surgical consult has been obtained, and hemorrhoids have been ruled out as the source of bleeding. The patient has been started on a bowel regimen and surgical cellulose packing to the anus if rebleeding occurs. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy have been recommended. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) needs to be corrected. The plan is to perform the colonoscopy prep overnight, with the scope likely being done tomorrow. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for the possible colonoscopy/EGD. He is receiving octreotide, pantoprazole, ceftriaxone, carafate, and iron supplements. The patient continues to drink alcohol and shows no evidence of ascites or encephalopathy. He requires monitoring of his blood glucose levels, repletion of electrolytes, and is NPO.
