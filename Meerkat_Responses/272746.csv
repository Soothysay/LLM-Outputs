","The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). He has been experiencing worsening altered mental status, tachypnea, and fevers. The patient was found intoxicated and lying outside by his daughter, and at the emergency department, he was found to have a small right intraparenchymal hemorrhage and SAH. He was loaded with phenytoin and transferred to Hospital1. Neurosurgery did not operate, and his mental status has been stable. He has been febrile for a few days and has sputum positive for gram-negative rods (GNRs). He has been prescribed vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin for presumed pneumonia, although his chest X-ray was benign. He also has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 128 on 3/28/2177. He has not required CIWA. He was transferred to medicine for further management. On the evening of 3/28/2177, the patient became tachypneic and unresponsive. A head CT showed a stable bleed, and a chest CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed likely aspirated material in the right bronchus.

","The patient is a 76-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a history of SAH, IPH, and now presenting with worsening altered mental status, tachypnea, and fevers. He has a history of EtOH abuse and was found intoxicated outside by his daughter. He was taken to OSH where a small right intraparenchymal hemorrhage and SAH were identified. He was loaded with phenytoin and transferred to Hospital1 for further management. Neurosurg did not operate, and his MS has been stable. The patient is currently on the following medications: Vanc/ceft/azithro for presumed PNA, despite a benign CXR. He also has Na 128 and has not required CIWA. The patient was transferred to the medicine service for further management.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: he has been febrile for the past few days, with sputum positive for GNRs. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/57 to 135/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and has an ABG showing pH 7.44, PaCO2 35 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 209.

Physical examination reveals stable vital signs, with no significant abnormalities noted in the HEENT, CV, PULM, ABD, EXTREM, and neuro examinations. The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 18.2 K/uL, hematocrit of 34.0%, platelet count of 243 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, total CO2 of 25 mEq/L, glucose of 139 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 0.9 mmol/L. Other labs include PT/PTT/INR of 12.2/25.8/1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T of 132/0, calcium of 8.9 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.9 mg/dL.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Tachypnea: The patient has an increased respiratory rate, which could be due to a pulmonary embolism (PE), but the chest CTA was negative. There is no clear evidence of pneumonia, but the patient might have an acute primary CNS process. Supplemental oxygen should be provided as needed.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is stable, but there are concerns for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin release syndrome, seizures, withdrawal, or other causes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man admitted to the MICU for worsening altered mental status, tachypnea, and fevers. He was found intoxicated outside by his daughter and was brought to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a small right intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). He has been loaded with phenytoin and transferred to Hospital1. Neurosurgery did not operate, and his motor strength has been stable. The patient is oriented to person and place but not to date. He has had fevers and positive sputum for Gram-negative rods (GNRs). He has been prescribed Vanc, ceft/azithro for presumed pneumonia, despite having a benign chest X-ray. The patient's sodium level on 03/28/2177 was 128. He did not require CIWA. He was transferred to medicine for further management. On the evening of 03/28/2177, the patient became tachypneic and unresponsive. A head CT showed a stable bleed, and a chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed likely aspirated material in the right bronchus. The patient was admitted to the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of tachypnea, fevers, and positive sputum for GNRs indicate a possible pneumonia. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, tachycardia, subdural hemorrhage, and alcohol abuse. The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including blood cultures, urine culture, EEG, lumbar puncture, and MRI. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications and IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The presence of fever and ongoing investigations for blood and urine cultures suggest a possible infection in the patient. This could potentially lead to sepsis or septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of subdural hemorrhage indicates a risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the recent lumbar puncture and anticoagulant medications.
3. Neurological complications: The altered mental status and subdural hemorrhage may indicate a risk of neurological complications such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or further neurological deterioration.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation with respiratory failure suggests a risk of worsening respiratory function, which could be exacerbated by underlying lung conditions or complications from the ICU stay.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, delirium tremens, or other complications.

   # Tachypnea: with tachycardia. Concerning for PE, but chest CTA
   negative for PE on prelim read. No clear evidence of pneumonia. Might
   be an acute primary CNS process. Stable O2 sat on 4L NC.
   - supplemental oxygen as needed

   .
   # Altered mental status: stable bleed, no obvious infection so far but
   LP has not been done. With fevers and leukocytosis. ?rigidity on exam,
   fevers, and altered mental status suggest neuroleptic malignant
   syndrome, but there is no apparent medication trigger. On citalopram,
   ?serotonin release syndrome, but no n/v/diarrhea. ?seizures or

","The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted for a head bleed. He now presents with altered mental status, fevers, and tachypnea. The patient has several potential medical complications based on the information provided.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is characterized by difficulty in breathing. This could be due to the head bleed causing increased intracranial pressure or other underlying lung conditions.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite being on antibiotics. This could indicate an ongoing infection, possibly in the central nervous system (meningoencephalitis) or another source.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be due to the head bleed, alcohol abuse, medication side effects, or another underlying condition. It is important to evaluate for potential causes such as infection, metabolic imbalances, or neurological issues.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an increased heart rate, which could be a response to the fever, altered mental status, or an indication of another underlying condition such as infection or heart dysfunction.

5. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient has a subdural hemorrhage, which is a collection of blood between the covering of the brain (dura) and the surface of the brain itself. This can occur due to head trauma and may contribute to the altered mental"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a history of SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage) and IPH (intraparenchymal hemorrhage). He is currently experiencing worsening altered mental status, tachypnea, and fevers. The patient has a background of EtOH (alcohol) abuse and remote history of lung cancer with resection. His last dose of antibiotics was on 03/29/2177 at 03:30 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient is experiencing rapid breathing, which may be due to respiratory distress or an acute primary CNS process. Oxygen supplementation is being provided, and the patient's O2 saturation is stable on 4L NC (nasal cannula).

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is lethargic but follows some commands. An EEG shows no seizure activity, and an MRI read is pending. Empiric vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir have been started for meningitis/encephalitis.

3. Fevers: The patient has been running fevers, and the etiology is unknown. No clear infection has been identified, but given the MS changes, there is concern for meningoencephalitis. Empiric antibiotics and further investigations are planned.

   # Altered mental status: stable bleed, no obvious infection so far but
   LP has not been done. With fevers and leukocytosis. ?rigidity on exam,
   fevers, and altered mental status suggest neuroleptic malignant
   syndrome, but there is no apparent medication trigger. On citalopram,
   ?serotonin release syndrome, but no n/v/diarrhea. ?seizures or

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). He is now admitted to the MICU with worsening altered mental status, tachypnea, and fevers. The patient's condition has been unstable, with changes in vital signs and laboratory values. He is currently on multiple medications including phenytoin, antibiotics (Vanc/ceft/azithro), and labetalol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing tachypnea and respiratory distress, which could be due to pneumonia, acute primary CNS process, or other underlying causes. Oxygen supplementation and respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which could be attributed to various factors such as infection (meningoencephalitis), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin release syndrome, seizures, withdrawal, or hyponatremia. Immediate evaluation through lumbar puncture (LP), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) is warranted to determine the cause.

3. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers with unknown etiology. It is important to consider potential infections, including meningoencephalitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old man admitted for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). He is now in the MICU with worsening altered mental status, tachypnea, and fevers. The patient was found intoxicated and lying outside by his daughter. He was taken to OSH, where a small right intraparenchymal hemorrhage and SAH were found. He was loaded with phenytoin and transferred to Hospital1. Neurosurgery did not operate, and his motor score (MS) has been stable. He is oriented to person and being in the hospital but not to date. He has had fevers for a few days and has sputum positive for gram-negative rods (GNRs). He is being treated with Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin for presumed pneumonia (PNA), although his chest X-ray is benign. He also has a sodium level of 128 on 2177-03-28. He has not required CIWA. He was transferred to medicine for further management. On the evening of 2177-03-28, the patient reportedly became tachypneic and unresponsive.

","The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse and remote history of lung cancer who was admitted for a head bleed. He is now presenting with altered mental status, fevers, and tachypnea. His condition has been worsening despite receiving antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals lethargy but follows some commands. He has a clear chest X-ray and a negative chest CT angiogram for pulmonary embolism. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits except for hyponatremia. 

The patient's assessment and plan include treating his tachypnea with supplemental oxygen, addressing his altered mental status with an MRI and EEG, and initiating empiric antibiotics for meningitis/encephalitis. The patient's fevers remain of unknown etiology, and he should undergo further evaluation including a lumbar puncture. His head bleed appears stable, and he will continue to receive levetiracetam and low-dose steroids. 

The patient's hyponatremia is unclear in origin, possibly secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) from head trauma. His hypertension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for worsening altered mental status, tachypnea, and fevers. He was found intoxicated and lying outside by his daughter, and at the emergency department, he was found to have a small right intraparenchymal hemorrhage and SAH. He was loaded with phenytoin and transferred to Hospital1, where neurosurgery did not operate. His mental status has been stable since then. He has been febrile with temperatures up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit and has sputum positive for gram-negative rods (GNRs). He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin for presumed pneumonia, although his chest X-ray was benign. He also had hyponatremia with a sodium level of 128 on 03/28/2177. He has not required CIWA (clonidine withdrawal scale). He was transferred to medicine for further management and on the evening of 03/28/2177, he became tachypneic and unresponsive. A head CT showed stable bleed; chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE) but showed likely aspirated material in the right bronchus. He was admitted to the MIC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient's temperature is currently 102.0°F and has been fluctuating throughout the day. His heart rate is 88 bpm, blood pressure is 150/70 mmHg, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient is receiving various medications including acyclovir, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, and labetalol. He underwent a lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the cause of his symptoms. The MRI preliminary read showed possible venous sinus thrombosis. The patient's blood cultures and urine culture results are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Venous sinus thrombosis: This is a potential complication indicated by the MRI findings. It refers to the formation of blood clots in the venous sinuses of the brain, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological symptoms.
2. Central nervous system (CNS) infection: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and negative HSV PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggest a possible CNS infection, such as viral or bacterial meningitis.
3. Drug-induced complications: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted for a head bleed and now presenting with altered mental status, fevers, and tachypnea. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there are concerns for possible pulmonary embolism, which has been ruled out on preliminary read of chest computed tomography angiography (CTA). No clear evidence of pneumonia is seen. The patient's altered mental status is improving, likely related to the recent head bleed and possible post-ictal state. Lumbar puncture was performed with concern for bacterial or viral meningitis, and empirical treatment has been initiated. The patient's fevers are of unknown etiology, and there is concern for meningoencephalitis, possibly neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Empirical antibiotic therapy has been continued. The patient's head bleed is being closely monitored, and medications have been adjusted accordingly. Hyponatremia has improved, likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) from head trauma. Fluid restriction is recommended when the patient is able to take oral intake, and medications are being administered in normal saline instead of dextrose. The patient's hypertension is chronic and will be managed with lisinopril. Chronic alcohol abuse is also noted, and appropriate interventions are being implemented. Other comorbidities include diabetes mellitus, depression, prostate cancer, and a history of subdural hemorrh"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for a head bleed. He is now presenting with altered mental status, fevers, and tachypnea. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.0°F (38.9°C), blood pressure ranging from 150/70 mmHg to 173/108 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and other ICU medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for low sodium levels. Imaging studies reveal a potential venous sinus thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by his rapid breathing and low oxygen saturation. This could be due to an underlying lung infection or other respiratory issues.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite being on antibiotics. This suggests a possible infection or another cause of fever that needs further investigation.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status continues to fluctuate, ranging from agitation to withdrawal. This may be attributed to various factors such as infection, alcohol withdrawal, or complications from the head bleed.

","The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted for a head bleed and now presenting with altered mental status, fevers, and tachypnea. He has several medical conditions including respiratory failure, subdural hemorrhage, alcohol abuse, hypertension, depression, prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 154/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolytes are within normal range except for hyponatremia, which has improved. His kidney function is mildly impaired with an elevated creatinine level. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is moving all extremities and answering questions with head movements, indicating some level of responsiveness. He has no jugular venous distention or murmurs on cardiovascular examination. His respiratory effort is rapid, with clear lungs to auscultation. His abdomen is soft and non-distended with no masses or guarding. 

The patient's current medications include levetiracetam, acyclovir, prednisone, lisinopril, folate, thiamine, vitamin B12, citalopram, bicalutamide, and a bowel regimen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, presenting with respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, tachycardia, subdural hemorrhage, and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. It is important to identify the source of the infection to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and prevent complications such as sepsis.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various causes, including the subdural hemorrhage, alcohol abuse, or other systemic complications. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status is essential to detect any changes in consciousness or cognitive function.

4. Subdural Hemorrhage: The presence of a subdural hemorrhage increases the risk of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation, which can compromise cerebral perfusion and potentially lead to brain herniation if not managed promptly.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be a response to fever, hypoxemia, or sepsis. Continuous monitoring of heart"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse admitted for a head bleed. He is currently experiencing altered mental status, fevers, and tachypnea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), blood pressure ranging from 154/82 to 163/82 mmHg, heart rate of 97 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal glucose levels. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormal findings in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or gastrointestinal systems. 

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with rapid breathing. This may be due to an underlying infection or other causes such as aspiration pneumonia or complications from alcohol abuse.
2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been having persistent fevers, which could be due to an infection, ETOH withdrawal, or another cause. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be a result of the head bleed, infection, or ETOH withdrawal. Immediate"
