","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain and was found to have an anterior STEMI due to an occluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She underwent stenting of the LAD and is currently in cardiogenic shock, requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/55 to 119/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm.

Her lab results show a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, sodium of 138 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels ranging from 7.29 to 7.95 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count decreasing from 192 K/uL on admission to 114 K/uL in 1.5 days, likely due to mechanical destruction and not HIT. She also has elevated liver enzymes, which are expected due to cardiogenic shock. 

The patient is being monitored closely, and her treatment plan"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse, who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a STEMI in the occluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She underwent stenting of the LAD and is currently in the ICU due to cardiogenic shock.

The patient has been on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to support her heart function. The goal for the PA diastolic pressure is between 15-20 mmHg, and the cardiac index should be within normal limits. Initially, the patient was on a 1:1 ratio but had to be changed to 1:2 due to a drop in SvO2 and MAP, but then restarted on 1:1 with improved PAD. The IABP waveforms are consistent with good timing.

The patient's platelet count has decreased from 190 on admission to 114 in 1.5 days, which is likely due to mechanical destruction and not HIT. She is being monitored for thrombocytopenia.

The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm (NSR) on telemetry monitoring. She has been counseled about smoking cessation due to tobacco abuse. She is also being treated for hyperlipidemia with a statin.

There is evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, as indicated by elevated liver function tests (LFTs) due to cardiogenic shock."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) due to an occluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient underwent stenting of the LAD and is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock, indicated by a cardiac index initially 1.3.

The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac index initially 1.3 suggests cardiogenic shock, which requires continued intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The goal PA diastolic pressure should be between 15-20 mmHg, and the goal cardiac index is mentioned as 1-1 (although the value is not specified). The patient has been tried on 1:2 IABP with a drop in SVO2 and MAP, so they have been restarted on 1:1 IABP and will try again today given improved PAD. Good timing of pump waveforms will be monitored, and heparin will be continued while on IABP.

2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and presented with chest pain due to an occluded LAD artery, resulting in a STEMI. The patient underwent stenting of the LAD artery.

3. Electrocardiogram (EKG)"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
   are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the anterior wall, anterior
   septum and apex and mild hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall. Overall
   left ventricular systolic function is mild to moderately depressed
   (LVEF= 40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV
   diastolic dysfunction. The remaining left ventricular segments contract
   normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular dysfunction c/w
   coronary artery disease (LAD territory). Moderate diastolic dysfunction
   with elevated filling pressures.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is stable with no significant changes in vital signs. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic. The transesophageal echo revealed mild to moderate regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease, specifically in the LAD territory. There is also moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's cardiac function, development of heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias, or further deterioration of the left ventricular systolic function. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and cardiac function is essential to promptly address any potential complications."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, which is a serious condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped from 190 on admission to 114 in 1.5 days. This could be due to mechanical destruction of platelets, as the presentation is too early for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Monitoring the platelet count and considering interventions to prevent bleeding complications is important.

3. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient has moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures, as indicated by tissue Doppler imaging and transmitral Doppler. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.

4. Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction: The patient has mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, particularly in the anterior wall, anterior septum, and apex. This can result in reduced pumping ability of the heart and contribute to heart failure symptoms.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient presented with chest pain and was found to have a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) in the LAD territory. This suggests underlying coronary artery disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of heavy smoking who presented with chest pain and was found to have a STEMI due to an occluded left anterior descending artery. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the LAD. The patient initially developed cardiogenic shock, which required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The IABP was removed yesterday after showing no more dependence. The patient is now stable without mechanical support. She is currently on multiple medications including Coumadin, aspirin, statin, Plavix, captopril, beta-blocker, spironolactone, and other medications for pain management, nausea, and constipation. 

Potential Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient had an initial episode of cardiogenic shock due to a large anterior infarct. Although the IABP was removed and the patient is currently stable, there is still a risk of recurrent cardiogenic shock if there are further complications or worsening of the myocardial function.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, but stable. It is likely related to the IABP insertion. Monitoring of platelet count is important to detect any significant decrease that may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Chest Pain: The patient experienced chest pain at night while eating, which could be due to esophageal spasm, inflammation,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse who presented with chest pain and was found to have a STEMI. The patient underwent stenting of the occluded left anterior descending artery (LAD) and experienced a large anterior infarct.

The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, indicated by a cardiac index of 1.3, and required intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) support. However, the patient has since improved and is now doing well without mechanical support. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remain stable.

The patient also had low blood pressures overnight, which resolved with the administration of 250cc boluses of normal saline (NS) three times. This was likely due to overdiuresis. The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin (ASA), statin at a dose of 80 mg, Plavix, lisinopril, and beta-blockers (BB).

The patient is also being treated for congestive heart failure (CHF) with the addition of furosemide (Lasix) 20 mg orally daily due to fluid overload. The patient's chest pain has resolved, and her rhythm remains normal sinus rhythm (NSR) on telemetry monitoring.

The patient has been counseled about smoking cessation by a social worker (SW) due to tobacco abuse. Her platelet count remains stable, and she is being continued on a stat"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) due to an occluded left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient underwent stenting of the LAD and experienced cardiogenic shock, which required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The IABP and swan were removed after the patient showed no dependence on them.

The patient is currently stable without mechanical support, with stable blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). The medical team has started Coumadin for low flow in the area of akinetic/hypokinetic apex, and continues to administer ASA, statin 80 mg, Plavix, and lisinopril. A beta-blocker has been added, and spironolactone is being held off for now. Daily EKGs are being performed.

The patient is also being treated for congestive heart failure (CHF), with low-dose Lasix given and fluid balance monitored closely. The patient's chest pain is similar in quality to prior episodes but occurs during oral intake, and differential diagnoses include esophageal spasm, inflammatory, or ACS. The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm (NSR), and telemetry monitoring is ongoing.

The patient has been counseled about smoking cessation by a social worker regarding tobacco abuse"
