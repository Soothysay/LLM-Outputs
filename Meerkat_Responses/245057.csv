   Fluid analysis / Other labs: Echo: The left atrium is dilated. There is
   moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   No vegetations seen (cannot definitively exclude).
   Imaging: There is interval significant increase in left lower lobe
   consolidation which
   appears to be progressing since [**2183-8-3**] and highly suspicious
   for developing left lower lobe pneumonia. The right middle lobe opacity
   is unchanged and may represent a focus of infection and/or atelectasis.
   The upper lungs are unremarkable. There is no evidence of failure.
   Small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
   Microbiology: -lab error no positive BCx
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 52 yo male with h/o Hep C cirrhosis, ETOH abuse who presented with
   coffee ground emesis and MS changes.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER/ANEMIA-pt presented with history of
   hematemasis and drop in hemocrit. However, etiology remains unclear
   especially with EGD yesterday that did not find upper GI source. Pt
   also has h/o diverticulosis but no BRBPR.   Overnight had a drop in Hct
   from 28.6-26.4. [**Month (only) 60**] be alternative source in setting of pancreatitis
   and fall in ED.
   -also required platlets to keep >50
   -Protonix IV BID per GI recs
   -start diet of clear and advance if tolerate, observe for aspiration
   and consult speech and swallow if suspected
   -q6 HCT and Platelet check; will transfuse for Hct <25, Platelets <50K
   -repeat CT abdomen with and without to find hematoma vs abscess
 FEVER-Pt still spiking fevers, likely due to pna that has progressed
   -continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc and Zosyn for picture c/w
   aspiration
   -TTE from yesterday-no vegetations, LVEF75%
   -CXR-as above shows progression of pneumonia in L base, will repeat
   CXR
   -f/u Urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures-try to get induced sputum today
   -continue surveillence cultures
   -records from [**Hospital1 1817**] show history of pancreatitis on discharge days
   before admission here
 AMS-Pt came in with disorientation and garbled speech considered to
   be from withdrawal vs acute intoxication now improving
   -per [**Hospital1 1817**] records was discharged with Benzos and narcotics likely
   accounting for AMS since he has not received any here and has cleared
   -may have contributed to aspriation
   -IF MS does not improve will consider lactulose
   -fall precautions
 PANCYTOPENIA-pt w history of chronic thrombocytopenia, now with
   infection but no spike in WBC
   -confusing picture but may need to see heme as outpatient
 ODYNOPHAGIA-patient came in w dry mucous memranes and poor oral
   hygiene, DDx inlcudes phayngitis vs GERD vs poor oral hygiene
   - improved mouth care, humidified air seems
   -consider CT and then possibly ENT consult
   -no pain meds for now as patient has a history of abuse
 ETOH [**Name (NI) 3985**] Pt recently admitted for detox and currently denies ETOh
   use over past few weeks; however given strong h/o abuse will cover for
   possible withdrawal.
   -D/C CIWA scale
   -MVI, thiamine and folate
   -Restraints or 1:1 sitter if needed
   -Ativan prn
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE-LFT abnl- Pt with mildly elevated amylase and
   lipase; has recent h/o pancreatitis. Also wtih elevated AST thought not
   surprising given ETOH abuse h/o but all elevated levels of liver
   function trending down.
   -Monitor for now
 CONJUNCTIVITIS-pt had R eye red and purulent at admission, now
   resolved with erythromycin opthal solution
   -willl follow
 HEPATITIS C- Followed by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 3827**]; recently completed course of
   Ribavarin in IFN. Pt does not appear encephalopathic any more.
   -reportedly had cirrhosis, but does not look like it with HSM and no
   varices
   -Consider Lactulose if MS does not improve
HTN- Hold home anti-HTNs for now given acute bleeding risk

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, who presented with coffee ground emesis and mental status changes. He has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, pancreatitis, acute hepatitis, conjunctivitis, and possible aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2Â°F, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 123/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is on mechanical ventilation support.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 52 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 17/43), elevated blood glucose level of 107 mg/dL, and normal kidney function with creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL.

An echocardiogram reveals left atrial dilation, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function (EF>75%), normal right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion, structurally normal aortic valve with trace aortic regurgitation, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets with trivial mitral regurgitation, borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no pericardial effusion.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and alcohol abuse. The patient presented with coffee ground emesis and mental status changes. He was found to have gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, pancreatitis, acute hepatitis, and conjunctivitis. The patient also has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia and is currently experiencing pancytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient presented with coffee ground emesis and a drop in hemoglobin levels. This indicates possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The cause remains unclear, and further investigations are needed to identify the source of bleeding.

2. Pneumonia and parapneumonic effusions: The patient's worsening left and right pneumonia and the presence of parapneumonic effusions suggest a respiratory infection. The fever spikes could be due to pneumonia progression. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but close monitoring and repeat chest X-rays are necessary to assess the response.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, and his amylase and lipase levels are elevated. Although the liver function tests are abnormal, they are trending down. Monitoring the patient for any worsening symptoms of pancreatitis is essential.

4. Hepatitis C: The patient has a known history of Hepatitis C. His recent treatment with Ribavirin and interferon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall and 81 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and low blood counts (pancytopenia). The patient has been experiencing fever and has shown signs of acute pancreatitis. He is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and nutritional support. The patient's vital signs indicate a high temperature, elevated heart rate, and slightly low blood pressure. His oxygen saturation is at 91% and he requires respiratory support. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 490 mL. Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there is an indication of pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms, elevated amylase and lipase levels, and imaging results indicate acute pancreatitis.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood counts may lead to an increased risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient's slightly low blood pressure may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level of 91% suggests possible respiratory compromise.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He has been receiving antibiotics and IV fluids, but continues to show signs of infection and organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.8Â°F, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 142/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. He is not receiving respiratory support. The patient's blood cultures were taken on 08/07/2183 at 04:13 AM and his urine culture was taken on 08/07/2183 at 04:48 AM. The patient has been diagnosed with pancytopenia and acute pancreatitis. He is being monitored closely in the ICU, receiving appropriate care and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in several organ functions, including low platelet count (pancytopenia), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal kidney function (creatinine).
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation and history of respiratory distress may indicate the development of ARDS, which requires close"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 52 yo male with h/o Hep C cirrhosis, ETOH abuse who presented with
   coffee ground emesis and MS changes.
 ASPIRATION PNEUMONIAFEVER-Pt still spiking fevers, likely due to pna
   that has progressed
   -change Abx to Levoquin picture c/w aspiration, irritation of diaphragm
   likely causing hiccups
   -TTE from yesterday-no vegetations, LVEF75%
   -CXR-as above shows progression of pneumonia in L base, will repeat
   CXR
   -CT abd show progression of B/L pneumonia
   -f/u Urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures-try to get induced sputum today
   -continue surveillence cultures
   -records from [**Hospital1 1817**] show history of pancreatitis on discharge days
   before admission here
 ABDOMINAL PAIN-pt has h/o of pancreatitis with amylase/lipase
   trending down
   -will continue to monitor
   -no RUQ pain as CT Abd might suggest
   -mild diffuse tenderness on deep palpation
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER/ANEMIA-pt presented with history of
   hematemasis and drop in hemocrit. However, etiology remains unclear
   especially with EGD yesterday that did not find upper GI source except
   esophagitis. Pt also has h/o diverticulosis but no BRBPR.   Overnight
   had a drop in Hct from 28.6-27.1.
   -still with slow trend down in Hct, could be related to pancytopenia
   -also required platlets to keep >50
   -Protonix IV BID per GI recs
   -start diet of clear and advance if tolerate, observe for aspiration
   and consult speech and swallow if suspected
   -q6 HCT and Platelet check; will transfuse for Hct <25, Platelets <50K
   -repeat CT abdomen notc/w hematoma as source
 AMS-Pt came in with disorientation and garbled speech considered to
   be from withdrawal vs acute intoxication now improving
   -per [**Hospital1 1817**] records was discharged with Benzos and narcotics likely
   accounting for AMS since he has not received any here and has cleared
   -may have contributed to aspriation
   -IF MS does not improve will consider lactulose
   -fall precautions
 PANCYTOPENIA-pt w history of chronic thrombocytopenia, now with
   infection but no spike in WBC, and anemia
   -confusing picture but may need to see heme as outpatient
   -could be related to ribavarin treatment in past
 ODYNOPHAGIA-patient came in w dry mucous memranes and poor oral
   hygiene, DDx inlcudes phayngitis vs GERD vs poor oral hygiene
   - improved mouth care, humidified air seems
   -can be attributed to esophagitis, improved on PPI
   -no pain meds for now as patient has a history of abuse
 ETOH [**Name (NI) 3985**] Pt recently admitted for detox and currently denies ETOh
   use over past few weeks; however given strong h/o abuse will cover for
   possible withdrawal.
   -D/C CIWA scale
   -MVI, thiamine and folate
   -Restraints or 1:1 sitter if needed
   -Ativan prn
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE-LFT abnl- Pt with mildly elevated amylase and
   lipase; has recent h/o pancreatitis. Also wtih elevated AST thought not
   surprising given ETOH abuse h/o but all elevated levels of liver
   function trending down.
   -Monitor for now
 CONJUNCTIVITIS-pt had R eye red and purulent at admission, now
   resolved with erythromycin opthal solution
   -willl follow
 HEPATITIS C- Followed by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 3827**]; recently completed course of
   Ribavarin in IFN. Pt does not appear encephalopathic any more.
   -reportedly had cirrhosis, but does not look like it with HSM and no
   varices
   -Consider Lactulose if MS does not improve
HTN- Hold home anti-HTNs for now given acute bleeding risk

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and alcohol abuse. He presented with coffee ground emesis and mental status changes. The patient has been experiencing fever, hiccups, worsening left-sided pneumonia with new foci of infection on the right lung base, bilateral parapneumonic effusions, and gallbladder wall edema with pericholecystic fluid suggestive of cholecystitis. The patient has a history of pancreatitis and elevated amylase/lipase levels, which are now trending down. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and previous hospitalization for detox from alcohol. The patient has pancytopenia with low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. He also has odynophagia, conjunctivitis, and a history of Hepatitis C, for which he has completed treatment with Ribavirin and IFN. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and aspiration, proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcers, and anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the regular floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's hiccups and dry cough with deep inspiration suggest potential aspiration, which could lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient"

   and he clinically looks better.  We are not covering atypicals so will
   start Levoquinb and d/c Zosyn.  CT is somewhat concenring for
   developing cholecystitis and his amylase remains elevated. Need to
