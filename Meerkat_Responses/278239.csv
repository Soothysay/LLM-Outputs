   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 6267**] is a 53 year old female with a PMH significant for HIV
   (CD4 34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Broad differential at this time given patient's
   immunocomprised state including opportunistic infections such as MAC or
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] or bacterial pneumonia, MTB, or non-infectious etiologies
   including PE. ABG overnight atypical in setting of chronic metabolic
   alkalosis, although patient has been hypoxic off supplemental O2.   CHF
   unlikely given recent TTE with preserved LVEF and BNP on admission
   <500. Patient at baseline also has documented hypoxia with R -> L
   intracardiac shunt, pulmonary hypertension (53/30, wedge 14, no
   response to vasoactive trial) on home supplemental O2, and
   bronchiectasis all contributing to decreased cardiopulmonary reserve.
   - Continue empiric coverage for PCP with TMP/SMX and prednisone,
   - Continue empiric coverage for bacterial pneumonia with vanco,
   levofloxacin, and pip/tazo.
   - F/u sputum and blood culture data
   - Check induced sputum
   - Standing nebs
   - Hold lasix as patient does not appear volume overloaded
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Repeat TTE with bubble study
   - Legionella urinary antigen
   - ID consult.
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: Most recent CD4 count 33 on [**2133-1-6**], [**Date Range **] load
   undetectable.
   - HAART held overnight, will check with ID this AM.
   - cont azithromycin ppx
   - cont diflucan ppx
   - ID consult
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 20.7 down from 23.2 on admission.  Baseline hct
   mid-upper 20s. Previously felt to be secondary to bone marrow
   supression from HIB with component of hemolysis. Hemolysis labs
   overnight negative with normal haptoglobin.
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBC, crossmatch for 2 units.
   - Check hct Q12H
   - Guaiac stools, if positive, will consult GI for further diagnostic
   and possible therapeutic intervention.

   myelosuppression and sequestration [**3-3**] splenomegaly.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of HIV (CD4 count of 34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia. She has several medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's immunocompromised state makes her susceptible to various opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), or non-infectious etiologies like pulmonary embolism (PE). The ABG results show atypical values in the context of chronic metabolic alkalosis.

2. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 23.2 on admission to 20.7 this morning. It was previously believed to be secondary to bone marrow suppression from HIV with a component of hemolysis. However, overnight lab results indicate negative hemolysis with normal haptoglobin levels.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low (62), likely due to HIV-related myelosuppression and sequestration secondary to splenomegaly.

4. Hepatitis C: The patient has active hepatitis C infection with a high viral load of 8,640,000 IU/mL. However, treatment is being withheld due to pancytopenia.

The patient is currently on empiric coverage for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 6267] is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history significant for HIV (CD4 34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia. She has a baseline documented hypoxia with right-to-left intracardiac shunt, pulmonary hypertension, and bronchiectasis contributing to decreased cardiopulmonary reserve. On admission, she was found to have anemia with Hct 23.2, thrombocytopenia with Plt 62, and active hepatitis C with a viral load of 8,640,000 IU/mL.

The patient was started on invasive ventilation and received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for a critical hemoglobin level of 23.5. Her HAART was restarted, and she was continued on TMP/SMX for presumed PCP, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for bacterial pneumonia coverage. Beta glucan and galactomannan tests are pending, as well as sputum and blood culture results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's dyspnea and hypoxia indicate a possible respiratory infection such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. Given her immunocompromised state, opportunistic infections like MAC or PCP should also be considered. The chest X-ray and CT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a medical history of HIV (CD4 count of 34) who was admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient has a broad differential diagnosis for her dyspnea and hypoxia, including opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), or non-infectious etiologies such as pulmonary embolism (PE), hemorrhage, or congestive heart failure (CHF). The presence of extrinsic restriction due to previous burns and a history of bronchiectasis further contribute to decreased cardiopulmonary reserve.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an unclear etiology of metabolic alkalosis, which may be contributing to her condition. Possible causes could be hypoventilation, repletion of chloride, or consideration of hydrochloric acid administration.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 19.1 g/dL on admission. Previously, it was thought to be secondary to bone marrow suppression from HIV with a component of hemolysis. However, overnight labs showed negative hemolysis with normal haptoglobin levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 6267**] is a 53 year old female with a PMH significant for HIV
   (CD4 34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Broad differential at this time given patient's
   immunocomprised state including opportunistic infections such as MAC or
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] or bacterial pneumonia, MTB, or non-infectious etiologies
   including PE. ABG overnight atypical in setting of chronic metabolic
   alkalosis, although patient has been hypoxic off supplemental O2.   CHF
   unlikely given recent TTE with preserved LVEF and BNP on admission
   <500. Patient at baseline also has documented hypoxia with R -> L
   intracardiac shunt, pulmonary hypertension (53/30, wedge 14, no
   response to vasoactive trial) on home supplemental O2, and
   bronchiectasis all contributing to decreased cardiopulmonary reserve.
   Echo [**6-9**] demonstrated preserved EF, mod pulm HTN, and transpulmonic
   passage.  Sputum negative for PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**6-9**] for respiratory
   distress, increased work of breathing.
   - CT chest
   - Beta glucan and galactomannan pending
   - Continue empiric coverage for PCP with TMP/SMX and prednisone
   - Continue empiric coverage for bacterial pneumonia with vanco,
   levofloxacin, and pip/tazo.
   - F/u sputum and blood culture data
   - Check induced sputum

   # Anemia: Hct 23.2 on admission. . Previously felt to be secondary to
   bone marrow supression from HIB with component of hemolysis. Hemolysis
   labs overnight negative with normal haptoglobin. Transfused [**6-9**] for
   crit 21 with appropriate response, however crit 19.1 this am.
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBC, crossmatch for 2 units.
   - Check hct Q12H
   - Guaiac stools

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of HIV and is currently admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Opportunistic infections: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV, there is a broad differential for the cause of dyspnea and hypoxia. Opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), or non-infectious etiologies including pulmonary embolism (PE) should be considered.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an atypical ABG result indicating metabolic alkalosis. The etiology of this condition is unclear and requires further investigation.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level on admission was 23.2, which was previously thought to be secondary to bone marrow suppression from HIV with a component of hemolysis. However, overnight hemolysis labs were negative with normal haptoglobin. The patient received a blood transfusion for a critical hemoglobin level of 21, but their current Hct level is 19.1. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration for further transfusion may be necessary.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's baseline platelet count is 62, and it has decreased further to 42 today. This"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with suspected tuberculosis. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. On admission, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic, requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Initial laboratory results showed acute kidney injury, anemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. The patient's condition has remained unstable with ongoing hypotension and oliguria. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's initial laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, which can lead to further deterioration of renal function if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate poor perfusion and can contribute to organ dysfunction, including renal impairment and potential cardiac complications.
3. Oliguria: The patient's low urine output suggests inadequate renal perfusion and can be an indication of worsening kidney function or volume overload.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for invasive ventilation indicates respiratory failure, which can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and other respiratory complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels (hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia"

   Studies:
   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. After intravenous injection of
   agitated saline both at rest and with cough, microbubbles are seen in
   the left atrium 5-7 beats after full opacification of the right heart.
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Late appearance of saline contrast suggestive of
   transpulmonic passage (e.g., pulmonary AVM). Normal biventricular
   cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
   function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  If the
   clinical suspicion for an atrial septal defect is high, a TEE is
   suggested to better clarify the interatrial septum.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a medical history of AIDS (CD4 count 34) admitted for dyspnea and hypoxia. She is intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has bronchospasm with clear secretions, minimal mucosal friability, and negative gram stain on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The BAL also shows no cells. The patient has a broad differential diagnosis including atypical or opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), viral infection, or bacterial pneumonia. Non-infectious causes like pulmonary embolism (PE) are less likely given the bilateral peri-hilar infiltrates. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) has been ruled out. Intersitial pneumonitis, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) or bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), is a possibility. The patient has poor cardiopulmonary reserve due to known bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, and right-to-left shunt. The patient is only agreeable to short-term intubation. 

The patient's acid-base status shows a metabolic alkalosis of unclear etiology, now with respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission, with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of AIDS admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia. She is currently intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a CD4 count of 34 and is on HAART. Her current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, midazolam, fentanyl, and steroids for PCP treatment. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 49,000/mm³. The patient's HIV/AIDS status is noted, along with her hepatitis C infection. The patient has a history of bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, and a right-to-left shunt. The impression is respiratory failure possibly due to PCP pneumonia, although other causes such as PE, DAH, intersitial pneumonitis, or LIP/BOOP are also considered. The patient has agreed to short-term intubation only. 

Potential Medical Complications:

   Studies:
   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. After intravenous injection of
   agitated saline both at rest and with cough, microbubbles are seen in
   the left atrium 5-7 beats after full opacification of the right heart.
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Late appearance of saline contrast suggestive of
   transpulmonic passage (e.g., pulmonary AVM). Normal biventricular
   cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
   function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  If the
   clinical suspicion for an atrial septal defect is high, a TEE is
   suggested to better clarify the interatrial septum.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been intubated. They have expressed wishes for DNI (Do Not Intubate) and short-term intubation, with consideration of changing to comfort measures only (CMO) if no progress is made in several days. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range, heart rate slightly elevated but within acceptable limits, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support system, using an endotracheal tube, and receiving a combination of midazolam and fentanyl for sedation and pain management.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, calcium, and magnesium. However, the white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 13.6 K/uL, and the platelet count is slightly low at 49. Other lab results, including liver function tests and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal a mildly dilated left atrium and ascending aorta, with normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function. The aortic and mitral valves appear structurally normal. There is evidence of moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and no pericardial effusion.

   Studies:
   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. After intravenous injection of
   agitated saline both at rest and with cough, microbubbles are seen in
   the left atrium 5-7 beats after full opacification of the right heart.
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Late appearance of saline contrast suggestive of
   transpulmonic passage (e.g., pulmonary AVM). Normal biventricular
   cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
   function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  If the
   clinical suspicion for an atrial septal defect is high, a TEE is
   suggested to better clarify the interatrial septum.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6267**] is a 53 year old female with a PMH significant for AIDS
   (CD4 34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia now intubated for
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Bronch yesterday with clear secretions with
   minimal muscosal friability. BAL gram stain negative with complete
   culture and serology/PCR results pending.  Continues to have broad
   differential including atypical/OI pulmonary infection including PCP or
   MAC, viral, or more common pathogen bacterial pneumonia.
   Non-infectious etiologies include PE although less likely given
   evolving bilateral peri-hilar infiltrates.  DAH ruled out given bronch
   yesterday with minimal hemorrhage. Intersitial pneumonitis is a
   possibility, especially given AIDS, including LIP or BOOP.  Patient at
   baseline has poor cardiopulmonary reserve given known bronchiectasis,
   pulmonary hypertension, and R->L shunt. Per discussion with HCP,
   patient would only be agreeable to short-term intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of AIDS (CD4 count 34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia. She is intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a broad differential including atypical/OI pulmonary infection, viral, or more common pathogen bacterial pneumonia. Non-infectious etiologies such as PE are less likely. The patient also has known bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, and R -> L shunt. The patient's baseline cardiopulmonary reserve is poor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if the underlying cause, such as an atypical/OI pulmonary infection, is not effectively treated. This can lead to further deterioration of the patient's lung function and potentially result in death.
2. Infectious etiologies: The patient is at risk for various infectious complications due to her immunocompromised status (AIDS). These may include PCP, MAC, viral infections, or bacterial pneumonia. If these infections are not properly managed, they can worsen the patient's respiratory status and lead to sepsis or multi-organ failure.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has a known history of pulmonary hypertension, which increases the risk of right ventricular strain and potential heart failure in the setting of respiratory failure.
4. Bronchiectasis: The patient's known bronchiectasis increases the risk of recurrent respiratory infections"

   viral, or more common pathogen bacterial pneumonia. PCP ruled out and
   patient transitioned back to prophylaxis PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 6260**]. Non-infectious
   etiologies include PE although less likely given evolving bilateral
   peri-hilar infiltrates.  DAH ruled out given bronch yesterday with
   minimal hemorrhage. Intersitial pneumonitis is a possibility,
   especially given AIDS, including LIP or BOOP.  Patient at baseline has
   poor cardiopulmonary reserve given known bronchiectasis, pulmonary
   hypertension, and R->L shunt. Per discussion with HCP, patient would
   only be agreeable to short-term intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of AIDS (CD4 count 34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia. She is now intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a past medical history significant for bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, and a right-to-left shunt. She is currently on broad-spectrum antimicrobials and mechanical ventilation at ARDS settings. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, acid-base imbalance, anemia, HIV/AIDS, thrombocytopenia, and hepatitis C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings may be necessary.
2. Infectious Complications: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of perihilar infiltrates on the CT chest, there is a possibility of atypical or opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), viral pneumonia, or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be considered.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension may worsen during mechanical ventilation, leading to increased right ventricular afterload and potential right heart strain. Close monitoring of pulmonary pressures and cardiac function is essential.
4. Bleeding Disorders: The patient has received blood transfusions, which can lead"

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of arterial line start. The patient has perihilar infiltrates and apical parenchymal disease on CT chest. The patient's blood pressure has been trending down, and sedation has been decreased with a good response to a 500 cc IVF bolus. The patient received an additional 500 cc MIVF overnight. TMP/SMX was switched to prophylactic dosing and corticosteroids were held. Repeat rapid viral screen without cells was performed. TF (likely referring to thrombophilia) was started. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) was 24.5 and 20.8 on different occasions. Urine sodium levels were 22. MTB precautions were considered. The patient received various doses of antibiotics including levofloxacin, piperacillin, bactrim, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Infusions of midazolam and other ICU medications were administered. The patient's review of systems remained unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6267**] is a 53 year old male with a PMH significant for AIDS (CD4
   34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia now intubated for respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Bronch [**6-10**] with clear secretions with minimal
   muscosal friability. BAL and induced sputum cultures with 1+ GNRs.
   Continues to have broad differential including atypical/OI pulmonary
   infection including MAC, viral, or more common pathogen bacterial
   pneumonia. PCP ruled out and patient transitioned back to prophylaxis
   PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 6260**]. CT chest demonstrated no PE.  DAH ruled out given bronch
   with minimal hemorrhage. Intersitial pneumonitis is a possibility,
   especially given AIDS, including LIP or BOOP.  MTB unlikely given
   negative AFB on bronch.  Patient at baseline has poor cardiopulmonary
   reserve given known bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, and R->L
   shunt. Per discussion with HCP, patient would only be agreeable to
   short-term intubation.
   - Continue pip/tazo and levofloxacin for GNR double coverage.
   - Discontinue vanco
   - Follow-up culture and other infectious data including beta glucan,
   galactomannan, EBV, and CMV.
   - Standing MDIs
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation at ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**] settings
   - Follow-up ID recs
   .
   # Acid-base: Patient at baseline likely has chrnic respiratory acidosis
   with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. Most recent gas 7.41/69/89.
   .
   # Anemia: Patient received 1 unit PRBC yesterday for hct 20.8 (3 total
   for LOS). Hemolysis labs negative.
   - Check Q12H hct, transfuse for hct<21
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active T+S
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: Most recent CD4 count 33 on [**2133-1-6**], viral load
   undetectable. HAART restarted [**6-9**].
   - Continue HAART
   - Cont azithromycin ppx
   - Cont bactrim ppx
   - Cont diflucan ppx
   - F/u ID recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 60-100. Plt this AM 42. Felt to be secondary to
   HIV myelosuppression and sequestration [**3-3**] splenomegaly.  DIC labs
   negative.
   - Trend plt
   - Transfuse plt for plt < 10 or active bleeding
   .
   # Hepatitis C: Active disease with most recent VL 8,640,000 IU/mL on
   [**2132-3-4**]. Not being treated [**3-3**] pancytopenia. AFP and imaging negative
   [**2-8**].

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of AIDS and respiratory failure. He was intubated for dyspnea and hypoxia and has since self-extubated. The patient has a pseudomonas infection in his BAL and sputum cultures. His vital signs are stable, but he has an increased heart rate and low blood pressure. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation at ARDS settings and has been started on piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin for gram-negative bacterial coverage. His HIV/AIDS status is being managed with HAART, azithromycin prophylaxis, bactrim prophylaxis, and diflucan prophylaxis. The patient's thrombocytopenia is believed to be secondary to HIV myelosuppression and sequestration splenomegaly. His hepatitis C infection is active with a very high viral load, but treatment is not currently being pursued due to pancytopenia. The patient's code status is full code, and a family meeting has been scheduled for today.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Nosocomial infection or healthcare-associated infection due to prolonged ICU stay.
3. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy or hepatic failure due to active hepatitis C infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6267**] is a 53 year old male with a PMH significant for AIDS (CD4
   34) admitted with dyspnea and hypoxia now intubated for respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Bronch [**6-10**] with clear secretions with minimal
   muscosal friability. BAL and induced sputum cultures with 1+ GNRs.
   Continues to have broad differential including atypical/OI pulmonary
   infection including MAC, viral, or more common pathogen bacterial
   pneumonia. PCP ruled out and patient transitioned back to prophylaxis
   PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 6260**]. CT chest demonstrated no PE.  DAH ruled out given bronch
   with minimal hemorrhage. Intersitial pneumonitis is a possibility,
   especially given AIDS, including LIP or BOOP.  MTB unlikely given
   negative AFB on bronch.  Patient at baseline has poor cardiopulmonary
   reserve given known bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, and R->L
   shunt. Per discussion with HCP, patient would only be agreeable to
   short-term intubation.
   - Continue pip/tazo and levofloxacin for GNR double coverage.
   - Discontinue vanco
   - Follow-up culture and other infectious data including beta glucan,
   galactomannan, EBV, and CMV.
   - Standing MDIs
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation at ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**] settings
   - Follow-up ID recs
   .
   # Acid-base: Patient at baseline likely has chrnic respiratory acidosis
   with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. Most recent gas 7.41/69/89.
   .
   # Anemia: Patient received 1 unit PRBC yesterday for hct 20.8 (3 total
   for LOS). Hemolysis labs negative.
   - Check Q12H hct, transfuse for hct<21
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active T+S
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: Most recent CD4 count 33 on [**2133-1-6**], viral load
   undetectable. HAART restarted [**6-9**].
   - Continue HAART
   - Cont azithromycin ppx
   - Cont bactrim ppx
   - Cont diflucan ppx
   - F/u ID recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 60-100. Plt this AM 42. Felt to be secondary to
   HIV myelosuppression and sequestration [**3-3**] splenomegaly.  DIC labs
   negative.
   - Trend plt
   - Transfuse plt for plt < 10 or active bleeding
   .
   # Hepatitis C: Active disease with most recent VL 8,640,000 IU/mL on
   [**2132-3-4**]. Not being treated [**3-3**] pancytopenia. AFP and imaging negative
   [**2-8**].
   - Limit acetaminophen to 2g/day
   - Trend LFTs
