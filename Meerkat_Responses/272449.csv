","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple recent admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. She presents with altered mental status, and there is no clear infectious trigger or medication non-compliance identified. The abdominal ultrasound (US) shows reversal of flow within the left portal vein, no color flow detected in the main portal vein or right portal vein, although slow flow within these vessels cannot be entirely excluded. Normal resistive indices within the hepatic arteries are noted, and the hepatic veins are patent. Large volume ascites is also observed. The patient has been intubated and sedated, opens her eyes to loud voice, and appears comfortable. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 125/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. She has a white blood cell count of 15.5 x 10^3/mm^3, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, platelet count of 86 x 10^3/mm^3, and other abnormal lab values. The patient's condition is concerning for acute-on-chronic liver failure, and she requires further evaluation"

 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   A 54 yo woman with a history of ESLD and multiple recent admissions to
   OSH for hepatic encephalopathy presents with altered mental status.
   .
   # altered mental status:  Most likely secondary to hepatic encephalothy
   given that her son finds the progression similar to previous episodes,
   her ammonia level is elevated, and her recent course indicates frequent
   decompensations.  Benzodiazepene toxicity is also on the differential,
   although her son says her dose has not changed recently.  Regarding the
   cause of likely hepatic encephalopathy, no evidence of SBP including no
   abdominal pain or fevers.  No tap-able pocket visualized in the ED.
   Other infections are also possible triggers.  Blood and urine cx
   pending, CXR without obvious infiltrate.  Med noncomplaince seems less
   likely given family's good history of lactulose administration, but
   this regimen may simply be inadequate given her current level of
   cirrhosis.  Also possible would be acute on chronic hepatic
   insufficiency, e.g. secondary to portal vein thrombosis, although LFTs
   not markedly different from previous values in our system.
   - increase lactulse to 30 mg q2h until mental status begins to clear
   - consider rifaxamin (will d/w liver tomorrow)
   - continue ceftriaxone 1 g q24h for empiric treatment of SBP
   - US with doppler to confirm patency of vasculature
   - will ask US to evaluate if tap-pable site for diagnostic paracentesis
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   - trend WBC
   - plan to continue intubation at current settings until mental status
   improves; trial of PSV now and anticipate extubation tomorrow if
   possible
   .
   #  hypotension: SBP on floor low 80s, likely [**2-19**] midazolam and propofol
   given previously normotensive in ED.  Less likely [**2-19**] sepsis given
   overall clinical picture.  No indication of cardiogenic shock.  Adrenal
   insufficiency is also on the differential given recent course of
   prednisone, although 2 weeks should not cause adrenal failure.
   - IVF bolus
   - stop propofol - will restart as boluses or low rate
   - consider a-line and/or CVL if BP continues to be unstable

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been sedated with propofol.

The patient's recent course indicates frequent decompensations, including episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. Her ammonia level is elevated, and she is currently being treated with lactulose. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and a chest X-ray did not show any obvious infiltrate.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), given her low blood pressure on the floor. She is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and will continue to be monitored closely.

The patient's family would like to initiate a liver transplant work-up. Her Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is 23, and she is currently on Lasix and a beta-blocker at home doses. She will undergo further evaluation, including an ultrasound with doppler and possibly an endoscopic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract (EGD) for staging or screening purposes.

The patient also has leukocytosis with a neutrophil predominance, which may indicate an infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and if possible, asc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis presenting with altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy. She has been intubated for respiratory failure and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been started on prophylactic antibiotics and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. A paracentesis was performed to evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and empiric treatment with ceftriaxone is being continued. Anticoagulation for portal vein thrombosis is under discussion with hepatology. The patient also has leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and oliguria, which are being further evaluated. The patient is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Her ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and appropriate line management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction. It can lead to confusion, disorientation, and even coma if not properly managed. Monitoring the patient's neurologic status and maintaining lactulose therapy will be important to prevent complications.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This indicates severe impairment of gas exchange, possibly due to hypoventilation or pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and"

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 13542**] with the ICU fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 347**], whose
   note above reflects my input.  Did not tolerate SBT this morning due to
   tachypnea.  Had not been moving bowels
 NG suction but then began
   having bowel movements.  CXR today shows elevated left hemidiaphragm
   with ?very large gastric bubble.  U/S showed portal vein with slow flow
   or thrombus, as well as ascited.  Underwent paracentesis, which was
   inconsistent with SBP.  On exam she is somnolent.  Pupils are large but
   very reactive.  Regular heart.  Decreased breath sounds at bases.
   Protuberant lungs.
   Assessment and Plan
   54-year-old woman with hepatic encephalopathy leading to respiratory
   failure related to inability to protect airway.  Does not appear to
   have GIB or SBP as etiology of decompensation; portal vein thrombosis
   is possible
 will discuss with hepatology.   CT head at outside
   hospital did not show major intracranial pathology.   We will CT
   abdomen to exclude SBO and other anatomic causes of inability to
   tolerate lactulose
 may just need time.  Then, begin lactulose +/-
   rifaxamin.  If unable to tolerate lactulose from above, use enemas.
   Volume challenge for oliguria.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 347**] and the ICU team note from today.
   Discussed with patient
s son; all questions answered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with cirrhosis presenting with altered mental status secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. She is currently intubated for encephalopathy and on invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 125/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is on various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, cholestyramine, lactulose, lasix, fluoxetine, and ceftriaxone. She also has an OG/NG tube, Foley catheter, and a foley drain.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal electrolyte levels, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and decreased albumin. The imaging reveals a reversal of flow within the left portal vein, no color flow detected in the main portal vein or right portal vein, and large volume ascites.

The assessment and plan include hepatic encephalopathy without acute etiology but possible new portal vein thrombosis or worsening liver function."

   Assessment and Plan
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY:  No acute etiology found to date but possible
   new PV thrombosis or worsening liver function.
   -Paracentesis to evaluate for SBP.  Continue empiric treatment with
   ceftriaxone.
   -Not having BMs currently.  KUB does not demonstrate evidence of bowel
   obstruction.  Trial of PR lactulose.  Since going  for liver CT, will
   also image abdomen although ileus is more likely than bowel
   obstruction.
   -Discuss with hepatology if merits anticoagulation for PV thrombosis
   (acuity is unknown).
   > Respiratory Failure:
   Intubated for encephalopathy.
   SBT this am, lighten sedation to assess underlying mental status.
   Change to PSV.
   Repeat CXR today to evaluate for re-expansion of LLL and possible
   pneumonia.
   > Leukocytosis:
   Evaluate for SBP.  Cont empiric Ctx.
   >Metabolic acidosis:
   Non-gap acidosis.  Possibly from NS fluid resuscitation.  Not having
   significant NGT output.
   Check urine lytes.
   >Oliguria:
   Creatinine remains stable.  BP has improved since yesterday.
   Fluid challenge to see if urine output improves.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis presenting with altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including respiratory failure, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, and potential portal vein thrombosis. She is also showing signs of hepatic dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Imaging reveals large volume ascites and a possible new portal vein thrombosis. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a serious complication of liver disease characterized by cognitive impairment and altered mental status. It needs to be managed with lactulose and other supportive measures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infection. Evaluation for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is recommended, and empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone should be continued.
4. Metabolic acidosis: Non-gap acidosis may be present due to the administration of normal saline (NS) fluid resuscitation. Further evaluation and correction of electrolyte imbalances"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. She presents with altered mental status, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, ESLD, depression/anxiety, hyperlipidemia, guaiac positive stool, and a MELD score of 23. The patient's family wishes to initiate liver transplant work-up.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and respiratory failure due to the inability to protect the airway.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support, indicating respiratory failure. The underlying cause is primarily due to hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or Clostridium difficile colitis. Empiric treatment with ceftriaxone has been started.
4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which could be due to infection-related sepsis or ESLD. Intravenous fluids and HCO3 boluses are being administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
5. ESLD: The patient's liver disease is causing complications and may require liver transplant"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. She presents with altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is often seen in patients with liver failure and is characterized by changes in brain function. Treatment involves using lactulose to reduce the levels of ammonia in the blood, which can contribute to the development of hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Cirrhotic Liver: The abdominal/chest CT scan shows a shrunken, cirrhotic liver. Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. It leads to liver dysfunction and can eventually progress to ESLD.

3. Ascites: The CT scan also reveals the presence of ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Ascites is commonly associated with liver cirrhosis and can contribute to complications like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

4. Left-Sided Pleural Effusion with Adjacent Atelectasis vs. Pneumonia: The CT scan shows a left-sided pleural effusion, which is the accumulation of fluid in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 12-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and difficulty breathing. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and subsequent endotracheal intubation. The patient has a history of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis with associated complications such as ascites and pleural effusion. He also has hepatic encephalopathy, as evidenced by abnormal mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/52 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 16 mEq/L, base excess of -8, oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 330, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range, but he has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin level, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient is receiving intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics (ceftriaxone), propofol, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,486 mL and output of 1,566 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,920 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes endotracheal tube placement, CPAP/PSV mode ventilation, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, skin is not assessed, and neurologic examination is not performed. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's medical history includes NASH and cirrhosis with associated complications, and his family history is unchanged from admission. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's abnormal mental status may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of cirrhosis. This condition can lead to altered levels of consciousness and cognitive dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty breathing and subsequent endotracheal intubation suggest"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. She presents with altered mental status. The patient has cirrhotic liver, ascites, and left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis versus pneumonia. Diagnostic para was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60/42 mmHg to 86/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving propofol infusion, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and ceftriaxone. The patient has leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, indicating possible infection. There is a concern for hypotension, but it has resolved. The patient also has hyperlipidemia and guaiac-positive stool. The assessment and plan include treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, ESLD, hypotension, leukocytosis, depression/anxiety, hyperlipidemia, and guaiac-positive stool. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

   Inability to protect airway: can likely come off ventilator once mental
   status improved
   Leukocytosis: will check C.diff, will follow up [**Last Name (LF) 13551**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send
   sputum cultures
   SBP: on longterm SBP prophylaxis will continue ceftraixone
   Acidosis: likely [**2-19**] to diarrhea.
   Creatinine elevation: will hold lasix,  will replete with IVF boluses
   as needed, willl give her sodium bicarb boluses.
   Depression/anxiety: continue prozac.
   Guiac positive stools: continue to monitor, will re-guiac here.
   Elevated PTT: hold s/c heparin until PTT comes down the resume [**Hospital1 7**].

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and increasing hospitalizations for hepatic encephalopathy. She was admitted with encephalopathy and intubated due to an inability to protect her airway. The patient's problem list includes hepatic encephalopathy with possible portal vein thrombosis, acute respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), leukocytosis, and guaiac positive stools.

The patient's condition has been managed with lactulose for encephalopathy, antibiotics for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and supportive care. However, the patient's mental status has not improved despite being off propofol, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection given the leukocytosis.

There are potential medical complications that can arise in this case. Some of these complications include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen if not properly managed with lactulose and other supportive measures.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to wean her off the ventilator once her mental status improves.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels should be addressed promptly to prevent cardiac complications.

4. ARF: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy and respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to an inability to protect her airway. Her problem list includes hepatic encephalopathy, acute respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, and guaiac positive stools. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This condition can worsen over time and may require adjustments in lactulose dosing due to copious stool output.
2. Inability to Protect Airway: The patient may need ongoing respiratory support, and weaning from the ventilator may be challenging.
3. Leukocytosis: Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying cause, and there is a risk of developing infections such as Clostridium difficile.
4. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Prophylaxis against SBP should be continued, especially since the patient has been on long-term prophylaxis.
5. Acidosis: Diarrhea can contribute to metabolic acidosis, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
6. Creatinine Elevation: Renal insufficiency may require adjustments in fluid and medication management, including holding lasix and repleting with intravenous fluids as needed.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple admissions to the hospital for hepatic encephalopathy. She presents with altered mental status and respiratory failure, mostly due to the inability to protect her airway because of encephalopathy. There is no significant apparent pulmonary process that would explain the respiratory failure.

The patient's assessment includes renal failure, NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), hepatic encephalopathy, leukocytosis with possible C. diff colitis or SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), hypotension with elevated creatinine possibly due to infection, ESLD secondary to NASH with a MELD score of 23, depression/anxiety, hyperlipidemia, and a guaiac positive stool.

The plan includes continuing ventilatory support and weaning off slowly as mental status allows, continuing lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, continuing ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of SBP, f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures, and monitoring urine output closely while holding furosemide. The family would like to initiate a liver transplant work-up, and the patient has been placed on full code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, development of hepatorenal syndrome, further deterioration of liver function leading to increased hepatic encephalopathy, development of respiratory infections"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis and recent decompensation. She is currently admitted to the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and sedated, unable to provide a medical history. Allergies are unknown. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and low lung volumes. Laboratory results indicate renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, and altered coagulation profile. Imaging reveals moderate pleural effusion, left lower lobe consolidation, elevated diaphragm, and moderate ascites consistent with cirrhosis. The patient has a history of depression/anxiety, hyperlipidemia, and positive guaiac stool test.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to an inability to protect her airway caused by hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy, which may be exacerbated by sedation.
3. Renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to an infection such as Clostridium difficile colitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or pneumonia. However, C. diff is negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of cirrhosis and is currently in the ICU due to recent decompensation. The patient has been started on lactulose and diuretics. The patient's low lung volumes are a new finding. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 93 bpm (88-123 bpm), blood pressure of 91/48 mmHg (91/45-142/72 mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (10-31 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,752 mL with 251 mL output through the PO site, 80 mL output through the TF site, 2,632 mL input through the IVF site, 200 mL blood product transfusion, and a total output of 1,241 mL through the urine, NG tube, stool, and drains. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 555 mL (346-569 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 80. The patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 313.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.5-20.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.3-34.8 %, platelet (Plt) count of 69-109 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 47 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8-1.6 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 17 mmol/L, glucose of 107-167 mg/dL, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 25.8/2.5, liver enzymes (ALT/AST) of 68/74 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) of 142 U/L, total bilirubin (T Bili) of 6.3 mg/dL, and other lab values as noted.

The patient's imaging studies show findings consistent with cirrhosis, moderate left pleural effusion with left lower lobe consolidation likely representing compressive atelectasis, elevated diaphragm, moderate simple ascites, colonic distention with air fluid levels, body wall edema suggestive of fluid overload, and L4 body focal hypodensity of unclear etiology.

The patient's diagnosis includes acute renal failure, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   2. Liver failure:
    - cont lactulose for encephalopathy
    - cont ceftriaxone for sbp prophylaxis
    - f/u coags, lfts
    - touch base with liver service
    - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and cbc given prior hct drop and guaiac +
    - will t/b with radiology regarding possible portal vein thrombosis,
   will likely require a/c when coags improve
   3. HoTN: improved with IVF, continue IVF bolus as needed
   4. AoCRF: improved after albumin trial, likely prerenal, less likely
   HRS given response
    - cont monitor, albumin 25% bolus as needed
   5. Coagulopathy: rising INR despite other liver function tests
   improving.  Will give Vit K and continue to follow

   I saw and examined the pt, and was present with the ICU team for the
   key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**]
s note, and
   would add/emphasize:
   54 yo female with NASH cirrhosis admitted with hepatic encephalopathy
   and acute respiratory failure [**2-19**] inability to protect airway. No
   obvious GI bleed or infection as precipitant, was found to have
   probable portal vein thrombosis by abdominal US. Acute renal
   insufficiency improved with albumin challenge suggesting pre-renal
   azotenia. Extubated this morning.
   Major problems include-
   1.       Hepatic encephalopathy
 can intermittently turn head to
   direction, when encouraged by family (language barrier). Hard to
   determine whether this is significantly improved; however until this
   morning pt was on propofol for sedation. Try to minimize sedation as
   able, continue lactulose, CTX for SBP prophylaxis and will d/w
   hepatology re: adding rifaximin if MS doesn
t improve soon.
   2.       NASH cirrhosis- on lactulose, CTX, albumin daily. No current
   intervention for portal vein thrombosis
   3.       Anemia: checking hemolysis labs
   4.       Acute respiratory failure- extubated this morning, so far
   tolerating. Bilateral low lung volumes could be due to ascites/pleural
   effusion but as this was reportedly a new development, check ABG later
   today to r/o acute hypercarbia
   5.       Tachycardia: suspect [**2-19**] agitation as HR increases with when
   propofol was stopped; other possibilities include Bdz withdrawal (on
   clonazepam 2 mg QID as oupt); volume depletion- try low dose Bdz,
   re-dose albumin
   Family updated.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. She presented with hepatic decompensation and was intubated for airway protection. The patient has multiple medical complications including liver failure, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and potential portal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is a concern for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition requires continued lactulose therapy and monitoring for any signs of improvement. Rifaximin may be considered if there is no significant improvement.
2. NASH cirrhosis: The patient has a history of NASH cirrhosis, which is a progressive condition leading to liver dysfunction. Ongoing management includes lactulose, CTX for SBP prophylaxis, and consideration of additional interventions for portal vein thrombosis.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's recent extubation suggests improvement in respiratory status. However, monitoring for any signs of recurrent respiratory failure is essential, especially considering the possibility of low lung volumes due to ascites/pleural effusion.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's increased heart rate could be attributed to agitation, Bdz withdrawal, or volume"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. She presents with altered mental status, which is currently not assessable due to sedation. The patient has several medical conditions, including hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy secondary to ESLD, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypotension. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hepatic encephalopathy, development of gastrointestinal bleeding, progression of coagulopathy, infection, and potential need for liver transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and other neurological symptoms. It is crucial to monitor and manage this condition effectively to prevent further deterioration.
2. Development of Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Anemia is present, and there is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding or hemolysis. Monitoring for signs of GI bleed and conducting appropriate investigations are essential to identify and manage any bleeding promptly.
3. Progression of Coagulopathy: As the patient has coagulopathy secondary to ESLD, close monitoring of the coagulation profile is necessary to prevent or manage any bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient may be at an increased risk of infection due to ESLD and immunosup"

 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   54 yo woman with a history of ESLD and multiple recent admissions to
   OSH for hepatic encephalopathy presents with altered mental status
   likely from hepatic encephalopathy.
   # Hepatic encephalopathy:  Stable. No clear infectious trigger. RUQ u/s
   and liver CT done, showing shrunken liver. Mental status stable. Now
   off sedation and extubated.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin per liver recs
   - continue ciprofloxacin at ppx dose
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  secondary to ESLD
   - vitamin K 10 mg again today
   .
   # Leukocytosis: unclear etiology. Now resolved. Only on prophylatic
   dose of ciprofloxacin.
   .
   # Anemia:  concern for GI bleed or hemolysis.  Hct has been in mid 20s,
   stable in the past few days. Minimal blood from rectal tube yesterday
   is likely from hemorrhoids.
   - hemolysis labs
   - monitor for signs of GI bleed (has had guaiac + stool but no
   hemodynamic instability, etc)
   # Recent hypotension: with elevation of Cr, ?in the setting of
   infection. Now resolved.
   - IVF boluses as needed to maintain MAP > 65
   - monitor urine output closely
   - continue to hold furosemide
   #  ESLD:  Secondary to NASH.
   - f/u liver recs
   - treat encephalopathy as above
   #  depression/anxiety

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple recent admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. She presents with altered mental status likely from hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but has been extubated without difficulty. She is now on face tent with 4LNC and has been intermittently hypotensive, responsive to normal saline (NS) boluses. The patient also received 50g albumin. A nasogastric tube (NGT) has been placed, and she has started on rifaxamin, lactulose, and one dose of PO vitamin K through the NGT. She is experiencing slight blood-tinged stools, likely due to hemorrhoids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible acute renal failure. This could be secondary to hypotension or an underlying condition related to ESLD.
2. NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis): The patient has a history of ESLD and multiple recent admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. This suggests ongoing liver damage, possibly due to NASH.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease. It is essential to"
