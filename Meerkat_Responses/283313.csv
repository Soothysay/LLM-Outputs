","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, eczema, and allergies. She presented with new-onset tongue swelling this morning and was intubated in the emergency department. 

The patient has been diagnosed with angioedema, which is causing the tongue swelling. The treatment plan includes holding lisinopril, changing Benadryl to 50mg PO q6hrs, starting prednisone 60 mg PO daily, and continuing home Claritin. Awaiting feedback from the dermatologist regarding skin rashes, checking C4 and C1 inhibitor levels, and requesting an allergy consult are also part of the plan.

Additionally, there is a question mark regarding ST depression in inferior leads from the EKG taken in the emergency department. Cardiac enzymes have been negative three times, so continuing home metoprolol and zocor is advised.

The patient's other conditions such as eczema, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and osteoporosis have been addressed with their respective treatment plans.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on regular diet and has glycemic control measures in place. She has two IV lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and is being monitored for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is full code, confirmed with her daughter, and she will"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, heart failure, eczema, recent dermatologic rashes, and recent facial/lip swelling. She presented with new tongue swelling this morning and required intubation in the emergency department. The patient has been diagnosed with angioedema, which is causing tongue swelling. She also has a history of allergies to fish and sulfa, although she has not been recently exposed to them. She is currently extubated and awake, alert, and breathing spontaneously. Her vital signs are stable, and she shows improvement in her tongue edema. She is being treated with medications to manage her angioedema, including prednisone and Benadryl. Further tests, such as C4 and C1 inhibitor levels, are being considered to determine the cause of her angioedema. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no evidence of a heart attack. She will continue her home medications for atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Her eczema, high cholesterol, osteoporosis, and other medical conditions are also being managed. She will remain in the ICU for now and will be reassessed later today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient's current condition of tongue swelling indicates angioedema. If left untreated or poorly managed, it could lead to airway obstruction and respiratory distress.
2. Allergic reaction:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension on lisinopril, hyperlipidemia, eczema, recent dermatologic rashes, and recent facial/lip swelling. The patient presented with new tongue swelling this morning and was subsequently intubated in the emergency department.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and arousable, able to open eyes on command but unable to squeeze hands.

Physical examination reveals a markedly swollen tongue unable to visualize the back of the throat, no facial or periorbital swelling, normocephalic and atraumatic head, no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus, pupils equal and reactive, irregular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or last name, no jugular venous distention, clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly, soft abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly, no edema in the extremities, and a macular papular rash with excoriations on the right back and hip.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.9 g/dL, platelet count of 229 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T of <0.01, TCO2 of 22, glucose of 195 mg/dL, PT/PTT/INR of 27.3/30.3/2.7, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T of 43/2/<0.01, calcium of 8.8 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.8 mg/dL.

Assessment and plan include suspected angioedema leading to intubation, holding lisinopril, administering benadryl and steroids, continuing peptic, and awaiting dermatologist feedback on skin rashes. The patient also has possible ST depression in inferior leads from EKG in ED, negative cardiac enzymes, and continued home metoprolol. Eczema, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fen care are also noted.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening angioedema, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and electrolyte imbalances."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension on lisinopril, hyperlipidemia, eczema, recent dermatologic rashes, and recent facial/lip swelling. The patient presented with new tongue swelling this morning and was intubated in the ED due to difficulty talking secondary to tongue swelling. The patient also has a history of allergies to fish and sulfa, as well as hay fever as a child.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7 C (98 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/34 to 162/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, troponin T, and glucose levels. However, the patient's prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are elevated at 27.3 and 30.3 respectively, while the international normalized ratio (INR) is within the therapeutic range of 2.7.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including prednisone, Pepcid, Claritin, metoprolol, amlodipine, and coumadin. The patient's allergies and medical conditions are being managed accordingly, and further tests such as C4 and C1 inhibitor levels are being considered.

The patient's recent symptoms of tongue swelling and previous facial and lip swelling may indicate angioedema, which could be related to an allergic reaction or a deficiency in C1 inhibitor. The patient's recent dermatologic rashes are being followed by a dermatologist.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable, and appropriate measures are being taken to manage her various medical conditions and allergies. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any potential complications or changes in her condition."

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, allergies, eczema, and recent facial/lip swelling. She presented with new tongue swelling and was intubated in the emergency department. The patient has been diagnosed with angioedema, possibly related to an allergic reaction. She has been prescribed prednisone, an H2 blocker, and a continued Claritin. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no signs of a heart attack. She will follow up with allergy specialists for further evaluation. The patient's current condition is stable, and she is awake and alert.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Allergic reactions: Given the patient's history of allergies and recent facial/lip swelling, there is a possibility of future allergic reactions. Monitoring for any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction is essential.
2. Angioedema recurrence: Although the patient's current episode of angioedema has improved, there is a risk of recurrence. It is important to continue the prescribed medications and closely monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of tongue or facial swelling.
3. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. It is crucial to monitor her heart rhythm and blood pressure regularly to prevent any potential cardiovascular complications.
4. Infection: As the patient was recently hospitalized and intubated, there is a risk of developing infections such"
