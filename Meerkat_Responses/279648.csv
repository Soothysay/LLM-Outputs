","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, who presented with acute respiratory failure and was subsequently intubated. The patient is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been diagnosed with status asthmaticus, likely precipitated by either a urinary respiratory infection (URI) or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The viral culture for nasal aspirate is negative, and Gram-negative rods (GNRs) are present in the sputum, awaiting speciation. The patient is receiving MDIs (metered-dose inhalers) 10 puffs every 2 hours, nebulized bronchodilators for airway resistance less than 10, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to minimize breath stacking and improve oxygenation.

Additionally, the patient has been treated for NSTEMI (Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction), although the cardiology fellow was not officially consulted. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) showed demand ischemia, and heparin infusion has been discontinued.

The patient also presented with coffee ground nasogastric tube output, which has since cleared. This was likely due to difficult intubation and ingestion of blood. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been prescribed.

The patient is also being monitored and managed for hypocalcemia, tube feeds, and peripheral IV lines. The patient's code status is full code, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient's primary condition is status asthmaticus, likely precipitated by an upper respiratory infection or community-acquired pneumonia. He is currently receiving continuous nebulizer treatments, IV solumedrol, and oral singulair. Cultures have been obtained, and coverage for possible CAP has been initiated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI, and there is a demand for cardiac ischemia assessment. The patient has not been officially consulted with a cardiology fellow. The recommended management includes cycling CE, administering ASA and heparin, starting a statin, and obtaining an EKG in the morning.

The patient also has coffee ground nasogastric tube output, which is most likely due to difficult intubation and ingested blood. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been ordered.

The patient is currently NPO, but electrolytes will be replenished as needed. He is on heparin gtt for prophylaxis, PPI, and a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle.

The patient has three lines: an 18-gauge and a 20-gauge in the right arm, and an arterial line in the left arm. Prophylaxis for deep vein throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with asthma exacerbation likely precipitated by community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Pseudomonas species were identified in the sputum culture. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with PCV mode and sedation to avoid breath stacking. The goal pH is 7.1-7.3 with permissive hypercapnea, and pCO2 goal is less than 90. Steroid dosage is being decreased, and the patient is already on Singular. The patient also has a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and anticoagulation therapy has been discontinued as C-reactive protein (CRP) trends down. The patient had coffee ground nasogastric tube output, which has since cleared, likely due to difficult intubation and ingested blood. Hypocalcemia has resolved. The patient is receiving tube feeds according to nutrition recommendations and will have electrolytes checked as needed. The patient is on full code status, and the wife has been contacted. The patient will be dispositioned to the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis ("

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with PCV+assist mode, receiving supplemental oxygen and antibiotics for a Pseudomonas infection. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/60-118/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1660 mL, output of 1530 mL, with a net balance of 130 mL. The patient has received multiple blood products and is receiving prophylactic heparin.

Potential Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of developing nosocomial infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of stress ulcers.
5. Fluid overload: Close monitoring of fluid balance is essential to prevent fluid overload.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure and required intubation. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to asthma exacerbation, likely precipitated by either upper respiratory infection (URI) or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's sputum viral culture was negative, and Gram-negative rods (GNRs) were found, awaiting speciation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PCV mode, sedation to avoid breath stacking, and goal pH between 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea. He is also receiving medications such as solumedrol, singular, and magnesium. The patient has a history of coffee ground nasogastric tube output, which has since cleared, most likely due to difficult intubation and ingested blood. There is also a mention of hypocalcemia, which needs to be corrected, and the initiation of tube feeds per nutrition recommendations. Additionally, the patient has been receiving prophylactic heparin, PPI, and VAP bundle. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

    64 year male with history of asthma presented to OSH with SOB and
   ultimately found to be in respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Was difficult intubation and also having difficulty ventilating in ED
   and therefore paralyzed pt. with some improvement and transferred to
   the ICU.  In ICU has had severe bronchospasm a

   Plan:
   1)       Continue to slowly decrease rate and increase expiratory time
   with allowance for permissive hypercapnea
   2)       Change antibiotic coverage to cover pseudomonas (Zosyn) and
   will keep atypicals (levoquin)

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be in respiratory failure. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to difficulty ventilating in the emergency department. In the ICU, he experienced severe bronchospasm and had a difficult intubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on mechanical ventilation. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.24, pCO2 of 81 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 32 mEq/L.

The patient's chest X-ray revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate with an interstitial pattern. His sputum culture grew pseudomonas, leading to a change in antibiotic coverage to levofoxacin and zosyn.

The patient's physical examination shows poor air movement in the lungs bilaterally with faint wheezing. He has normal heart sounds, soft abdomen with no tenderness or guarding, and no edema in his extremities.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently intubated and sedated. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which may be secondary to severe asthma or pseudomonal pneumonia versus community-acquired pneumonia. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, acute myocardial infarction, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and they require mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is still receiving antibiotics. There is a risk of developing further infections or complications related to their compromised immune system.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding.
4. Acute Myocardial Infarction: The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is currently positive, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory failure, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. They have a history of severe asthma, acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PCV mode, with a set rate of 16 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 514 mL. Oxygenation is being supported with an FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate between 67-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 77/59-116/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an SpO2 of 97%. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged stay on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and appropriate infection control measures should be taken.
2. Nosocomial infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization, there is a higher risk of developing nosocomial infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and surveillance cultures may help in early detection and management.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia presenting with acute respiratory failure and subsequent intubation. He has been diagnosed with status asthmaticus, likely precipitated by community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Sputum culture revealed growth of pansensitive Pseudomonas, for which he is being covered with Zosyn.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, demand ischemia, coffee ground nasogastric tube output, and hypocalcemia. His respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation in PCV mode with assist, set RR at 16, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and sedation with propofol.

He has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). His vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, but decreased temperature and oxygen saturation. His fluid balance indicates an overall positive balance.

Laboratory results show elevated triglycerides, slightly low platelet count, normal WBC count, and abnormal arterial blood gas values with respiratory acidosis. Other lab results are within normal range.

The plan includes continuing solumedrol, Singular, and MDIs every 2 hours. Frequent MDIs are recommended to maintain airway resistance below 10. Additionally, albuterol is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The main medical complications and conditions include:

1. Status asthmaticus: The patient presented with an asthma exacerbation, most likely precipitated by a chest infection (CAP). Pseudomonas was identified in the sputum, and the patient is being treated with MDIs, frequent nebs, PCV ventilation, sedation, and goal airway resistance < 10.

2. NSTEMI: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with declining cardiac enzyme (CE) trends. Heparin was discontinued, and the patient is currently on ASA and statin therapy.

3. Coffee ground NGT output: The patient initially had coffee ground nasogastric tube output, which has since cleared. This was likely due to difficult intubation and ingested blood. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was given.

4. Hypocalcemia: The patient had hypocalcemia, which has since resolved.

   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 4.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure. He has been mechanically ventilated for five days and initially received empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. However, the treatment was changed to levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam once pseudomonas infection was identified. The patient's ventilatory status has remained stable but has failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of the asthma exacerbation.

The patient is currently on several medications including ipratropium, albuterol, solu-MEDROL, propofol, fentanyl, and magnesium sulfate. He is also receiving tube feeds per nutrition recommendations.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and pressure injuries. The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and the ICU care plan includes measures to prevent VAP such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, including oxygen saturation levels, to detect any signs of worsening respiratory failure. Regular assessment of the patient's nutritional status is also crucial to ensure adequate intake and prevent malnutrition. Additionally, the patient's medication regimen should be regularly evaluated and adjusted as needed to optimize his condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure and was subsequently intubated. The patient has asthma exacerbation with sputum viral culture negative, but GNRs were identified as pseudomonas, which is pansensitive. He is being treated with MDIs, albuterol, PCV ventilation with sedation, and propofol to minimize breath stacking. 

The patient also has hyperkalemia, for which he received kayexalate. There were concerns about demand ischemia, but CEs trended down and heparin gtt was discontinued. The patient had coffee ground NGT output, which has since cleared, likely due to difficult intubation and ingested blood. 

His labs show low white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and low albumin levels. The patient is on full code status and currently in the ICU.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further due to the underlying asthma exacerbation and potential infection with pseudomonas. This could lead to increased difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: With the identification of pseudomonas in the sputum, there is a risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic coverage are essential to prevent or manage such infections.
3. Hyperkalemia:"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have a PICC line in place, which needs to be replaced on Monday. The patient experienced hyperkalemia and received Kayexalate. Increased sedation was required to minimize overbreathing and breath stacking due to dysynchrony. The patient's oxygen saturation consistently remained around 90%. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and propofol, as well as other medications such as Lasix, heparin sodium, and lansoprazole. The patient has an OG/NG tube, a Foley catheter, and is on tube feeds. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/66 mmHg to 188/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and their height is recorded as 70 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,227 mL and output of 2,290 mL, resulting in a balance of 937 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at PCV+Assist mode. The set respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, PEEP is at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 is 40%, and SpO2 is 92%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 72 mmHg, Pa"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #5.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially ws treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 5.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Mini-BAL [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms
   seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #5.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 5.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Not on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]. Mini-BAL [**2-10**] revealed PMNs,
   no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name12 (NameIs) 4653**] culture, with gram stain/culture, PCP smear, and
   fungal culture
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol 10 puffs q 2 hours for
   goal airway resistance < 10
   - Continue PO albuterol to ensure bronchodilatory effects on distal
   airways
   - PCV ventilation with sedation and permissive hypercapnia to avoid
   breath stacking, propofol preferential to fentanyl, will do trial of PS
   now and check ABG
   - Try RR 12 if tolerates
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - cont solumedrol 80 mg IV q8h with plan to taper once clinically
   improving
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - consider Pulmonary c/s if no improvement in the next 24-48 hours
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg and statin.
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes
   - Check lytes this afternoon, adjust free water as indicated
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   - Maintain Mg>3; will replete this AM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure. He was initially treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia but later found to have a pan-sensitive pseudomonas infection. The patient has been mechanically ventilated for five days and has not shown improvement.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe asthma exacerbation has led to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. Failure to improve raises concerns for alternate causes, such as pneumonia or other lung infections.

2. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient's sputum culture was positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas. This indicates a bacterial infection caused by pseudomonas, which can be challenging to treat and may contribute to respiratory failure.

3. Steroid-Dependent Asthma: The patient has a history of steroid-dependent asthma, suggesting that he may require long-term use of corticosteroids to manage his asthma symptoms. This could increase the risk of side effects associated with chronic steroid use.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's troponin levels were initially elevated, indicating a possible cardiac event. However, the CK levels were flat, and troponins trended down, suggesting that the cardiac issue may have resolved or was not significant.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of steroid-dependent asthma presenting with severe asthma attack and diffuse tree-in-bud pattern on CT. He became more hypernatremic and started fluid boluses. The patient has no known drug allergies. He received antibiotics (levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and was intubated in the emergency department due to respiratory failure. The patient remains critically ill and is on pressure control ventilation with poor resistance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is secondary to severe asthma exacerbation and pneumonia. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by melena. Further investigation and management are necessary to identify the cause and prevent further bleeding.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Monitoring the patient's potassium levels and taking appropriate measures to stabilize them is essential.
4. Myocardial Infarction: There is a concern for an acute myocardial infarction, as evidenced by changes in the electrocardiogram (EKG). Prompt evaluation and management of cardiac enzymes are necessary.
5. Infection: The patient has pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Proper antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the sensitivity results"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #5.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 6.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   - Follow-up Mini-BAL culture
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol 10 puffs q 2 hours for
   goal airway resistance < 10
   - Continue PO albuterol to ensure bronchodilatory effects on distal
   airways
   - Pressure control ventilation with sedation and permissive hypercapnia
   to avoid breath stacking, propofol preferential to fentanyl
   - Pressure support trial today
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - cont solumedrol 80 mg IV q8h with plan to taper once clinically
   improving
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - consider Pulmonary c/s if no improvement in the next 24-48 hours
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg and statin.
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; will give an additional 1L D5W today
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   - Maintain Mg>3; will replete this AM

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #5.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 6.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   - Follow-up Mini-BAL culture
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol 10 puffs q 2 hours for
   goal airway resistance < 10
   - Continue PO albuterol to ensure bronchodilatory effects on distal
   airways
   - Pressure control ventilation with sedation and permissive hypercapnia
   to avoid breath stacking, propofol preferential to fentanyl
   - Pressure support trial today
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - cont solumedrol 80 mg IV q8h with plan to taper once clinically
   improving
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - consider Pulmonary c/s if no improvement in the next 24-48 hours
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg and statin.
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; will give an additional 1L D5W today
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.

The patient had a pressure support trial which initially went well but then worsened with decreased volumes and tachypnea. He was placed on volume control ventilation and did well. The goal is to follow up with a Mini-BAL culture and continue ipratropium and albuterol to ensure bronchodilatory effects on distal airways.

The patient also has elevated troponin levels at admission, but CK levels are flat, and troponins are trending down. No longer trending. This indicates a potential demand ischemia, and the patient should continue ASA 81 mg and statin therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #6.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 6.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   - Follow-up Mini-BAL culture
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol 10 puffs q 2 hours for
   goal airway resistance < 10
   - Continue PO albuterol to ensure bronchodilatory effects on distal
   airways
   - Pressure control ventilation with sedation and permissive hypercapnia
   to avoid breath stacking, propofol preferential to fentanyl
   - Pressure support trial today
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - cont solumedrol 80 mg IV q8h with plan to taper once clinically
   improving
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - goal rate of 12 with larger tidal volumes
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 6 of 14
   - d/c ASA
   - add theophylline
   - re-scan chest to evaluate lung fields
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending.
   -          Continue statin.
   -          d/c ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; will preferentially put free water
   in TFs rather than giving additional fluids
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   - Maintain Mg>3; will replete this AM

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure. He was initially treated empirically with ceftriaxone/azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia but was later changed to levofloxacin/Zosyn once pseudomonas was identified. The patient has been mechanically ventilated for 6 days and has failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of the asthma exacerbation. Mini-BAL revealed PMNs without organisms, suggesting no Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). A follow-up Mini-BAL culture is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe asthma exacerbation has led to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. It is essential to closely monitor and manage his ventilatory status.
2. Infection: The presence of pan-sensitive pseudomonas in the sputum culture indicates a potential infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
3. Steroid-Dependent Asthma: The patient's history of steroid-dependent asthma increases the risk of complications associated with long-term steroid use, such as immunosuppression and bone density loss.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: The elevated troponin at admission suggests myocardial injury, which may indicate cardiac ischemia. Continuous monitoring of cardiac enzymes and symptoms of"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #5.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 5.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Not on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]. Mini-BAL [**2-10**] revealed PMNs,
   no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name12 (NameIs) 4653**] culture, with gram stain/culture, PCP smear, and
   fungal culture
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol 10 puffs q 2 hours for
   goal airway resistance < 10
   - Continue PO albuterol to ensure bronchodilatory effects on distal
   airways
   - PCV ventilation with sedation and permissive hypercapnia to avoid
   breath stacking, propofol preferential to fentanyl, will do trial of PS
   now and check ABG
   - Try RR 12 if tolerates
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - cont solumedrol 80 mg IV q8h with plan to taper once clinically
   improving
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - consider Pulmonary c/s if no improvement in the next 24-48 hours
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg and statin.
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes
   - Check lytes this afternoon, adjust free water as indicated
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe asthma exacerbation. Rapid viral screen was negative at the time of presentation, but sputum culture was positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas. The patient has been receiving Levofloxacin and Zosyn for treatment.

His ventilatory status has remained stable but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this asthma exacerbation. The patient has a history of steroid-dependent asthma for several years and is not on PCP prophylaxis. Mini-BAL revealed PMNs, no organisms seen, and LDH levels are normal, suggesting that PCP may not be the cause of the exacerbation.

The patient's current medications include ipratropium q4 hours, albuterol 10 puffs q2 hours, PO albuterol, PCV ventilation with sedation and permissive hypercapnia, propofol preferential to fentanyl, and a trial of PS with ABG monitoring. The goal pH is 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath stacking, and pCO2 goal is less than 90. The patient is also receiving solumedrol 80 mg IV q8h with a plan to taper once clinically improving, singular 10 mg daily, and magnesium > 3.0.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for five days, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Pseudomonas infection: The sputum culture revealed pan-sensitive pseudomonas, indicating a bacterial infection. This infection could worsen the patient's respiratory status.
3. Steroid-dependent asthma exacerbation: The patient has a history of steroid-dependent asthma, and it is possible that the current exacerbation may be due to this underlying condition.
4. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's troponin levels were initially elevated, suggesting cardiac ischemia. However, the CK levels were flat and troponins trended down, indicating that this may not be a significant concern at the moment.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient had an elevated sodium level, which improved with free water flushes. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, but there is a risk of malnutrition due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and inability to eat normally.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
8. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to the critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.

Please note that these are potential medical complications and may not be the actual issues the patient is facing."

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have reviewed and agree with the assessment and plan as described
   above by the fellow with the following modifications and emphasis:
    64 year male with history of asthma presented to OSH with SOB and
   ultimately found to be in respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   Was difficult intubation and also having difficulty ventilating in ED

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath. He was found to be in respiratory failure and required intubation. The intubation was difficult, and the patient experienced ventilation difficulties in the ED, leading to paralysis. There was some improvement, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.

In the ICU, the patient is currently on volume control ventilation. His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, pulse rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated but is off paralytics at this time.

Physical examination reveals poor air movement in the lungs bilaterally with faint wheezing. The heart sounds are normal, the abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there is no edema present. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.4, pCO2 of 64 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 42 mEq/L. The chest X-ray is improving, and sputum culture is positive for Pseudomonas.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure secondary to severe asthma exacerbation/pneumonia.
2. Asthma Exacerbation.
3. Pneumonia (P"

","The patient is a critically ill male with severe asthma and atypical pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system, which shows diffuse expiratory wheeze and prolonged expiratory phase. The physical examination also reveals no mucus or secretions in the back of the throat.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 228 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 140 mg/dL. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), gastrointestinal bleed (melena), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

The plan includes continuing steroid treatment for severe asthma and atypical pneumonia, maintaining a respiratory rate at 12 breaths per minute, and further evaluation with miniBAL GNRs. The patient is also being given albuter"

   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #6.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 6.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   - Follow-up Mini-BAL culture
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol 10 puffs q 2 hours for
   goal airway resistance < 10
   - Continue PO albuterol to ensure bronchodilatory effects on distal
   airways
   - Pressure control ventilation with sedation and permissive hypercapnia
   to avoid breath stacking, propofol preferential to fentanyl
   - Pressure support trial today
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - cont solumedrol 80 mg IV q8h with plan to taper once clinically
   improving
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - goal rate of 12 with larger tidal volumes
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 6 of 14
   - d/c ASA
   - add theophylline
   - re-scan chest to evaluate lung fields
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending.
   -          Continue statin.
   -          d/c ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; will preferentially put free water
   in TFs rather than giving additional fluids
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   - Maintain Mg>3; will replete this AM

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure and severe asthma exacerbation.

2. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for the sixth day. Initial treatment included Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia, but it was changed to Levofloxacin and Zosyn once Pseudomonas was identified. He is still receiving Levofloxacin and Zosyn.

3. The ventilatory status has remained stable, but there is concern for alternate causes of the asthma exacerbation. The patient's outpatient records indicate a history of steroid-dependent asthma.

4. Mini-BAL revealed PMNs, no organisms seen, and normal LDH levels, suggesting that Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is unlikely. A subsequent bronchoscopy culture grew two species of Gram-negative rods, which are concerning for oral flora and awaiting speciation.

5. The patient initially did well on a pressure support trial but then worsened and was placed on volume control ventilation. He responded well to this change.

6. The patient's electrolytes are somewhat deranged with hyperkalemia and hypomagnesemia. These imbalances need to be corrected.

7. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation for the sixth day. The patient has been treated with Levofloxacin and Zosyn for pseudomonas infection. His ventilatory status has remained stable but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this asthma exacerbation. The patient has a history of steroid-dependent asthma and is currently on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis. Mini-BAL revealed PMNs without organisms, suggesting it may not be PCP. A follow-up Mini-BAL culture showed growth of pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, with hyperkalemia and hypomagnesemia. He also has an elevated troponin level, indicating possible myocardial infarction. The patient's fluid balance is positive, and he has received blood products. His nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is a critical condition requiring immediate attention.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are high, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium levels are low, which can cause muscle cramps, irregular heartbeat, and other complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma who presented with shortness of breath and was found to be in respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient was difficult to ventilate in the emergency department and subsequently paralyzed. He was transferred to the ICU but has been persistently difficult to wean off mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 191/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L, chloride level of 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 40 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen level of 25 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 123 mg/dL, and a low platelet count of 229 K/uL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The note indicates that the patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder with hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), gastrointestinal bleed (melena, GI bleed), and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). Additionally, there are other ongoing medical issues such as asthma attack with pneumonia (PNA), hypertension (htn), and femoral hernia repair (FEN).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of melena suggests ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires prompt evaluation and management to prevent further blood loss and potential shock.

3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and measures need to be taken to improve oxygenation and ventilation. This may involve adjusting ventilator settings, providing supplemental oxygen, and addressing any underlying causes of respiratory failure.

4. Asthma exacerbation with pneumonia: The patient's asthma attack is associated with pneumonia, and appropriate treatment is necessary to manage both conditions. This may include bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and other supportive measures.

5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be controlled to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications and improve overall organ perfusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #7.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 7.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   Discontinued ASA given potential for bronchospasm.
   -  Mini-BAL culture: Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive; on Zosyn
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol 10 puffs q 2 hours for
   goal airway resistance < 10
   - Continue PO albuterol to ensure bronchodilatory effects on distal
   airways
   - Pressure control ventilation with sedation and permissive hypercapnia
   to avoid breath stacking, propofol preferential to fentanyl
   - Pressure support trial today
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - Prednisone 60mg daily
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - goal rate of 12 with larger tidal volumes
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 7 of 14
   - add theophylline IV, now on oral formulation
   - Diurese, goal -1 to 1.5 Liters today
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending.
   - Continue statin.
   - d/c'd ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HTN: Has been more increased lately, could be [**1-7**] to agitation but
   does have baseline HTN.
   -  Increase home Dilt to 240mg total daily (60 QID)
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes.
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; but will try and decrease overall
   volume intake
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   - Maintain Mg>3; will replete this AM

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure and was placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's sputum culture was positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas, and he is currently being treated with Levofloxacin and Zosyn. The patient's ventilatory status has remained stable but has not improved, raising concerns for alternate causes of the asthma exacerbation. The patient's previous records indicate a history of steroid-dependent asthma and prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Mini-BAL revealed PMNs without organisms, indicating that PCP may not be the cause of the exacerbation. The patient has also shown improvement in hypernatremia with free water flushes. The patient's troponin levels were elevated initially but have trended down. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient is at risk due to endotracheal intubation and the presence of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract.
2. Barotrauma: The patient's asthma exacerbation and high airway pressures during mechanical ventilation can lead to barotrauma, causing lung injury.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Overdistension of the alveoli due to high tidal volumes can"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure and was placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas infection and is currently being treated with Levofloxacin and Zosyn. His ventilatory status has remained stable but has failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of the asthma exacerbation. The patient has a history of steroid-dependent asthma and is on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis. A mini-BAL revealed PMNs, no organisms seen, and LDH normal, so it may not be PCP. The patient's labs show hyperkalemia, elevated troponin levels indicating myocardial ischemia, and electrolyte/fluid disorders. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, and myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe asthma exacerbation has resulted in acute respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. There is a concern that the patient may not improve, which could lead to prolonged respiratory failure.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has melena (upper gastrointestinal bleed). This can lead to significant blood loss and anemia, potentially compromising tissue oxygenation and organ function.

3. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial ischemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be in respiratory failure. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU due to difficulty ventilating. The patient has been persistently difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation and has severe underlying pulmonary disease.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 191/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. On examination, the patient appears to be intubated and sedated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally with decreased expiratory noise. The heart sounds are normal (S1 S2). The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there are no signs of edema in the extremities. An arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.4 and elevated pCO2 of 81. A chest X-ray reveals an improved tree-in-bud pattern. The sputum culture is positive for Pseudomonas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure secondary to severe asthma exacerbation/pneumonia
2. Asthma Exacerbation
3. Pneumonia (Pseudomonas)/?atypical pneumonia

Plan:
1. Attempt spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) again today
2. Change to Presadex to see if we can wean more effectively
3. Continue albuterol/steroids/diuresis
4. Continue Zosyn/levaquin
5. Discontinue theophylline due to arrhythmias"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing various health issues, including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and an acute myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs are being closely monitored, and they are receiving multiple medications and treatments to manage their conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern, as indicated by their need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further deterioration in lung function could arise.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to complications like hypotension, shock, and potential need for blood transfusions.
3. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient has had an AMI, which increases the risk of complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and further cardiac events.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient is showing signs of electrolyte disorders, specifically hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed appropriately.
5. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
6. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immob"

   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #9.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 9.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who presented with acute respiratory failure. He is currently mechanically ventilated for the past 9 days and has been treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia. However, the ventilatory status has remained stable but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this asthma exacerbation. The patient has a history of steroid-dependent asthma and is currently on Levofloxacin and Zosyn. Mini-BAL revealed PMNs without organisms, suggesting that it may not be Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Cultures from mini-BAL grew two species of Gram-negative rods, which are concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation. The patient had a pressure support trial initially but then worsened, leading to being placed on volume control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe asthma exacerbation has led to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation for the past 9 days. There is concern about the failure to improve, indicating potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or other lung infections.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension multiple times, including a significant drop to 70/40s after an arterial line flush. This could be due to sepsis, medication side effects, or fluid imbalance.
3. Hypercapnia: The patient's goal is to maintain a pH of 7.2"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation, now mechanical ventilation day #8.  Rapid viral screen
   negative at time of presentation.  Sputum culture positive for
   pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially was treated empirically with
   Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, but
   changed to Levo/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated.  He is currently
   on Levofloxacin & Zosyn, day # 8.   Ventilatory status has remained
   stable, but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of
   this asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid
   dependent asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   Discontinued ASA given potential for bronchospasm.
   -  Mini-BAL culture: Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive; on Zosyn
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol 10 puffs q 2 hours for
   goal airway resistance < 10
   - Pressure support trial today
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - Prednisone 60mg daily
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - goal rate of 12 with larger tidal volumes
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 8 of 14
   - add theophylline IV, now on oral formulation but discontinued given
   tachycardia and hypertension
   - Diurese, goal -1 to 1.5 Liters [**2-14**] but then hypotensive; will try to
   run even
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending.
   - Continue statin.
   - d/c'd ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HTN: Has been more increased lately, could be [**1-7**] to agitation but
   does have baseline HTN.
   -  Increase home Dilt to 240mg total daily (60 QID)
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes.
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; but will try and decrease overall
   volume intake
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   - Maintain Mg>3; will replete this AM

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. He is currently extubated and on respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 47. His vital signs show a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 145/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a history of hypertension, asthma, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and lansoprazole (Prevacid). The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated potassium level, low magnesium level, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's assessment includes electrolyte and fluid disorder, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level indicates hyperkalemia. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (melena). Continued bleeding can result in significant blood loss, shock, and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, acute exacerbation of asthma, or pulmonary embolism. This"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be in respiratory failure. He required intubation and transfer to the ICU due to difficulty ventilating. The patient has been persistently difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing difficulty with weaning suggest the possibility of acute respiratory failure, which could be secondary to severe asthma exacerbation or pneumonia.
2. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma and current symptoms may indicate an exacerbation of his underlying respiratory condition.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of Pseudomonas in the sputum sample suggests a possible bacterial infection, specifically pneumonia. This could contribute to the patient's respiratory distress and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
4. Hyperkalemia: The lab results indicate elevated potassium levels, which could be due to various factors such as renal dysfunction, acidosis, or medication effects.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The mention of melena suggests a potential gastrointestinal bleed, which could be caused by stress ulcers or other underlying conditions.
6. Myocardial Infarction: Although not explicitly stated in the note, the patient's age and the presence of chest pain or abnormal cardiac markers may raise suspicion for an acute myocardial infarction.

It is important to note that these"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation.  Rapid viral screen negative at time of presentation.
   Sputum culture positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially
   was treated empirically with Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for
   community-acquired pneumonia, but changed to Levo/Zosyn once
   pseudomonas was speciated.   Ventilatory status has remained stable,
   but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this
   asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid dependent
   asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   Discontinued ASA given potential for bronchospasm.  Theophylline
   discontinued given tachycardia and hypertension.   Extubated [**2-15**],
   appeared to have continued respiratory distress throughout day but no
   significant changes on repeat ABGs.
   -  Mini-BAL culture: Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive; on Zosyn
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol nebs
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - Prednisone 60mg daily
 solumedrol while NPO
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily once no longer NPO
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 10 of 14
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending. ECHO [**2-15**],
   hyperdynamic.
   - Continue statin once no longer NPO
   - d/c'd ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HTN: Has been more increased lately, could be [**1-7**] to agitation but
   does have baseline HTN.
   -          Home Dilt 180mg total daily, holding given NPO
   -          started on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] increase enalaprit today
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes.
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; but will try and decrease overall
   volume intake
   # FEN:  NPO, OG tube removed during extubation
   - Maintain Mg>3
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 4514**] [**Name (NI) 4515**], wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4516**]
   DISPO:  Keep in the ICU under close monitoring for 24-48 hours longer

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation.  Rapid viral screen negative at time of presentation.
   Sputum culture positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially
   was treated empirically with Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for
   community-acquired pneumonia, but changed to Levo/Zosyn once
   pseudomonas was speciated.   Ventilatory status has remained stable,
   but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this
   asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid dependent
   asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   Discontinued ASA given potential for bronchospasm.  Theophylline
   discontinued given tachycardia and hypertension.   Extubated [**2-15**],
   appeared to have continued respiratory distress throughout day but no
   significant changes on repeat ABGs.
   -  Mini-BAL culture: Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive; on Zosyn
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol nebs
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - Prednisone 60mg daily
 solumedrol while NPO
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 10 of 14
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending. ECHO [**2-15**],
   hyperdynamic.
   - Continue statin.
   - d/c'd ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HTN: Has been more increased lately, could be [**1-7**] to agitation but
   does have baseline HTN.
   -          Increased home Dilt to 240mg total daily (60 QID), can
   tailor back if stays extubated
   -          started on ACE, can increase dose is still hypertensive when
   fluid off
   -          Switch all meds to IV while respiratory status tenous
   -          Consider nitro paste
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes.
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; but will try and decrease overall
   volume intake
   # FEN:  NPO, OG tube removed during extubation.
   - Maintain Mg>3; will replete this AM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of status asthmaticus. The patient was extubated at approximately 11am but continued to look poorly throughout the day. Oxygen saturation remained above 90% with ABGs being monitored. Anesthesia was paged and evaluated the patient due to a history of difficult airway. PO prednisone was changed to IV solumedrol per pharmacy dosing. An echo showed hyperdynamic function with an ejection fraction (Ef) greater than 75%. The patient remained tachycardic with a heart rate (HR) over 110 and hypertensive with systolic blood pressure (SBP) over 135. After falling asleep, the patient's vital signs improved. Enalapril was given for hypertension without significant effect. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. Infusions include lansoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium. Other medications are also listed. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, dry mouth, tachycardia, cough, and dyspnea. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth), agitated, and expresses a desire to die. 

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other parameters. The patient has received various treatments and interventions.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure and was found to have severe asthma exacerbation. The patient's sputum culture was positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas, so he was initially treated with ceftriaxone/azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia, but then switched to levofloxacin/Zosyn once pseudomonas was speciated. Despite being on ventilatory support, the patient failed to improve, leading to concerns about alternate causes for the asthma exacerbation.

The patient has a history of steroid-dependent asthma and was previously on Bactrim prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Mini-BAL revealed PMNs without organisms seen, suggesting it may not be PCP. The patient also had negative results for organisms and PCP on a bronchoscopy culture.

The patient underwent a pressure support trial initially, which he tolerated well, pulling volumes to 800cc. However, he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and tachypnea. He was subsequently placed on volume control and did well. The patient was extubated on [**2-15**], but appeared to have continued respiratory distress throughout the day.

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with an exacerbation of asthma. They have been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 119 bpm and a blood pressure ranging from 134/77 to 95 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a face tent, with a SpO2 of 90%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.53, PaCO2 of 31, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180. The physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds and warm skin. The patient's neurological status is described as attentive, following simple commands, and oriented to self and place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SpO2 of 90% and ABG showing a pH of 7.53 suggest respiratory failure. It is important to monitor and optimize the patient's oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hyperkalemia: The elevated potassium levels (K+ of 5.3 mEq/L) indicate hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the patient's ECG and electrolyte levels is necessary. Treatment options may include calcium gluconate, insulin, and sodium bicarbonate.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of melena ("

   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation.  Rapid viral screen negative at time of presentation.
   Sputum culture positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially
   was treated empirically with Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for
   community-acquired pneumonia, but changed to Levo/Zosyn once
   pseudomonas was speciated.   Ventilatory status has remained stable,
   but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this
   asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid dependent
   asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   Discontinued ASA given potential for bronchospasm.  Theophylline
   discontinued given tachycardia and hypertension.   Extubated [**2-15**],
   appeared to have continued respiratory distress throughout day but no
   significant changes on repeat ABGs.
   - Mini-BAL culture: Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive; on Zosyn
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol nebs
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - Prednisone 60mg daily
 solumedrol while NPO
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily once no longer NPO
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 10 of 14
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CK
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending. ECHO [**2-15**],
   hyperdynamic.
   - Continue statin once no longer NPO
   - d/c'd ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HTN: Has been more increased lately, could be [**1-7**] to agitation but
   does have baseline HTN.
   -          Home Dilt 180mg total daily, holding given NPO
   -          started on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] increase enalapril today
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes.
   -  Adjust free water as indicated; but will try and decrease overall
   volume intake

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of status asthmaticus. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation and requires Bipap for rest. There are concerns about the patient's generalized weakness, which may be due to steroid-induced myopathy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 77 bpm with a range of 77-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/78 mmHg to 192/156 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute with a range of 9-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 94.1 kg and the admission weight was 92.3 kg. The total fluid intake is 2,109 mL with 1,052 mL given intravenously. The total fluid output is 2,465 mL with 655 mL being urine output. There is a negative fluid balance of 356 mL.

The patient is receiving various medications including Levofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Pantoprazole (Protonix), and Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, HCO3- of 123 mEq/L, SaO2 of 97%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 246. The patient's Ve (ventilation efficiency) is 8.8 L/min.

During the physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and not in acute distress. However, the conjunctiva is pale, and the cardiovascular examination reveals normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. The respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion. The skin has not been assessed, and the neurologic examination is incomplete.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 190 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.0 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated lactate level, decreased albumin level, and elevated troponin-T level.

The patient has several medical complications including ventricular tachycardia, depression, electrolyte and fluid disorder, gastrointestinal bleed, and acute respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and has multiple lines including an arterial line, PICC line, and peripheral IV line. Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prevention."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation.  Rapid viral screen negative at time of presentation.
   Sputum culture positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially
   was treated empirically with Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for
   community-acquired pneumonia, but changed to Levo/Zosyn once
   pseudomonas was speciated.   Ventilatory status has remained stable,
   but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this
   asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid dependent
   asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   Discontinued ASA given potential for bronchospasm.  Theophylline
   discontinued given tachycardia and hypertension.   Extubated [**2-15**],
   appeared to have continued respiratory distress throughout day but no
   significant changes on repeat ABGs.
   - Mini-BAL culture: Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive; on Zosyn
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol nebs
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - Prednisone 60mg daily
 solumedrol 40 while NPO
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily once no longer NPO
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 11 of 14
   - BiPAP 10/8 2-3x/day to rest muscles of respiration
   # Guaiac Positive stools: [**2-17**] noted to have guaiac positive stools
   with associated Hct drop, while being diuresed.  NG lavage clear with
   only very trace black flecks.  Had not had PPI x 2 days since NPO.
   Placed on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
   - Q6H Hct
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&C
   - Consult GI this AM
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CKs
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending. ECHO [**2-15**],
   hyperdynamic.
   - Continue statin once no longer NPO
   - d/c'd ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HTN: Has been more increased lately, could be [**1-7**] to agitation but
   does have baseline HTN.
   -          Home Dilt 180mg total daily, now in IV BID
   -          started on ACE, enalapril IV
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes.
   -          Adjust free water as indicated; but will try and decrease
   overall volume intake
   -          Goal even to 500 negative today
   # FEN:  NPO, OG tube removed during extubation
   -          Maintain Mg>3
   -          Formal S&S eval tomorrow
   -          Concern for for oral intake if truly with GI bleed, consider
   TPN for short term
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 4514**] [**Name (NI) 4515**], wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4516**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure due to a severe asthma exacerbation. The patient was initially treated with antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, but the treatment was changed once pseudomonas was identified. Despite ventilatory support, the patient's condition did not improve, raising concerns for alternative causes of the asthma exacerbation. Mini-BAL revealed PMNs without organisms, indicating a possible non-infectious cause such as PCP. However, the LDH levels were normal, making PCP less likely. The patient was extubated on [**2-15**], but continued to have respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with guaiac positive stools and a drop in Hct, possibly due to GI bleeding. The patient's troponin levels were elevated, suggesting a potential cardiac event, but the CKs were flat and the troponins trended down. An ECHO showed hyperdynamic function. The patient has been placed on IV PPI, and a consult with GI has been requested. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he is currently on IV BID diltiazem and enalapril. His sodium levels were elevated but improved with free water flushes. The patient is NPO and has an OG tube removed during extubation. He will continue to be monitored in the ICU for 24-48"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation.  Rapid viral screen negative at time of presentation.
   Sputum culture positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially
   was treated empirically with Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for
   community-acquired pneumonia, but changed to Levo/Zosyn once
   pseudomonas was speciated.   Ventilatory status has remained stable,
   but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this
   asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid dependent
   asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   Discontinued ASA given potential for bronchospasm.  Theophylline
   discontinued given tachycardia and hypertension.   Extubated [**2-15**],
   appeared to have continued respiratory distress throughout day but no
   significant changes on repeat ABGs.
   - Mini-BAL culture: Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive; on Zosyn
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol nebs
   - goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath
   stacking, pCO2 goal less than 90
   - Prednisone 60mg daily
 solumedrol 40 while NPO
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily once no longer NPO
   - goal magnesium > 3.0
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 12 of 14
   - BiPAP 10/8 2-3x/day to rest muscles of respiration
   # Guaiac Positive stools: [**2-17**] noted to have guaiac positive stools
   with associated Hct drop, while being diuresed.  OG lavage no red
   blood,  only very trace black flecks.  Had not had PPI x 2 days since
   NPO.  Placed on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
   - Q6H Hct
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&C
   - Consult GI this AM
   - NPO
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CKs
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending. ECHO [**2-15**],
   hyperdynamic.
   - Continue statin once no longer NPO
   - d/c'd ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HTN: Has been more increased lately, could be [**1-7**] to agitation but
   does have baseline HTN.
   -          Home Dilt 180mg total daily, now in IV BID
   -          started on ACE, enalapril IV, will decrease dose while
   unstable blood volume
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes.
   -          Adjust free water as indicated; but will try and decrease
   overall volume intake
   -          Goal even to 500 negative today
   # FEN:  NPO, OG tube removed during extubation
   -          Maintain Mg>3
   -          Postpone S&S eval tomorrow
   -          Concern for for oral intake if truly with GI bleed, consider
   TPN for short term

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure due to a severe asthma exacerbation. The initial treatment included ventilatory support and antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, which were later changed to targeted therapy for pseudomonas infection. Despite improvement in ventilatory status, the patient failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of the asthma exacerbation. A mini-balloon lavage revealed the presence of PMNs without any organisms, indicating that it is unlikely to be pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP). The patient underwent a pressure support trial, which initially showed improvement but then worsened with decreased volumes and tachypnea. He was placed on volume control and did well. The patient was extubated but continued to have respiratory distress throughout the day. Repeat ABGs showed no significant changes. 

The patient also has guaiac-positive stools with associated Hct drop while being diuresed, and OG lavage showed only trace black flecks without red blood. He was placed on IV PPI therapy and a consultation with GI was requested. The patient's troponin levels were elevated at admission but have trended down, indicating potential cardiac ischemia. He is currently on IV statin therapy and has been discontinued from ASA due to potential bronchospasm and Theophylline due to tachycardia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of depression, electrolyte and fluid disorders, hyperkalemia, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. They have been diuresed and noted to have melena, with an unremarkable OG lavage. The patient also shows signs of diffuse weakness suspicious for steroid myopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has melena, which indicates an upper gastrointestinal bleed. This can lead to significant blood loss and may require transfusion or surgical intervention if the bleeding does not stop.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is indicated by crackles on the right base of the lungs and a decreased oxygen saturation level. This can progress to severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress, potentially requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium (7.9 mg/dL), which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin, and sodium bicarbonate to stabilize the heart rhythm.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are abnormal, indicating a possible imbalance in their body's fluid and electroly"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

- The patient's hematocrit (HCT) continued to trend down slowly and stabilized at approximately 29%. The plan was to transfuse 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to the progression of dropping HCT, but the family refused.
- The patient is at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and has already had one episode. GI consultation recommended IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and transfusion for HCT <27%, with checking Helicobacter pylori antibody status.
- Steroid dosage was tapered from 40mg to 30mg (Solumedrol).
- Enalapril dosing was decreased.
- The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being NPO (nothing by mouth) status for potential GIB.
- Speech and swallow evaluation is scheduled for Tuesday.
- The patient may need to be discussed for potential discharge to rehab later this week.
- Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, muscle wasting, and inability to stand.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but they have been fluctuating. Blood pressure readings are elevated. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation with a nasal cannula.
- Lab results show low white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
   presents with acute respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma
   exacerbation.  Rapid viral screen negative at time of presentation.
   Sputum culture positive for pan-sensitive pseudomonas.    He initially
   was treated empirically with Ceftriaxone/Axithro as coverage for
   community-acquired pneumonia, but changed to Levo/Zosyn once
   pseudomonas was speciated.   Ventilatory status has remained stable,
   but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this
   asthma exacerbation.  Outpt records indicate hx of steroid dependent
   asthma x years. Although initially did not think he had PCP
   prophylaxis, outside records indicate that he was on Bactrim. Mini-BAL
   [**2-10**] revealed PMNs, no organisms seen. LDH normal, so may not be PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4653**] was negative for organisms, and PCP but has grown out two
   species of GNR concerning for oral flora, awaiting speciation.  [**2-10**] had
   pressure support trial which he initially did well on, pulling volumes
   to 800cc; he then worsened with decreased volumes to 500cc and
   tachypnea; he was then place on volume control and did well.
   Discontinued ASA given potential for bronchospasm.  Theophylline
   discontinued given tachycardia and hypertension.   Extubated [**2-15**],
   appeared to have continued respiratory distress throughout day but no
   significant changes on repeat ABGs.   Goal pH 7.2 to 7.3 with
   permissive hypercapnea to minimize breath stacking, pCO2 goal less than
   90.
   - Mini-BAL culture: Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive; on Zosyn
   - Continue ipratropium q4 hours and albuterol nebs
   - Prednisone 60mg daily
 solumedrol 40 while NPO
   - cont singulair 10 mg daily once no longer NPO
   - continue levo/zosyn, day 13 of 14
   - BiPAP 10/8 2-3x/day to rest muscles of respiration
   # Guaiac Positive stools: [**2-17**] noted to have guaiac positive stools
   with associated Hct drop, while being diuresed.  OG lavage no red
   blood,  only very trace black flecks.  Had not had PPI x 2 days since
   NPO.  Placed on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI consult recommended [**Hospital1 **] PPI, monitor
   Hct.  Stabilized [**2-18**].
   - Q12 Hct
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&C
   - Follow-up GI
   # Demand ischemia:  Troponin elevated at time of admission, but CKs
   flat and troponins trended down.  No longer trending. ECHO [**2-15**],
   hyperdynamic.
   - Continue statin once no longer NPO
   - d/c'd ASA given prolonged status asthmaticus
   # HTN: Has been more increased lately, could be [**1-7**] to agitation but
   does have baseline HTN.
   -          Home Dilt 180mg total daily, now in IV BID
   -          started on ACE, enalapril IV, will decrease dose while
   unstable blood volume
   # HyperNa: Improved with free water flushes.
   -          Adjust free water as indicated; but will try and decrease
   overall volume intake
   -          Goal even to 500 negative today
   # FEN:  NPO, OG tube removed during extubation
   -          Maintain Mg>3
   -          S&S eval today
   -          Given TPN x 1 day [**2-18**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with acute respiratory failure and was initially treated for severe asthma exacerbation. However, his ventilatory status remained stable but failed to improve, raising concerns for alternate causes of this asthma exacerbation.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with severe asthma exacerbation and required mechanical ventilation. Despite initial improvement, his respiratory status remained unstable.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had guaiac-positive stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). An upper gastrointestinal lavage did not reveal any red blood, only trace black flecks. The patient was placed on IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and is being monitored for gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels were elevated at admission, but creatine kinase (CK) levels were flat and troponins trended down. However, they are no longer trending downward, indicating a potential cardiac event. An echocardiogram (echo) showed hyperdynamic function.

4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure has been more elevated lately. It could be attributed to agitation or his baseline condition. He is currently on IV diltiazem and enalapril.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.
- He presented with acute respiratory failure due to a severe asthma exacerbation.
- Initial treatment included ventilation and antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, but the patient failed to improve.
- Mini-BAL revealed PMNs and no organisms, suggesting that it may not be PCP.
- The patient has been on IV PPI due to guaiac positive stools and associated Hct drop.
- Troponin levels were elevated at admission but have trended down.
- The patient has hypertension, which could be related to agitation or baseline HTN.
- He is NPO and receiving TPN.
- The patient's condition has been stable, with no significant changes on repeat ABGs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with severe asthma exacerbation and required ventilation. Although his ventilatory status has remained stable, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if his asthma symptoms worsen.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had guaiac positive stools and a drop in Hct, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been placed on IV PPI to prevent further bleeding.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels were elevated at admission, suggesting cardiac ischemia. However, the CKs are flat, and troponins have trended down. An"

   as outlined above. 64 yo male with asthma admitted with acute
   respiratory failure and status asthmaticus in the setting of
   Pseudomonas PNA. Extubated [**2132-2-15**]. Over the past day, he has not had
   further melana, and his hct has remained unchanged by serial testing.
   Seen by the GI consult team but no intervention indicated currently
   with apparent resolution of GI bleed. Remains profoundly deconditioned,
   and was not deemed safe to take po by Speech Therapy- after discussion
   with wife they appeared to a [**Name (NI) **] for tube feeds.
   On exam, alert, following commands. Lungs with rales at bases,
   occasional scattered rhonchi, fair air movement. CV: RRR Abd: soft,
   nontender, hypoactive bs. Ext bilateral boots, no calf tenderness.
   Appears appropriate for floor transfer. Will complete a 14 day course
   of levaquin/zosyn for Pseudomonas PNA and continue work with PT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of asthma, admitted for acute respiratory failure and status asthmaticus due to Pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient was intubated but was successfully extubated on [**2132-2-15**]. Since then, there have been no further episodes of melena (gastrointestinal bleeding), and the patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have remained stable.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, for which he is currently taking diltiazem and enalapril. He also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which seems to have resolved without any further bleeding episodes. 

The patient's current conditions include ventricular tachycardia, depression, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hyperkalemia (high potassium), acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). 

The plan of care includes continuing with the current antibiotics (levaquin and zosyn) for Pseudomonas pneumonia for a total of 14 days, starting home inhalers, continuing diltiazem, and enalapril for hypertension, and considering an advance diet after a video swallow test. 

The patient has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids since [**2132-2-18**] and has had good glycemic control. He has multiple lines"
