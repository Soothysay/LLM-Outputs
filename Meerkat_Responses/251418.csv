   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9436**] is a 34F with a PMH s/f a demyelinating disorder of unknown
   etiology, admitted to the [**Hospital1 5**] for further work-up.  Now requiring
   MICU transfer for difficulty with extubation s/p brain biopsy.
   .
   #. Difficult extubation- In the OR/PACU the team had trouble weaning
   FiO2, reporting that the patient would become hypoxic, although there
   is no evidence of blood gases during her OR course.  Currently FiO2 is
   weaned to 40%, PEEP is 5, VT 600, and RR 12, with an ABG of
   7.48/41/105/31
   -Will wean propofol, check a RISBE and perform a spontaneous breathing
   trial.
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis: Possibly secondary to post-hypercapnia with
   recent lung collapse.  No other evidence of hydrogen loss
   -Will check a urine chloride
   .
   #. Pleural effusion: Unclear etiology, concerning that it is
   unilateral, would expect bilateral effusions if simply due to volume
   overload.
   -Can consider a diagnostic thoracentesis to r/o infection.
   - responded well to 10mg IV lasix, repeat today
   .
   #. S/p brain biopsy- Head CT post-op with no signs of bleeding.  Neuro
   checks in the PACU have been stable.
   -Contact [**Name (NI) **] re: when to restart heparin (24 vs. 48 hours)
   -Hold heparin for now
   -Neuro checks per neuro [**Doctor First Name 91**] recommendations
   -reduce sedation
   .
   #.Acute blood loss/Anemia: Was found to have psoas
   hematoma/retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoag for PEs. s/p
   transfusion. IR angiogram showed no active extravasation.  Also now s/p
   brain biopsy.  Hematocrit stable 23-25 but will continue to monitor.
   - 2 units active T&C
   - Tranfuse HCT< 21
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   #. Fevers- Work up to date very broad, likely related to underlying
   central process +/- component of pulmonary emboli, Infectious work up
   negative.
   -CIS
   -Holding on abx, ID has signed off
   -Monitor hemodynamics
   .
   #.Pulmonary Embolism: Patient has widespread pulmonary emboli. Heparin
   dced @ 6am for brain biospy today. Neuro has documented that they would
   favor restarting this 48H post biopsy
   -Will confirm with neurosurgery re: when to restart.
   .
   #. Seizure activity: Currently on dilantin and clonazapam.  Goal is to
   keep the dilantin dose minimized, using the BZD to enable this (plan
   per neuro).
   -Continue monitoring dilantin levels on [**11-26**] (recently uptitrated on
   [**11-23**] from 300-->330mg)
   - Continue clonazepam.
   .
   #. Demyelinating d/o [**Name (NI) 9437**] Unclear etiology at this time.  Now off of
   steroids.  Neurology deferring further treament at this time given lack
   of response.
   -F/u brain biopsy results, and neuro recs.
   .
   #.Sinus Tachy: Tachycardia has been persistent, likely multifactorial
   related to fevers, PEs, agitation.
   -Will continue to monitor
   .
   #Tachycardia - Pt has had tachycardia since dx of PE. Somewhat improved
   since d/c of BB.  DDx includes PE, physiologic response to PE,
   infection, less likely an SVT, as HR has been known to jump to 140's to
   160s.  Can easily represent a physiologic response in a pt of her age.
   - continue to follow
   - only temporarily responds to fluids.
   - IV BB if symptomatic or sustained tachycardia > 160s.
   .
   #Hypertension - BP has previously run high.  Currently not on
   antihypertensives.  Will hold off on tx given recent brain biopsy.
   Reassess and restart treatment, with preference to BB given coexisting
   tachycardia.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of an unknown demyelinating disorder, admitted to the hospital for further work-up. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to difficulty with extubation after a brain biopsy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Difficult extubation: The patient had trouble weaning FiO2, reporting that the patient would become hypoxic. This suggests a potential issue with extubation.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an elevated pH and bicarbonate level, indicating possible metabolic alkalosis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a unilateral pleural effusion, which could be due to volume overload or an underlying infection. A diagnostic thoracentesis may be considered to rule out infection.
4. Acute blood loss/anemia: The patient has a history of anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequent transfusion due to a posas hematoma/retroperitoneal bleed. Monitoring hematocrit levels is crucial to ensure stable blood cell count.
5. Fevers: The patient has ongoing fevers despite a negative infectious workup. This may be related to the central nervous system process or pulmonary emboli.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has widespread pulmonary emboli, and the decision regarding when to restart heparin therapy needs to be made in consultation"

It is unclear whether this is causing the unilateral pleural effusion. The plan is to check a urine chloride and consider a diagnostic thoracentesis to rule out infection.

3. Pleural effusion: The etiology of the pleural effusion is unclear, especially since it is unilateral. The patient responded well to 10mg IV lasix, and repeat administration is planned today. A diagnostic thoracentesis may be considered to rule out infection.

4. Post-brain biopsy: The patient underwent a brain biopsy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old woman with chronic demyelinating disease of unclear etiology. She underwent a brain biopsy yesterday and remains intubated overnight. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, agitation with a decrease in sedation, encephalopathy, and has a history of seizures. The patient also has volume overload, anemia, and bilateral pulmonary embolisms. She is planned for extubation once her sedation is reduced.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If extubation is attempted prematurely, she may experience respiratory distress or failure to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Encephalopathy/Chronic Demyelinating Disease/Seizures: The patient has a history of encephalopathy and chronic demyelinating disease with seizures. Post-brain biopsy, there is a risk of recurrent seizures or worsening encephalopathy.
3. Volume Overload: The patient has been diagnosed with volume overload, which can lead to congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or renal dysfunction if not managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may contribute to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue perfusion.
5. Bilateral PEs: The patient has bilateral pulmonary embolisms, which can lead to further respiratory compromise, right heart strain, or even fatal outcomes if not adequately treated with anticoag"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9436**] is a 18F with a PMH s/f a demyelinating disorder of unknown
   etiology, admitted to the [**Hospital1 5**] for further work-up.  Transfered to
   MICU for difficulty with extubation s/p brain biopsy.
   #. Respiratory distress - In the OR/PACU the team had trouble weaning
   FiO2.  Extubated yesterday PM, has been tachypnic to 30s-40s but 100%
   on RA, breathing comfortably
   - continue to monitory
   #. S/p brain biopsy- Head CT post-op with no signs of bleeding.  Neuro
   checks in the PACU have been stable.  No sedation
   -Contact [**Name (NI) **] re: when to restart heparin (24 vs. 48 hours)
   -Hold heparin for now
   -Neuro checks per neuro [**Doctor First Name 91**] recommendations
   #. Pleural effusion: Unclear etiology, concerning that it is
   unilateral, would expect bilateral effusions if simply due to volume
   overload.
   - Can consider a diagnostic thoracentesis to r/o infection.
   - responded well to 10mg IV lasix x1, improved CXR for fluid, no more
   given
   #.Acute blood loss/Anemia: Was found to have psoas
   hematoma/retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoag for PEs. s/p
   transfusion. IR angiogram showed no active extravasation.  Also now s/p
   brain biopsy.  Hematocrit stable 23-25 but will continue to monitor.
   - 2 units active T&C
   - Tranfuse HCT< 21
   - Guaiac stools
   #. Fevers- Work up to date very broad, likely related to underlying
   central process +/- component of pulmonary emboli, Infectious work up
   negative.
   -CIS
   -Holding on abx, ID has signed off
   -Monitor hemodynamics
   # Tachycardia - Pt has had tachycardia since dx of PE. Here in 130s.
   Likely multifactorial from fevers, PE and agitation.
   - continue to follow
   - only temporarily responds to fluids.
   - IV BB if symptomatic or sustained tachycardia > 160s.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Possibly secondary to post-hypercapnia with
   recent lung collapse.  No other evidence of hydrogen loss, UCl 114.
   Bicarb 28.
   #.Pulmonary Embolism: Patient has widespread pulmonary emboli. Heparin
   dced @ 6am for brain biospy today. Neuro has documented that they would
   favor restarting this 48H post biopsy
   -Will confirm with neurosurgery re: when to restart.
   #. Seizure activity: Currently on dilantin and clonazapam.  Goal is to
   keep the dilantin dose minimized, using the BZD to enable this (plan
   per neuro).
   - Continue monitoring dilantin levels on [**11-26**] (recently uptitrated on
   [**11-23**] from 300-->330mg)
   - Continue clonazepam.
   #. Demyelinating d/o [**Name (NI) 9437**] Unclear etiology at this time.  Now off of
   steroids.  Neurology deferring further treatment at this time given
   lack of response.
   -F/u brain biopsy results, and neuro recs.
   # Hypertension - BP has previously run high.  Currently not on
   antihypertensives.  Will hold off on tx given recent brain biopsy.
   Reassess and restart treatment, with preference to BB given coexisting
   tachycardia.
   # FEN: restart TF

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9436**] is a 34F with a PMH s/f a demyelinating disorder of unknown
   etiology, admitted to the [**Hospital1 5**] for further work-up.  Transfered to
   MICU for difficulty with extubation s/p brain biopsy.
   #. Respiratory distress - In the OR/PACU the team had trouble weaning
   FiO2.  Extubated yesterday PM, has been tachypnic to 30s-40s but 100%
   on RA, breathing comfortably
   - continue to monitory
   #. S/p brain biopsy- Head CT post-op with no signs of bleeding.  Neuro
   checks in the PACU have been stable.  No sedation
   -Contact [**Name (NI) **] re: when to restart heparin (24 vs. 48 hours)
   -Hold heparin for now
   -Neuro checks per neuro [**Doctor First Name 91**] recommendations
   #. Pleural effusion: Unclear etiology, concerning that it is
   unilateral, would expect bilateral effusions if simply due to volume
   overload.
   - Can consider a diagnostic thoracentesis to r/o infection.
   - responded well to 10mg IV lasix x1, improved CXR for fluid, no more
   given
   #.Acute blood loss/Anemia: Was found to have psoas
   hematoma/retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoag for PEs. s/p
   transfusion. IR angiogram showed no active extravasation.  Also now s/p
   brain biopsy.  Hematocrit stable 23-25 but will continue to monitor.
   - 2 units active T&C
   - Tranfuse HCT< 21
   - Guaiac stools
   #. Fevers- Work up to date very broad, likely related to underlying
   central process +/- component of pulmonary emboli, Infectious work up
   negative.
   -CIS
   -Holding on abx, ID has signed off
   -Monitor hemodynamics
   # Tachycardia - Pt has had tachycardia since dx of PE. Here in 130s.
   Likely multifactorial from fevers, PE and agitation.
   - continue to follow
   - only temporarily responds to fluids.
   - IV BB if symptomatic or sustained tachycardia > 160s.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Possibly secondary to post-hypercapnia with
   recent lung collapse.  No other evidence of hydrogen loss, UCl 114.
   Bicarb 28.
   #.Pulmonary Embolism: Patient has widespread pulmonary emboli. Heparin
   dced @ 6am for brain biospy today. Neuro has documented that they would
   favor restarting this 48H post biopsy
   -Will confirm with neurosurgery re: when to restart.
   #. Seizure activity: Currently on dilantin and clonazapam.  Goal is to
   keep the dilantin dose minimized, using the BZD to enable this (plan
   per neuro).
   - Continue monitoring dilantin levels on [**11-26**] (recently uptitrated on
   [**11-23**] from 300-->330mg)
   - Continue clonazepam.
   #. Demyelinating d/o [**Name (NI) 9437**] Unclear etiology at this time.  Now off of
   steroids.  Neurology deferring further treament at this time given lack
   of response.
   -F/u brain biopsy results, and neuro recs.
   # Hypertension - BP has previously run high.  Currently not on
   antihypertensives.  Will hold off on tx given recent brain biopsy.
   Reassess and restart treatment, with preference to BB given coexisting
   tachycardia.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of a demyelinating disorder of unknown etiology, admitted to the hospital for further work-up. She was transferred to the MICU for difficulty with extubation after a brain biopsy. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, which was initially seen in the OR/PACU and has since improved with continued monitoring. She underwent a successful extubation yesterday and is tolerating it well with respiratory rates in the 30s-40s but maintaining oxygen saturation in the high 90s. 

She also has a history of a brain biopsy without signs of bleeding, and neuro checks have been stable. Heparin has been held due to the recent brain biopsy, and neuro checks are being performed as recommended by the neurosurgeon. 

The patient has a unilateral pleural effusion, which is concerning for an unclear etiology. A diagnostic thoracentesis may be considered to rule out infection. 

She also has acute blood loss/anemia, previously treated with transfusion and an interventional radiology (IR) angiogram showing no active extravasation. Her hematocrit levels are stable between 23-25%, and she will continue to be monitored. 

The patient has fevers, which are likely related to an underlying central process or component of pulmonary emboli. Her infectious workup is negative, and antibiotics have been held as advised by the infectious disease specialist.

The patient has a history of encephalopathy and unresponsiveness. He is currently on heparin sodium infusion and receiving other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/73 to 143/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's recent events include the placement of a multi-lumen central line and the initiation of invasive ventilation. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for myalgias, hyperglycemia, and a seizure. The patient's physical examination reveals sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and clear breath sounds with a few mid inspiratory crackles. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. The patient's medical history includes immunocompromise due to recent steroid use. The patient's assessment and plan include pulmonary embolism, airway protection, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and fever.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 9436], an 18-year-old female with a history of a demyelinating disorder of unknown etiology, was admitted to the hospital for further work-up. She was transferred to the MICU for difficulty with extubation after a brain biopsy. 

The patient presented with respiratory distress in the OR/PACU, requiring reintubation due to tachypnea. She was extubated yesterday PM but remains tachypnic, breathing comfortably on RA. 

Post-brain biopsy, there were no changes in mental status, and the CT scan was negative for bleed. Heparin was restarted 48 hours post-procedure per neurosurgery. 

The patient also had a pleural effusion of unclear etiology, which responded well to 10 mg IV lasix x1, improving the CXR for fluid. 

Additionally, she had acute blood loss/anemia, likely secondary to a psoas hematoma/retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for pulmonary emboli. She received a transfusion and IR angiogram showed no active extravasation. 

Her hematocrit was stable at 23-25%, but will continue to be monitored. 

The patient also experienced fevers, which are likely related to an underlying central process +/- component of pulmonary emboli. Infectious workup was negative, and abx were held as per ID's recommendation. 

Other issues include tachycardia, metabolic alkalosis, pulmonary embolism, seizure activity, demyelinating disorder, hypertension, and access concerns. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessments include pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory distress, inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), altered mental status (not delirium), alteration in nutrition, electrolyte & fluid disorder, and other conditions. 

The plan includes monitoring respiratory distress, restarting heparin 48 hours post-brain biopsy, addressing pleural effusion, managing acute blood loss/anemia, monitoring tachycardia, treating metabolic alkalosis, managing pulmonary embolism, monitoring seizure activity, following up on demyelinating disorder, managing hypertension, restarting TF, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel reg, and reassessing and restarting treatment for various conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, further deterioration of mental status resulting in coma or brain injury, development of sepsis or septic shock due to untreated infection, worsening anemia leading to cardiovascular collapse, increased risk of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis or recurrent pulmonary embolism, and potential complications related to ongoing anticoagulation therapy, including bleeding."

   Status stable overnight, although her neuro exam fluctuates with clonus
   alternating L and right. She remains less alert than last week.
   Unclear if this is an effect of clonazepam or progression of her
   neurological disease.  Remains on anticoagulation for PE indefinately.
   Fever, tachycardia and tachypnea still seem due to underlying process
   but will recx intermit for spikes in fever.   Given extremely unlikely
   dx of a treatable illness major goal now is discussion of goals of care
   with her family.
