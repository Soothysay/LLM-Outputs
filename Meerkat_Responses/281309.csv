   lesion. If
   clinically indicated would recommend a repeat EGD with repeat biopsy.
   3. Multiple cystic-appearing masses throughout the pancreas of
   uncertain
   etiology but could represent simple pancreatic cysts or side branch
   IPMN and
   would recommend further evaluation with MRCP. At this time possible
   pancreatic divisum anatomy could be further evaluated.
   4. Marked pericholecystic fluid but the gallbladder wall itself is not
   thickened and the gallbladder is not distended. If there is persistent
   clinical concern for cholecystitis would recommend further evaluation
   with
   ultrasound or HIDA scan.
   5. Avid enhancement of the adrenals may be an incidental finding but in
   certain clinical settings can represent hypovolemic state and would
   recommend
   correlation with patient's symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 73 y/o with h/o ocular phempigus, BPH
   found to have liver masses without clear primary cancer at [**Hospital3 **],
   transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for repeat liver bx. Transfered to ICU for
   hypotension, tachypnea, and presistent fevers
   #  Liver Mass: Per wet red of US liver there is extensive replacement
   of liver parenchyma with nodules suspicious for tumor. No sign of
   abcess. No biliary dilation. Previous infectious work up at [**Hospital3 **]
   also negative. Fevers most likely [**3-11**] tumor. WBC of 15 on presentation
   10 days ago without consistent abx therapy also reassuring against
   infectious etiology. NL AFP and number of nodules suggestive against
   primary hepatic ca, however bx too necrotic to rule this out. In
   addition elevated ferritin and greek ethnicity reaising possbile
   hemachromatosis. W/u to date with EGD, MRCP, CT chest, head, EGD, bone
   scan witout sign of primary oncologic process. Rapid worsening of LFTs,
   LDH, and abd pain since admission to [**Hospital3 **] in setting of
   discontinuing steroids concerning for Lymphoma. Elevattion of tbili /
   alk phos likely [**3-11**] mass effect on biliary tree from numerous lesions.

   for adrenal insufficiency, however am Cortisol 26.5
   - f/u prelim of Bone bx
   - Heme onc recs
   - hepatology recs
   - Given elevated INR, recent US liver bx, potential to avoid need liver
   bx with bone marrow bx, and inability to process specimen today will
   hold of on Liver bx. If bone marrow bx prelim without info and CT abd
   worse will attempt IR liver bx on weekend
   - trend K, phos, ca, uric acid, LDH for signs of tumor lysis [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTS
   - given drastic increase in LFTS get urgent CT abd/pelvis
   - hold abx for now
   - get [**Hospital3 **] imaging
   - If decompensates consider 40mg IV decadron daily for presumptive
   lymphoma (heme/onc recs)
   .
   #  Abd pain, nausea: RUQ pain likely [**3-11**] extensive tumor invastion and
   hepatitis. Fever, RUQ, and elevated tibil raises concern for
   cholangitis, however chronicity of fevers and stable white count, lack
   of evidence on limited RUQ  USmakes this unlikely
   - serial abd exam
   - trend LFTs
   - abd imaging
   - MSIV
   - avoid excessive Tylenol
   - hepatitis serologies
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ddx including infection vs hematologic malignancy vs
   adrenal insufficency. In setting fever, of tachycardia, relative
   hypotension concerning for infection / shock. However chronicity over
   last 10 days without presistent abx making infection less likely. Neg
   infectious w/u at [**Hospital3 **] and lack of infection on path also
   reassuring. AM cortisol of 26 makes adrenal insufficiency unlikely.
   Most likely [**3-11**] malignancy. Elevated lactate likely [**3-11**] necrotic
   tissue.
   - hold abx, consider starting if VS become unstable

   comfortable. Likely splinting 2.2 rib and RUQ pain
   - CXR to eval for pleural effusion / PNA
   - ABG with lactate
   - LENIs
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na of 127. (128-130 throughout [**Hospital3 **] stay). Given
   dry mucous membranes, elevated BUN, likely represents intravascular
   volume depletion despite LE edema.
   - serum osm, U osm and NA
   - NS IVF for now
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 28 at [**Hospital1 **]. Required 4 u pRBC at [**Hospital3 **], also
   guiac postitive stool, but no fank bleed. Given additional illness
   anemia of chronic disease also likely contributing.
   - trend HCT
   .
   # Asymetric LE edema: edema likely [**3-11**] hypoalbumenia and possible
   increase in portal hypotension. However, asymetric and in setting of
   tachypnea and cancer PE also possible

   Disposition: ICU pending above
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current symptoms, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers without a clear source. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of these fevers.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which may be due to respiratory issues such as pneumonia or pleural effusion.

3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), hepatic (liver): The patient has liver masses that are suspicious for tumor, but the primary cancer has not been identified yet. A repeat liver biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential volume depletion or infection. Intravenous fluids and close monitoring are necessary to manage this condition.

5. Atelectasis: The patient has right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, which may be causing breathing difficulties.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion and possible adrenal insufficiency.

7. Anemia: The patient is anemic, likely due to chronic disease, blood loss, or nutritional deficiencies.

8. Asymmetric lower extremity edema: The patient has swelling in one leg more than the other, which could be caused by hypoalbuminemia, increased"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was initially admitted to Hospital3 for liver masses without clear primary cancer and later transferred to Hospital1 due to hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 101/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a history of ocular pemphigus, BPH, and previous infectious workup at Hospital3, which was negative. 

Laboratory findings show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15, elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, AP), elevated ferritin, and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT, INR). Imaging studies reveal numerous hyperechoic liver masses amenable to ultrasound-guided targeted liver biopsy, suggesting possible metastatic foci or multifocal primary tumors. Other findings include marked pericholecystic fluid, avid enhancement of the adrenals, right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, and small areas of consolidation. 

The patient's assessment and plan include fever of unknown origin, hypoxemia, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and hypotension (not shock)."

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was admitted to the hospital due to liver masses without a clear primary cancer. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, hypotension, and tachypnea. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, which may be indicative of an underlying infection or malignancy.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be caused by various factors such as respiratory infections, lung involvement in cancer, or other pulmonary complications.
3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Hepatic (Liver): The patient has liver masses suspicious for tumor, with no clear primary cancer identified. Further evaluation and biopsy are needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.
4. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can be attributed to volume depletion, sepsis, or other causes. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Right Pleural Effusion with Adjacent Atelectasis: The patient has a right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, indicating a potential complication related to lung involvement or fluid accumulation in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was admitted to the hospital due to liver masses without clear primary cancer, and his condition has rapidly worsened since admission. The patient's fever, hypoxemia, and hypotension suggest a possible infection or malignancy. He also has anemia, hyponatremia, and asymmetric lower extremity edema. Imaging studies show numerous liver masses with central necrosis, an enlarged liver, and right pleural effusion. There is also a marked pericholecystic fluid without gallbladder wall thickening. The patient's lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin levels. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever, elevated white blood cell count, and lack of consistent antibiotic therapy raise concerns for an ongoing infection.
2. Malignancy: The extensive replacement of liver parenchyma with nodules suspicious for tumor, elevated LDH, and negative infectious work-up suggest the possibility of malignancy.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The concern for adrenal insufficiency is raised due to the patient's relative hypotension, tachycardia, and withdrawal of steroids.
4. Cholangitis: The combination of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, fever, and"

   1. Innumerable peripheral enhancing with apparent central necrosis
   masses
   distributed throughout the right and left lobes of the liver. The liver
   itself is enlarged. Differential includes metastatic foci or less
   likely
   multifocal primary tumors. Multifocal abscess is much less likely on
   the
   differential.
   2. Abnormal appearance to the gastric mucosa may represent a mass
   lesion. If
   clinically indicated would recommend a repeat EGD with repeat biopsy.
   3. Multiple cystic-appearing masses throughout the pancreas of
   uncertain
   etiology but could represent simple pancreatic cysts or side branch
   IPMN and
   would recommend further evaluation with MRCP. At this time possible
   pancreatic divisum anatomy could be further evaluated.
   4. Marked pericholecystic fluid but the gallbladder wall itself is not
   thickened and the gallbladder is not distended. If there is persistent
   clinical concern for cholecystitis would recommend further evaluation
   with
   ultrasound or HIDA scan.
   5. Avid enhancement of the adrenals may be an incidental finding but in
   certain clinical settings can represent hypovolemic state and would
   recommend
   correlation with patient's symptoms.

   consolidation cannot be fully excluded.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and ocular pemphigus, currently being treated with methotrexate and prednisone. He was transferred from another hospital due to poor appetite and multiple liver lesions seen on CT scan. The patient also has malignant cells found in a US-guided biopsy, but further determination could not be made. His CA 19-9 level is mildly elevated, while other markers are negative. There is no involvement of the head and chest CT. An EGD showed friable tissue in the stomach but negative biopsies. The patient has persistently febrile episodes, and steroids have been tapered. He was transferred from the floor due to tachycardia and slightly low blood pressure. A bone marrow biopsy was performed due to concern of lymphoma, with worsening liver function tests off steroids. The touch prep did not show obvious malignancy, and a liver biopsy has not been done yet due to an elevated INR of 1.9.

The patient's overnight course included continued abdominal discomfort. The 24-hour events mentioned an abdominal ultrasound, nasal swab, EKG, and fever of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's medical history, allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other ICU medications are documented. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and ocular pemphigus, currently being treated with methotrexate (MTX) and prednisone. He was admitted to the hospital due to poor appetite, multiple liver lesions on CT scan, and malignant cells found in a US-guided biopsy of one lesion. His CA 19-9 level is mildly elevated, while other markers are negative. He also has friable tissue in the stomach but negative biopsies from an EGD procedure. The patient has persistently high fevers and has been febrile since admission. Steroids have been tapered, and he has been transferred from the floor to the ICU due to tachycardia and slightly low blood pressure.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to aspirin and unknown medications. He has received various infusions and medications, including morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and omeprazole. There are no changes to his medical and family history or review of systems.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs with a maximum temperature of 101.7°F (38.7°C) and current temperature of 97.3°F (36.3°C). His heart rate is 106 bpm with a range of 82-119 bpm, blood pressure is 99/63 mmHg, respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of gastric carcinoma with liver metastases. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers. The patient's medical history includes ocular pemphigus and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He has undergone several medical interventions and is receiving various medications, including omeprazole (for stress ulcer prophylaxis), morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium (for DVT prophylaxis).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA): The patient has persistent fevers, which could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory condition.
2. HYPOXEMIA: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 95%, indicating mild hypoxemia. This may be due to respiratory issues such as atelectasis or pneumonia.
3. CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER): The patient has liver metastases from gastric carcinoma. This indicates advanced disease and potential complications related to liver function.
4. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, suggesting ongoing hypotension. This could be due to volume depletion or medication effects.
5. ABDOminal PAIN, NAUSEA: The patient has improved symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea, which may be"

He has been receiving treatment for various conditions including leukocytosis, low urine output, abdominal pain, nausea, tachycardia, relative hypotension, and tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA): The patient has persistent fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
2. HYPOXEMIA: The patient's oxygen saturation level is slightly low, indicating inadequate oxygenation of the blood.
3. CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER): The patient has liver metastases from gastric carcinoma, which could lead to liver dysfunction and associated complications.
4. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can result in inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
5. LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an infection or inflammatory process.
6. LOW UROFLUID OUTPUT: The patient's urine output is low, which may indicate dehydration, urinary tract obstruction,"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and found to have liver masses without a clear primary cancer at another hospital. He was transferred to this hospital for repeat liver biopsy. Upon arrival, he was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with gastric carcinoma with liver metastases.

Potential medical complications:

1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers, and the source of infection has not yet been identified. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and conduct further investigations to determine the cause.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood. This can be due to various factors such as respiratory issues or compromised lung function. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and providing appropriate respiratory support if needed.

3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), hepatic (liver): The patient has liver metastases from gastric carcinoma. Ongoing assessment and management of the cancer, including palliative care, should be considered.

4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient is experiencing low blood pressure. This may be due to intravascular volume depletion, as indicated by poor oral intake and low albumin levels. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is essential.

5. Leukocytosis: The"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus and benign prostatic hyperplasia who was found to have liver masses without a clear primary cancer at another hospital. He was transferred to the current hospital for a repeat liver biopsy. Upon admission, he presented with hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers. 

The patient has been diagnosed with gastric carcinoma with liver metastases. His vital signs indicate a fever (Tmax: 37.9°C or 100.3°F, Tcurrent: 36.9°C or 98.5°F), tachycardia (HR: 105 bpm), hypotension (BP: 92/59 mmHg), and hypoxemia (SpO2: 95%). 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis (WBC: 18.2), thrombocytopenia (Plt: 154), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 127/539), altered kidney function (Cr: 1.2), and anemia (Hct: 26.0).

- The patient is a 78-year-old male with ocular pemphigoid.
- He was admitted with weakness and fevers, presumed to be from a malignancy, possibly lymphoma or gastric cancer.
- The patient has multiple liver metastases and a concern for primary gastric cancer.
- He required fluid resuscitation for low urine output but is still refusing a Foley catheter.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/62 mmHg to 112/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals scattered rales at the bases of the lungs, soft and tender abdomen, and peripheral edema.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with low albumin and elevated liver enzymes.
- Imaging studies reveal a cystic mass in the pancreas, right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, and bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis without evidence of pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin, hypoxemia, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the liver, and hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and gastric carcinoma with liver metastasis.
- The patient was admitted to the hospital for hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers.
- He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), tachycardia, pain control, fever of unknown origin (FUO), hypoxemia, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the liver, and hypotension.
- The patient underwent a liver biopsy today due to elevated INR, and FFP was given for the procedure.
- Other assessments and plans include leukocytosis, low urine output, abdominal pain, nausea, RUQ pain, hyponatremia, anemia, asymmetric left lower extremity edema, and ocular pemphigus.
- The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with trends in various laboratory values and serial abdominal exams.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia and is on antibiotics. There is a risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Bleeding: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a higher risk of bleeding. This is particularly concerning given the recent liver biopsy procedure.
3. Organ failure: The patient has evidence of liver failure, as indicated by abnormal"

He presented to the hospital with hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP): The patient has been diagnosed with CAP, which is a lung infection commonly seen in individuals who are hospitalized or have recently been discharged from the hospital. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient's response to treatment.

2. Tachycardia, other: The patient is experiencing an elevated heart rate. This could be due to various reasons such as fever, hypotension, or intravascular volume depletion. Monitoring the patient's vital signs and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation will be important.

3. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia): The patient has had persistent fevers despite receiving antibiotics. Further investigations are required to identify the cause of the fever, which may include bloodstream infection, urinary tract infection, or other sources of infection.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood. This can be due to respiratory issues such as pneumonia or underlying lung disease. Ensuring adequate oxygenation through supplemental oxygen and"

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular cavity sizes
   with preserved global biventricular systolic function.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, for which he has been started on vancomycin and cefipime.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which could be due to fever, hypotension, or volume depletion.
4. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, and his pain control has been increased to oxycodone 10mg po q4h.
5. Peripheral edema: The patient has significant peripheral edema, which is likely due to intravascular volume overload and hypoalbuminemia.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, and he has been started on vancomycin and cefipime for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
7. Low urine output: The patient's low urine output could be due to enlarged prostate or hepatorenal"

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular cavity sizes
   with preserved global biventricular systolic function.

   -oxycodone 5-10mg prn for breakthrough
   # Renal failure: unclear etiology at this point, not BPH as has foley
   in, his urine lytes have responded to IVF recently suggesting component
   of intravascular depletion with overall volume overload
   -hepato-renal failure is possibility (if so would need midodrine and
   octeotride); IAH unlikely, U/S rules out ureteral obstruction
   -sending tumor lysis labs because of concern of elevated Uric Acid and
   its potential to accumulate in the kidneys
   -continue with fluid resuscitation; one more unit PRBC today, then
   recheck Hct and lytes

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was initially found to have liver masses without a clear primary cancer at [**Hospital3**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1**] for a repeat liver biopsy. He was then transferred to the ICU for hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal failure, acute: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. He is receiving IV fluids and will need further evaluation and management.
2. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which may indicate CAP. Antibiotics have been started, and further monitoring is needed.
3. Tachycardia, other: The patient has an elevated heart rate, likely due to fever and intravascular volume depletion.
4. Pain control: The patient's pain is uncontrolled, and he has been started on oxycontin SR and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient has low oxygen saturation levels, which may be due to tachypnea and splinting.
6. Cancer, hepatic (liver): The patient has liver masses, possibly secondary to gastric carcinoma. Biopsies will be followed up, and hepatology consultation will be sought.

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular cavity sizes
   with preserved global biventricular systolic function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was found to have liver masses without a clear primary cancer at Hospital3 and was transferred to Hospital1 for a repeat liver biopsy. He was then transferred to the ICU for hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to intravascular volume depletion with overall volume overload. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to fever and intravascular volume depletion.
4. Pain Control: The patient's pain is currently uncontrolled, and he has been started on oxycontin SR 30mg PO BID and oxycodone 5-10mg prn for breakthrough pain.
5. Low Urine Output: The patient has low urine output, which could be related to an enlarged prostate or hepato-renal syndrome. A renal ultrasound is pending, and the patient's creatinine levels will be closely monitored.
6. Abdominal Pain and Nausea: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea have improved, but he still experiences RUQ pain, likely due to"

   Echocardiogram:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular cavity sizes
   with preserved global biventricular systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 73 y/o with h/o ocular phempigus, BPH
   found to have liver masses without clear primary cancer at [**Hospital3 **],
   transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for repeat liver bx. Transfered to ICU for
   hypotension, tachypnea, and presistent fevers
   #  Gastric carcinoma w/ liver mets
   - f/u prelim of Bone bx
   - Heme onc following
   - hepatology following
   - Given elevated INR, will likely need FFP if having a procedure.
   - trend K, phos, ca, uric acid, LDH, LFTS, lactate
   - f/u read on liver bx, and depending on results, address possibility
   of CMO vs continuing with treatment with other teams and family.
   # pain control: currently uncontrolled
   -start oxycontin SR 30mg PO BID
   -oxycodone 5-10mg prn for breakthrough
   # Renal failure: unclear etiology at this point, not BPH as has foley
   in, his urine lytes have responded to IVF recently suggesting component
   of intravascular depletion with overall volume overload
   -hepato-renal failure is possibility (if so would need midodrine and
   octeotride); IAH unlikely, U/S rules out ureteral obstruction
   -sending tumor lysis labs because of concern of elevated Uric Acid and
   its potential to accumulate in the kidneys
   -continue with fluid resuscitation; one more unit PRBC today, then
   recheck Hct and lytes
   #Leukocytosis:
   - Started Vanc/Cefipime for HAP D1 [**8-25**]; Cefepime to Q24H because of
   renal function, Also on Cipro  for extended negative coverage for D1
   [**8-25**] for HAP; though based on WBC and fevers, not CXR
   - Watch WBC
   -check CXR.  Unless totally clear, complete 8days antibiotics, then
   d/c.
   -Vanco trough before dose today
   #  Liver failure: likely secondary to metastatic disease
   - f/u biopsies
   - serial abd exam
   - trend LFTs
   - avoid excessive Tylenol
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, HCV negative
   # tachycardia / relative hypotension: BP, HR appears close to VS at
   [**Hospital3 **]. Likely [**3-11**] to fevers and intravascular volume depletion
   (given poor PO intake and low alb).
   - trend VS
   - IVF as needed since both have been responded to IVF
   # Tachypneia: pt taking swallow breaths but sating well and appears
   comfortable. Likely splinting 2.2 rib and RUQ pain
   - CXR showed no pleural effusion but elevated diaphragm likely [**3-11**]
   large liver
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26 at [**Hospital1 **]. Required 4 u pRBC at [**Hospital3 **], also
   guiac postitive stool, but no frank bleed. Given additional illness
   anemia of chronic disease also likely contributing.
   - trend HCT
   - 2U PRBC this am
   -u/s to r/o  pericapsular hematoma given yesterday
s liver bx
   #  Ocular pemphigus. No active concerns.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of ocular pemphigus and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was found to have liver masses without a clear primary cancer at [Hospital3], transferred to [Hospital1] for a repeat liver biopsy. The patient was then transferred to the ICU for hypotension, tachypnea, and persistent fevers.

The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, bacterial pneumonia, tachycardia, pain control issues, fever of unknown origin, hypoxemia, cancer (hepatic metastasis), and hypotension. 

Assessment and plan include addressing the patient's pain control by starting oxycontin SR 30mg PO BID and oxycodone 5-10mg prn for breakthrough pain. Renal failure is also a concern, with unclear etiology, but possibly related to hepatorenal syndrome or volume overload. 

Leukocytosis has been addressed with antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, and liver failure is suspected to be secondary to metastatic disease. The patient's tachycardia and relative hypotension are likely due to fevers and intravascular volume depletion. Tachypnea may be caused by rib pain and RUQ discomfort. Anemia is present, possibly due to chronic disease or occult bleeding.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical"
