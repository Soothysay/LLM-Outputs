   have hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for
   sepsis.

   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with tachypnea,
   hypotension, and elevated lactate. Most likely source is the HD
   catheter which, on exam was red and tender. This AM blood cultures
   taken  in ED grew out GPC in clusters. Urine culture is pending. CXR
   was unimpressive but will repeat for assessment.
   - Continue IV fluids with goal CVP 8-12, if needed start levophed to
   maintain MAP>65
   -will contact IR to pull HD tunnel line and replace on Mon/Tues
   - HD today
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.

   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), metastatic renal cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for sepsis. The patient met SIRS criteria with tachypnea, hypotension, and elevated lactate. The likely source of infection is the HD catheter, which was red and tender. Blood cultures taken in the emergency department grew out gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters. Urine culture is pending. A chest X-ray was unimpressive but will be repeated for assessment.

The patient has multiple medical complications including thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), stage V kidney failure on HD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right-sided weakness, and fecal incontinence.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, along with the presence of a red and tender HD catheter, suggests sepsis. The blood cultures growing GPC in clusters further supports this diagnosis.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue and found to
   have hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for
   sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with tachypnea,
   hypotension, and elevated lactate. Most likely source is the HD
   catheter which, on exam was red and tender. This AM blood cultures
   taken  in ED grew out GPC in clusters. Urine culture is pending. CXR
   was unimpressive but will repeat for assessment.
   - Continue IV fluids with goal CVP 8-12, if needed start levophed to
   maintain MAP>65
   -will contact IR to pull HD tunnel line and replace on Mon/Tues
   - HD today
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   - f/u renal recs today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          f/u renal for recommendations
   -          heparin Ab labs
   .
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled.
   -          holding beta blocker until after HD then reassess
   -          hold anticoagulation
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Will hold both until
   hypotension is under control and thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - as above
   .
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if
   necessary (however will hold while he is getting HD).
   -optimize electrolytes
   - strict I/O
   -reassess I/O goals post HD as may continue to be hypotensive
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: Renal service following. Will contact
   IR to remove tunnel line and replace given likely infection nidus.
   -          HD this am
   -          -f/u electrolytes
   .
   # COPD: ? restrictive physiology on PFTs in [**2117**]. Currently patient is
   asymptomatic. There is question of OSA as well but patient refused CPAP
   overnight.
   - cont Tiotropium, albuterol prn
   - sleep consult
   .
   # History of CVA in [**2117**] with R sided weakness:
   -will continue to hold ASA at this time until thrombocytopenia is fully
   worked up
   -monitor BP
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, check electrolytes post-HD, replete as needed
   .
   # PPX: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots, hold heparin and ASA for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), metastatic renal cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities. The patient presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, which are concerning for sepsis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F (38.5°C), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/59 mmHg to 128/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial flutter with a regular rhythm.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage V on HD and has an atriovenous (AV) fistula for dialysis. The AV fistula is red and tender, indicating possible infection. Blood cultures taken in the emergency department grew out Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters, suggesting a bacterial infection. Urine culture results are pending.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, elevated lactate, and fever is consistent with sepsis. The most likely source of infection is the HD catheter, which is red and tender. Blood cultures have grown GPC"

   hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachypnea, hypotension, and
   elevated lactate. Likely source is pulmonary vs. HD catheter-associated
   line infection vs. urosepsis. PE findings of erythema at HD catheter
   site and tenderness extremely concerning. UA with WBCs but neg
   LE/nitrates. CXR unimpressive.
   - Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc QHD, given history of ESBL,
   will cover with meropenem awaiting cultures
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, sent cultures off both HD catheter
   line ports
   - obtain sputum if possible
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - repeat CXR in am
   - discuss with renal removal of HD line
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:Slightly off baseline at 92 on admission with INR at
   baseline of 1.3.
   - check DIC labs
   .
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled.
   - hold standing BB in setting of hypotension, will treat if becomes
   tachycardic overnight
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.
   - hold aspirin pending improvement in platelets
   - hold beta blocker until hypotension resolved
   .
   # CHF: Known diastolic dysfunction. EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**] on admission.
   Mild evidence of CHF on exam.  No acute indication for HD
   - will monitor with volume resuscitation, will try IV lasix overnight
   if acutely decompensates, then call renal for emergent HD
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: On T/T/S schedule. No acute indication
   for HD.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with h/o A-fib and ESRD now on HD via catheter and admit
   with malaise and fatigue with febrile illness all concerning for
   catheter related infection.  He has required fluid bolus and with that
   has improved MAP and pressors have not been required.
   1)Sepsis-Concerning for catheter related blood stream infection which
   is well supported by blood culture results to date.  He has had
   improved hemodynamics with IVF bolus but has remained febrile within
   the last 24 hours.
   -Vanco/Levofloxacin
   -F/U blood culture
   -Would favor line change given sepsis and positive blood cultures but
   will have to be considered with Renal Team
   -IVF bolus as needed
   2)Hypoxemia--He does have sepsis as described above and is certainly at
   risk for non-cardigenic edema and acute lung injury.  In addition to
   this he does have clear witnessed aspiration event overnight as
   possible additional insult contributing to hypoxemia.
   2.5)Thrombocytopenia
Patient 200 at previous admission and now at 50.
   Will need clarification of heparin exposure to consider possible
   sources.
   -Check smear for possible clumping
   -Check of DIC labs
   -Will need to consider HIT if heparin exposure documented
no evidence
   of thombosis
   3)End Stage Renal Disease--
   -Will continue with dialysis as hemodynamics stabilized
   -Nephrocaps
   -Will need to discuss line change with renal

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/anxious individual who presented with fever and chills. They have undergone hemodialysis (HD) and had their dialysis catheter removed due to complications. The patient experienced rigors and shivering after the removal of the line, which resulted in dropped pressures and low central venous O2 saturation. They were given 2 liters of normal saline, which helped improve their blood pressure. The patient has been started on meropenem for Proteus infection, which is resistant to other antibiotics. They have no known drug allergies. The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged from admission. Review of systems is unchanged except as noted below.

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F) and current temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 94 bpm with a range of 86-135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 68-126/33-98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute with a range of 18-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 20 mmHg with a range of 14-23 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates total input of 4,399 mL with an output of 1,280 mL by mouth, 3,119 mL of intravenous fluids, and 505 mL of urine output. Blood products and drains are not mentioned. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 85% and an ABG result of ///23/. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, overweight/obese, anxious, pale conjunctiva, normal cardiovascular system, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) count. Creatinine (Cr) level is elevated, while troponin-T is within normal limits. Glucose level is within normal limits, but other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, differential leukocyte count, lactic acid, albumin, LDH, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels are within normal or abnormal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP). Code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is pending further evaluation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), metastatic renal cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, and previous myocardial infarction (CAD). He presented with fatigue and was found to have hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, concerning for sepsis. The patient had rigors and chills after his dialysis line was pulled, indicating a possible infection. He is currently on vancomycin and levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of rigors, chills, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis. The growing Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters in his blood and Proteus in his urine indicate a bacterial infection that needs to be addressed promptly.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been progressively decreasing since last month, reaching a baseline of 92 on admission. This could be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or other causes such as viral infection or drug reactions.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which is currently being rate-controlled. However, beta"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, who
   presented with fatigue and found to have hypotension, elevated lactate,
   and tachypnea concerning for sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 Patient had rigors and chills after line was pulled
   yesterday. Did not respond to tylenol or ibuprofen. Mild improvement
   with fentanyl. Growing GPC in clusters in blood and proteus in urine.
   Currently on vancomycin per HD protocol and levofloxacin q48 hours. CVP
   of 12, HCT stable. Patient seems stable now, but was in septic [**Last Name (un) 5486**]
   last night. His response was very fast and with small ammount of fluid.
   However, fluids may be problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] on him since there is no HD access
   for now. The most likely source for indection was the HD line, and the
   fact that patient rigored after it was pulled strengthens the evidence.
   There is question of PNA on CXR, but it is not impressive.
   - Continue IV fluids with goal CVP 12-16, if still hypotensive can give
   RBCs and check central SVO2; and if needed start levophed to maintain
   MAP>65
   - If patient unstable, we will broaden coverage to include pseudomonas
   and posibly ESBL bacteria given patient E coli, proteus and multiple
   antibiotics treatments in the past
   - will contact IR to put HD tunnel line and replace on Mon or temporal
   line depending on cultures
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return and sensitivities to proteus
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   - f/u renal recs today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          f/u renal for recommendations
   -          heparin Ab labs
   -          Transfuse plts if <20,000
   .
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled. CHADS2 2+
   -          holding beta blocker until after HD then reassess
   -          hold anticoagulation
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Will hold both until
   hypotension is under control and thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - as above
   .
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if
   necessary, but not likely due to septic physiology now.
   -optimize electrolytes
   - strict I/O
   -reassess I/O goals post HD as may continue to be hypotensive
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: Renal service following.
          -      HD Monday
   -          -f/u electrolytes
   .
   # COPD: ? restrictive physiology on PFTs in [**2117**]. Currently patient is
   asymptomatic. There is question of OSA as well but patient refused CPAP
   overnight.
   - cont Tiotropium, albuterol prn
   - sleep consult
   .
   # History of CVA in [**2117**] with R sided weakness:
   -will continue to hold ASA at this time until thrombocytopenia is fully
   worked up
   -monitor BP
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, check electrolytes post-HD, replete as needed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), who presented with fatigue and hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea concerning for sepsis. The patient experienced rigors and chills after the removal of his dialysis catheter and had a positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters and proteus in urine.

The patient is currently on vancomycin per HD protocol and levofloxacin every 48 hours. His central venous pressure (CVP) is at 12, and he appears stable now but was in septic shock last night. The most likely source of infection is the HD line, as the patient rigorously responded after it was pulled.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, chills, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea suggests sepsis. The source of infection is likely the HD line, but other potential sources should be considered.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing progressively since last month, which could be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), drug-induced reaction, or other causes.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, who
   presented with fatigue and found to have hypotension, elevated lactate,
   and tachypnea with likely HD line sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis
 Patient with gram + cocci in clusters growing from HD line
   as well as from the blood in multiple cultures which is not yet
   speciated.  second culture grew through vancomycin. Patient had rigors
   and chills after line was pulled, which did not respond to tylenol or
   ibuprofen. Mild improvement with fentanyl. Also with proteus in urine.
   Currently on vancomycin per HD protocol and levofloxacin q48 hours. HCT
   stable, BP stable. There is question of PNA on CXR, but it is not
   impressive.
   - hold on additional IV fluids for now, goal CVP 12-16
   - If patient unstable, we will broaden coverage to include pseudomonas
   and posibly ESBL bacteria given patient E coli, proteus and multiple
   antibiotics treatments in the past
   - will contact IR to put temporal line for monday given that cultures
   are still positive and cannot have new tunnel line
   - given GPC is likely source would continue vancomycin
   - continue levofloxacin until remainder of blood and urine cultures
   return and sensitivities to proteus
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, lactate.
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - f/u sputum cx if any could be obtained
   # Thrombocytopenia: At baseline 92 on admission. DIC labs are normal.
   At this point would also consider heparin induced thrombocytopenia
   (progressive decrease of plt count since last month at 200s). Could
   also be secondary to HD itself, viral infection, or other drug induced
   reaction. Given patients meds heparin seems the most likely source.
   -          heparin Ab labs still pending
   - hold subQ heparin, use pneumoboots instead
   -          Transfuse plts if <10 or if < 50, 000 with signs of active
   bleeding
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently rate controlled. CHADS2 2+
   -          restarted home better blocker yesterday afternoon
   -          would consider that this patient may benefit from
   anticoagulation for afib long term
   # CAD: s/p MI.   On aspirin, beta blocker at home. Holding aspirin
   until thrombocytopenia workup is complete.
   - hold ASA
   - restarted b-blocker [**9-8**]
   # CHF: EF 60%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 3911**]. Will monitor I/O closely, HD and lasix if
   necessary, but not likely due to septic physiology now.
   -optimize electrolytes
   - goal while off HD to keep electrolytes even
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: Renal service following.
   -      HD Monday, follow electrolytes
   -          -f/u electrolytes
   # COPD: ? restrictive physiology on PFTs in [**2117**]. Currently patient is
   asymptomatic. There is question of OSA as well but patient refused CPAP
   overnight.
   - patient continues to refuse CPAP in house, will d/c order for it now
   - patient refuses nebs
   # History of CVA in [**2117**] with R sided weakness:
   -will continue to hold ASA at this time until thrombocytopenia is fully
   worked up
   -monitor BP

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and a past myocardial infarction (CAD). He presented with fatigue, hypotension, elevated lactate, and tachypnea, likely due to HD line sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a fever, wheezing, and decreased oxygen saturation. His blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is not yet speciated. The patient has also been found to have Proteus in his urine. He is currently on vancomycin per HD protocol and levofloxacin every 48 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's HD line is infected, leading to sepsis. The infection is caused by gram-positive cocci in clusters, which has not been speciated yet. The patient has already shown signs of infection, such as rigors and chills after the line was pulled, and he is still experiencing mild improvement with fentanyl. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary if the patient becomes unstable or if cultures show resistance to current medications.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to various reasons such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, viral infection, or drug reactions. Further investigation is"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD who presented with
   fatigue found to be hypotensive with MRSA HD catheter-associated sepsis
   and proteus UTI initially improved by now with AMS and desat.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Desat - 7L+ LOS in patient with underlying diastolic dysfunction on
   HD. Much of this hypoxia is likely [**1-20**] refractory pulmonary edema/fluid
   overload in setting of removal of HD line as well as fluid
   recessutation for hypotension. Other possibilites include PE,
   aspiration pneumonitis vs pna. Currently, sats are in high 90s on
   non-rebreather.
   - aggressive diuresis diuril 500mg IV and lasix 100mg IV
   - maintain sats >90%
   - renal to touch base with IR re: HD line placement for HD today
   .
   #. AMS - Per chart review, the patient's baseline mental status is
   somewhat poor although his current state seems somewhat worse than his
   baseline.  This could likely be acute delirium superimposed on chronic
   dementia [**1-20**] hypoxia along with both his line infection and UTI. Other
   reasons for his AMS include: meds (ativan, abx), metabolic
   abnormalities, new or untreated infection, inctracranial pathology
   including hemorrhage. Would like to avoid head CT and/or LP as this
   patient has several conditions that explain his AMS and CT and LP would
   require sedation likely to the point of intubation, thereby exposing
   the patient to increased risks assoc with his care with likely low
   yield.
   - haldol 0.5-2 prn agitation
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid benzos due to concern for paradoxical agitation
   - consider head CT and/or LP if exam changes or mental status fails to
   improve over the next 24 hours
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Dysfunction
   - diuril and lasix as above
   - rate control with metoprolol
   .
   # MRSA line infection with bacteremia - HD catheter-associated line
   infection given positive tip culture [**9-7**] with MRSA and positive blood
   culture from [**9-8**]. 2 week treatment course began [**9-6**]. Recent
   surveillence cultures neg.
   - Central venous line in place, unable to get PIV
   - Continue vanc for 14 day course
   - continue to follow cultures
   - TTE to r/o endocarditis/valvular seeding
   .
   #. Proteus UTI - Complicated UTI in male requires 7 day treatment
   course. Initially treated with levofloxacin beginning on [**9-6**].
   - d/c Ctx 1 g q24 in favor of renally dosed ceftazadime
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline is mid-100s. Patient was at 92 on
   admission with INR at baseline of 1.3. DIC labs negative. Plts are
   currently 98 and stable. Heparin has been held due to concern for HIT.
   - f/u P4-Ab
   - continue to hold heparin and PPI/H-2 blockers/meds notorious for
   inducing thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Widened mediastinum on CXR
   - plan for CT to r/o aortic aneurysm
   .
   # AFib/FLUT: Not anti-coagulated. Currently in AFLUT. Held BB initially
   in settling of sepsis, resumed [**9-8**]. Rate is currently in the 120s in
   the setting of agitation and recent hypoxia.
   - metoprolol 5mg IV *3 for rate control with conversion to PO regimen
   upon improvement in his mental status
   - control agitation as above
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.
   - holding aspirin pending improvement in platelets
   .
   # Anemia: Likely chronic from renal disease
   - will monitor hct
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: On T/T/S schedule. HD tunnelled line
   removed on [**9-8**] in setting of MRSA line infection. Recently placed L AV
   fistula.
   - HD line placement this am followed by HD.
   - follow renal recommendations
   .
   # COPD: Most recent PFTs from [**2117**] showing restrictive dz, no clear
   COPD but low DLCO at that time. No wheezing on exam. Also h/o OSA but

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with fatigue and was found to be hypotensive with MRSA HD catheter-associated sepsis and a Proteus urinary tract infection (UTI). He initially improved but now has acute mental status changes (AMS), desaturation, and diastolic dysfunction. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney failure, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation/flutter (AFib/FLUT), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and femoral hernia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Refractory pulmonary edema/fluid overload: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to refractory pulmonary edema/fluid overload, especially during the removal of the HD line and fluid recessitation for hypotension. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's desaturation may also be due to pneumonia, which can be a common complication in patients with weakened immune systems or those who are critically ill.

3. Acute delirium: The patient's AMS could be due to acute delirium superimposed on chronic dementia. Other potential causes of AMS include medications (such as Ativan and antibiotics), metabolic abnormalities, new or"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD who presented with
   fatigue found to be hypotensive with MRSA HD catheter-associated sepsis
   and proteus UTI initially improved by now with AMS and hypoxia.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypoxia - 7L+ LOS in patient with underlying diastolic dysfunction
   on HD. Much of this hypoxia is likely [**1-20**] refractory pulmonary
   edema/fluid overload in setting of removal of HD line as well as fluid
   recessutation for hypotension. Other possibilites include PE,
   aspiration pneumonitis vs pna. Currently, sats are in high 90s on
   non-rebreather.
   - aggressive diuresis diuril 500mg IV and lasix 100mg IV
   - maintain sats >90% (Will likely be able to achieve this without the
   need for emergent line placement and overnight HD as the risks to such
   procedures outweigh their benfits in this patient at the current time.)
   - will monitor for need for more emergent line placement and HD but
   otherwise will plan for am HD line placement and HD with goal - several
   liters
   .
   #. AMS - Per chart review, the patient's baseline mental status is
   somewhat poor although his current state seems somewhat worse than his
   baseline.  This could likely be acute delirium superimposed on chronic
   dementia [**1-20**] hypoxia along with both his line infection and UTI. Other
   reasons for his AMS include: meds (ativan, abx), metabolic
   abnormalities, new or untreated infection, inctracranial pathology
   including hemorrhage. Would like to avoid head CT and/or LP as this
   patient has several conditions that explain his AMS and CT and LP would
   require sedation likely to the point of intubation, thereby exposing
   the patient to increased risks assoc with his care with likely low
   yield.
   - haldol 0.5-2 prn agitation
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid benzos due to concern for paradoxical agitation
   - consider head CT and/or LP if exam changes or mental status fails to
   improve over the next 24 hours
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Dysfunction
   - diuril and lasix as above
   - rate control with metoprolol
   .
   # MRSA line infection with bacteremia - HD catheter-associated line
   infection given positive tip culture [**9-7**] with MRSA and positive blood
   culture from [**9-8**]. 2 week treatment course began [**9-6**]. Recent
   surveillence cultures neg.
   - Central venous line in place, unable to get PIV
   - Continue vanc for 14 day course
   - continue to follow cultures
   - TTE to r/o endocarditis/valvular seeding
   .
   #. Proteus UTI - Complicated UTI in male requires 7 day treatment
   course. Initially treated with levofloxacin beginning on [**9-6**].
   - continue Ctx 1 g q24
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline is mid-100s. Patient was at 92 on
   admission with INR at baseline of 1.3. DIC labs negative. Plts are
   currently 98 and stable. Heparin has been held due to concern for HIT.
   - f/u P4-Ab
   - continue to hold heparin and PPI/H-2 blockers/meds notorious for
   inducing thrombocytopenia
   .
   # AFib: Not anti-coagulated. Currently in AFLUT. Held BB initially in
   settling of sepsis, resumed [**9-8**]. Rate is currently in the 120s in the
   setting of agitation and recent hypoxia.
   - metoprolol 5mg IV *3 for rate control with conversion to PO regimen
   upon improvement in his mental status
   - control agitation as above
   .
   # CAD: s/p MI.
   - holding aspirin pending improvement in platelets
   .
   # Anemia: Likely chronic from renal disease
   - will monitor hct
   .
   # Stage V Kidney Failure on HD: On T/T/S schedule. HD tunnelled line
   removed on [**9-8**] in setting of MRSA line infection. Recently placed L AV
   fistula.
   - HD line placement on [**9-10**] followed by HD.
   - follow renal recommendations
   .
   # COPD: Most recent PFTs from [**2117**] showing restrictive dz, no clear
   COPD but low DLCO at that time. No wheezing on exam. Also h/o OSA but
   refuses CPAP. Does desat overnight in association w/ apnea.
   - cont Tiotropium, albuterol prn
   - ordered for CPAP overnight but refuses
   - likely to benefit from PFTs as outpt, pulm outpt f/u
   .
   # History of CVA [**2117**] with R sided weakness:
   - holding aspirin due to low pts
   .
   # FEN: NPO until mental status improves
   .
   # Glycemic control
 good glycemic control
   .
   # ACCESS: left IJ placed in ED on [**9-6**]
   .
   # PPX: bowel regimen prn, pneumoboots
   .
   # CODE: Full

   # Disp: pending stable oxygenation (likely dependent upon ability to
   diurese)
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with fatigue and was found to be hypotensive with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) HD catheter-associated sepsis and Proteus urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient initially improved but now shows signs of acute mental status changes (AMS), hypoxia, and acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia - The patient's oxygen saturation levels are in the high 90s on non-rebreather, indicating potential respiratory distress or fluid overload.
2. Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS) - The patient's mental status has worsened, which could be due to hypoxia, infection, medication effects, metabolic abnormalities, or intracranial pathology.
3. MRSA Line Infection with Bacteremia - The patient has a confirmed MRSA line infection and bacteremia, requiring a 14-day treatment course.
4. Proteus UTI - The patient has a complicated UTI caused by Proteus, which requires a 7-day treatment course.
5. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
6. Atrial Fibrillation - The patient has"
