","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complex medical history. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has several comorbidities, including RV strain possibly due to a pulmonary embolism (PE), right upper extremity (RUE) compartment syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), and right hemithorax with subsequent chest tube placement. The patient's prognosis is described as grim, and there is no escalation of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has ARF, and there are no plans for dialysis. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on invasive ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Daily chest X-rays will be performed, and appropriate antibiotics will be continued.
3. Infection in the hemothorax: The patient has a chest tube in place, and there are concerns about a superimposed infection. Regular monitoring of the chest tube output and imaging may be necessary.
4. Compartment Syndrome/Myonecrosis: The patient has already undergone multiple fasciotomies and wound debridement due to compartment syndrome and myonecrosis. Close follow-up with plastics is essential to ensure proper wound management.
5. Drug-Related Complications: The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Monitoring for potential drug interactions or side effects is crucial.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Given the patient's prolonged immobilization and critical condition, there is a risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessment and repositioning are necessary to prevent them.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are recommended for accurate diagnosis and management of the patient's condition."

   28M with hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation
   found to have RV strain thought to be due to a possible PE.  Hospital
   course compliated by RUE compartment syndrome, ARF, right hemithorax
   s/p chest tube placement.  Overall grim prognosis, currently with no
   escalation of care
   #. Goals of care: No escalation of care. Continue treatment as current
   although with clear understanding of very poor prognosis and lack of
   response.
   .
   #. ARF: Per goals of care, dialysis will not be pursued
   n        Monitor K/Cr daily
   n        Would treat hyperkalemia if present
   .
   #. Hypotension: Refractory, still requiring levophed and vasopressin
   n        Levophed  up to 0.05 mcg
   n        Would continue Vasopressin at 2.4
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: Multiple possible sources including VAP,
   superinfected hemothorax, skin breakdown, proteus positive myonecrosis,
   mastoiditis, drug fever ETC.
   -- meropenam/cipro, vancomycin
   -- Dose Vanc by levels
   .
   #. Compartment Syndrome/myonecrosis: Stable, no interventions
   anticipated
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Persistently vent dependent.
   -- continue current vent settings, FIo2 at 100% now
   -- PEEP at 23 now, would not increase further given hypotension
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs
   #. hemothorax: chest tube in place
   # sedation: Continue methadone, diazepam, can give fentanyl prn for
   comfort.
   n        Would try to simplify regimen with fentanyl and versed only,
   plus PRN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. He was found to have right ventricular (RV) strain, which is thought to be due to a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's hospital course has been complicated by right upper extremity (RUE) compartment syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), and a right hemithorax that underwent chest tube placement.

The patient's prognosis is described as grim, and there is currently no escalation of care planned. The goals of care include continuing treatment as current, with the understanding of the very poor prognosis and lack of response. The patient has chosen to forgo dialysis for ARF, so monitoring potassium and creatinine levels daily is recommended. If hyperkalemia is present, it should be treated.

The patient continues to experience refractory hypotension, requiring levophed and vasopressin. The fever and leukocytosis could be due to various sources, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), superinfected hemothorax, skin breakdown, proteus positive myonecrosis, mastoiditis, or drug fever. Antibiotics have been initiated, and vancomycin dosing will be based on levels.

Compartment syndrome and myonecrosis appear to be stable, with no further interventions anticipated. The patient remains dependent on mechanical ventilation for respiratory support. Chest tube"

   28M with hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation
   found to have RV strain thought to be due to a possible PE.  Hospital
   course compliated by RUE compartment syndrome, ARF, right hemithorax
   s/p chest tube placement.  Overall grim prognosis, currently with no
   escalation of care

   #. ARF: Dialysis not indicated
   .
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: Multiple possible sources including VAP,
   superinfected hemothorax, skin breakdown, proteus positive myonecrosis,
   mastoiditis, drug fever ETC.
   -No escalation of care, continue meropenam/cipro,
   -ID recs/culture data
   .
   #. Compartment Syndrome/myonecrosis: s/p multiple fasciotomies and vac
   dressing placement by plastics.  Now with proteus growing on wound
   swab.
   - Plastics following, will continue debridement per their recs
   -current abx covers proteus
   - keep heparin off

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, RV strain possibly due to a pulmonary embolism (PE), right upper extremity (RUE) compartment syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), and a right hemithorax with chest tube placement. The patient's prognosis is described as grim, and there is no escalation of care.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.6°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/53-76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient is on multiple medications including vasopressin, fentanyl, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, heparin (for prophylaxis), and meropenem/ciprofloxacin antibiotics.

The patient has several potential medical complications. These include acute kidney injury (AKI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), superinfected hemothorax, skin breakdown, and myonecrosis with ongoing debridement. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided, but the respiratory support includes assist-control ventilation with a set tidal volume of 560 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 23 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%.

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management of his multiple organ dysfunctions, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and potential infections. Close communication and collaboration among the healthcare team members will be crucial in providing appropriate care for this patient."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 28-year-old male with hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- He was found to have RV strain, possibly due to a pulmonary embolism.
- The patient's hospital course has been complicated by right upper extremity compartment syndrome, acute renal failure, and right hemithorax with subsequent chest tube placement.
- The prognosis is grim, and there is no escalation of care planned.
- Sedation is currently well-controlled.
- The patient will not undergo dialysis for acute renal failure.
- Monitoring of potassium and creatinine levels will be done daily, and Kayexalate will be used for potassium level of 6.8.
- The patient remains hypotensive and requires levophed and vasopressin.
- There is a fever and leukocytosis, with multiple possible sources including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), superinfected hemothorax, skin breakdown, proteus-positive myonecrosis, mastoiditis, and drug fever.
- Antibiotics have been started, including meropenem and ciprofloxacin.
- Vancomycin will be dosed by levels.
- The patient's compartment syndrome/myonecrosis is stable, with no anticipated interventions.
- The patient persists with vent-dependent hypercarbic respiratory failure, with decreasing oxygen saturation.
- Current ventilator settings will continue, with FiO2 at 100% and PEEP at 23.
- Albuterol/ipratropium nebs will be administered.
- A chest tube is in place for hemothorax.
- Nutrition: Tube feeds have been held due to high residuals.
- Renal nutrition will be provided at a rate of 15 mL/hour.
- Glycemic control will be maintained.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous heparin, stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and VAP prevention with a bundle approach.
- The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status.
- Disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which could be indicative of an infection. Given that he is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor for symptoms such as worsening respiratory status, increased secretions, and changes in sputum color or odor.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive despite the use of vasopressors. This could indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and may lead to organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters is necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels indicate renal impairment. If not addressed promptly, this could progress to chronic renal failure. Daily monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid res"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4048**] is a 28M with hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure
   requiring intubation found to have RV strain thought to be due to a
   possible PE.  Hospital course compliated by RUE compartment syndrome,
   ARF, right hemithorax s/p chest tube placement.  Overall grim
   prognosis, currently with no escalation of care.
   # Sedation: Continue methadone, diazepam, can give fentanyl prn for
   comfort.
   - Would try to simplify regimen with fentanyl and versed only, plus PRN
   #. ARF: Per goals of care, dialysis will not be pursued
   -          Monitor K/Cr daily
   -          Would treat hyperkalemia if present
   #. Hypotension: Refractory, still requiring levophed and vasopressin
   -          Levophed  up to 0.05 mcg
   -          Would continue Vasopressin at 2.4
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: Multiple possible sources including VAP,
   superinfected hemothorax, skin breakdown, proteus positive myonecrosis,
   mastoiditis, drug fever ETC.
   -- meropenam/cipro, vancomycin
   -- Dose Vanc by levels
   #. Compartment Syndrome/myonecrosis: Stable, no interventions
   anticipated
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Persistently vent dependent.
   -- continue current vent settings, FIo2 at 100% now
   -- PEEP at 23 now, would not increase further given hypotension
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs
   #. Hemothorax: chest tube in place

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- He has been diagnosed with right ventricular (RV) strain, which may be due to a possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient's hospital course has been complicated by right upper extremity (RUE) compartment syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), and right hemithorax with subsequent chest tube placement.
- The patient's overall prognosis is grim, and there is no escalation of care planned.
- The patient is currently sedated with methadone, diazepam, and fentanyl as needed for comfort.
- Dialysis will not be pursued based on the goals of care, but potassium and creatinine levels will be monitored daily, and hyperkalemia will be treated if present.
- The patient's hypotension is refractory and requires the use of levophed and vasopressin.
- The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, with multiple possible sources including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), superinfected hemothorax, skin breakdown, Proteus-positive myonecrosis, mastoiditis, and drug fever.
- Antibiotics have been started, including meropenem/ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, with vancomycin dosing based on levels.
- The patient's compartment syndrome/myonecrosis is stable, and no further interventions are anticipated.
