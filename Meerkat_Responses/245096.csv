   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, complicated pulmonary history, respiratory failure due to
   ? GBS with subsequent airway obstruction and repeated stenting p/w
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: During Initially thought to be due to
   proximal airway obstruction with overgrowth of lumenal granulation
   tissue within the patient's y- stent.  The original plan was to take
   the patient to OR for stent removal.  However, pt also found to have
   e/o PNA & CHF, thus, OR on hold.  Pt remains on vent, desaturating when
   lying flat.
   -f/u CXR from this am
   -Will try bolus diuretic to keep to even w/ I/O
   -Continue to treat PNA, w/ unasyn since cx growing acinetobacter. Plan
   to treat for 14 days (currently day [**10-14**]) for VAP
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Plan to 0R when less of an 02 requirement for stent removal.  Goal
   PEEP <10, ideally 5, would like Fi02 60% or less.
   -f/u with IP
   ## Distended abd: pt w/ increasingly distended abd.  No documented
   stool for ~4 days.  KUB poor study.  PT seems to be wincing on exam w/
   palpation of abd.  Not yet responding to bowel regimen.  Also,
   increased bladder pressure.
   - CT scan w/ PO contrast (no IV) to eval for obstruction
   ## CHF: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm artery hypertension.
   Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities, nl to slightly
   depressed EF at 45%.
   -Hold on aggressive diuresis given ARF
   ## ARF: Cause unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 945**] not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Pt does
   have increased bladder pressure.
   -Renal consulted.
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ for ARF but may need to for add'l
   diuresis.
   -No ACEI for now.
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Was anticoagulated on lovenox.  Anticoagulation held after
   admission for GIB last month, will need to touch base with GI and pt's
   primary on whether to continue that.
   ## DM2: Return to home lantus regimen with RISS
   .
   ## Depression/anxiety:</I> Liberal ativan prn for anxiety.  Continue
   paxil, ? standing BZD  to prevent anxiety attacks associated with
   respiratory distress.
   .
   ## HTN: pt has periods of HTN during which she is anxious appearing
   (not sure if the anxiety is a result of the HTN or vice-versa).
   Continue amlodipine, BB, clonidine and hydral for now; will increase
   frequency of
   wean nitro as tolerated, consider addition of ACEI and or long acting
   nitrate. [**Month (only) 60**] need to hold off on ACEI until ARF resolves.  Holding on
   home norvasc.

","The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including chronic pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and depression/anxiety. She is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to presumed Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with subsequent airway obstruction and repeated stenting. 

The patient's 24-hour events include remaining on ventilatory support, discontinuation of lasix due to rising creatinine levels, elevated bladder pressure, and no bowel movement. Her allergies are to aspirin and an unknown medication. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/49 to 187/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,372 mL, with 447 mL given through the total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 855 mL given through the tube feeding (TF), and 177 mL given through intravenous fluids (IVF). The total output includes 780 mL of urine and 175 mL of nasogastric (NG) drainage. 

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by invasive ventilation, elevated central venous pressure, and rising creatinine levels. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and various ICU medications. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/49 to 187/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on invasive ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and plateau pressure of 31 cmH2O. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, elevated creatinine, and abnormal blood gas values. 

The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular status, skin condition, neurologic function, or any other physical examination findings. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged invasive ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and"

The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including complicated pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia (PNA), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), depression/anxiety, hypertension (HTN), and a recent gastrointestinal bleed (GIB).

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing airway obstruction with granulation tissue growth in the y-stent placed previously. The plan was to remove the stent, but it has been put on hold because the patient also has PNA and CHF.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/49 to 187/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and bladder pressure is elevated at 33 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,372 mL, including 447 mL of TF, 855 mL of PO, and 177 mL of IVF. Total output is 780 mL of urine and 175 mL of blood products. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is an obese, chronically ill woman in the ICU. She has a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and underwent a tracheostomy due to airway obstruction. The patient's current issues include hypoxic respiratory failure, partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), pneumonia (PNA), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute kidney injury (ARF), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient is also dealing with depression and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial hypoxic respiratory failure was caused by airway obstruction. Now, the main concern is maintaining adequate oxygenation while avoiding high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) that could worsen lung injury.
2. Partial SBO: The patient had a possible early SBO versus partial SBO. If the partial SBO progresses, it may lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, or systemic infection.
3. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been treated for PNA caused by Acinetobacter, a multi-drug resistant organism. If not properly managed, the infection could spread and cause sepsis.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's CHF is a chronic condition that requires careful management of fluid balance and"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, complicated pulmonary history, respiratory failure due to
   ? GBS with subsequent airway obstruction and repeated stenting p/w
   hypoxic respiratory failure.  Hosp course complicated by partial SBO,
   which now appears to be resolving
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: During Initially thought to be due to
   proximal airway obstruction with overgrowth of lumenal granulation
   tissue within the patient's y- stent.  The original plan was to take
   the patient to OR for stent removal.  However, pt also found to have
   e/o PNA & CHF, thus, OR on hold.  Pt remains on vent, desaturating when
   lying flat.
   -f/u CXR from this am
   -Will try bolus diuretic to keep to even w/ I/O
   -Continue to treat PNA, w/ unasyn since cx growing acinetobacter. Plan
   to treat for 14 days (currently day [**10-14**]) for VAP
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Plan to 0R when less of an 02 requirement for stent removal.  Goal
   PEEP <10, ideally 5, would like Fi02 60% or less.
   -f/u with IP
   ## Query Partial SBO: pt had increasingly distended abd.  CT w/
   possible early SBO vs partial SBO.  Suspect the latter. Significant
   volume of NGT/PEG.  Pt now stooling.  Also, increased bladder pressure.
   -          monitor abd exams & bladder pressure
   -
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Hold on aggressive diuresis given ARF
   ## ARF: Cause unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 945**] not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Pt does
   have increased bladder pressure.
   -Renal consulted.
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ for ARF but may need to for add'l
   diuresis.
   -No ACEI for now.
   ## HTN: significantly improved since decompressing pt
s abd.  pt has
   periods of HTN during which she is anxious appearing (not sure if the
   anxiety is a result of the HTN or vice-versa).
   Continue amlodipine, BB, clonidine and hydral for now; will increase
   frequency of
   wean nitro as tolerated, consider addition of ACEI and or long acting
   nitrate. [**Month (only) 60**] need to hold off on ACEI until ARF resolves.
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Was anticoagulated on lovenox.  Anticoagulation held after
   admission for GIB last month, will need to touch base with GI and pt's
   primary on whether to continue that.
   ## DM2: Return to home lantus regimen with RISS
   ## Depression/anxiety:</I> Liberal ativan prn for anxiety.  Continue
   paxil, ? standing BZD  to prevent anxiety attacks associated with
   respiratory distress.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical complications, including MMP, a complicated pulmonary history, respiratory failure due to possible Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) with subsequent airway obstruction and repeated stenting, partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia (PNA), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute kidney injury (ARF), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to airway obstruction and repeated stenting. The plan is to remove the stent once the patient's oxygen requirements decrease and PEEP can be reduced to less than 10 cmH2O.

2. Partial Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has signs of a partial SBO, which is now resolving. Monitoring abdominal exams and bladder pressure is important to assess any worsening of this condition.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy with no focal wall motion abnormalities. Diuretic therapy needs to be managed carefully due to the patient's acute kidney injury.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The cause"

   -Continue to treat PNA, will transition to Zosyn today given BAL now
   growing pseudomonas. Original treatment plan was for 14 days (currently
   day [**1-13**]) for VAP; however may adjust this pending results of repeat
   BAL today.
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Tentative plan is to OR for stent removal today.

   periods of HTN during which she is anxious appearing (not sure if the
   anxiety is a result of the HTN or vice-versa).
   - Continue amlodipine and clonidine; will titrate up hydral today
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Was anticoagulated on lovenox.  Anticoagulation held after
   admission for GIB last month, will need to touch base with GI and pt's
   primary on whether to continue that.
   ## DM2: Con

   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The note summarizes the patient's current condition and outlines potential medical complications that can arise.

The patient has a history of MMP (Multimodal Pathology Model), including previous GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome), tracheostomy with subsequent airway obstruction, and repeated stenting. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be due to proximal airway obstruction with overgrowth of luminal granulation tissue within the patient's Y-stent. However, the patient also has evidence of PNA (Pneumonia) and CHF (Congestive Heart Failure), leading to a hold on the original plan to take the patient to the operating room for stent removal. The plan now is to take the patient to surgery today.

The patient's I/O (Intake/Output) balance should be maintained to negative, and diuretics can be given as needed. Treatment for PNA will be continued, transitioning to Zosyn today since the BAL (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) is now growing pseudomonas. The original treatment plan was for 14 days of VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia); however, this may be adjusted pending the results of the repeat BAL today. Nebulizers will be used as needed, and a repeat CXR (Chest X-Ray) will be done today"

   primary on whether to continue that.
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS, dose reduce lantus
   ## Depression/anxiety: Much improved on midazolam gtt.  Continue home
   Paxil. Could add standing BZD  to prevent anxiety attacks associated
   with respiratory distress when gtt weaned off.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a medical history of multiple myeloma, gastroenteritis, and previous tracheostomy, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure. She also has a partial small bowel obstruction, congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by partial small bowel obstruction, which now appears to be resolving. She was initially thought to have airway obstruction due to overgrowth of granulation tissue within the y-stent placed previously. The plan was to take her to the operating room for stent removal, but it was put on hold because she also had evidence of pneumonia and congestive heart failure.

The patient's current plan includes continuing to try to keep her intake and output even to negative, attempting continued diuresis, treating pneumonia with Unasyn, and monitoring for any complications. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 172, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%.

   Chest [**7-18**]-concerning for increased RUL opacity.
   Assessment and Plan:  Agree with notes as outlined by House staff.
   Would add emphasize the following.
   1) respiratory failure due to hypoxemia (related to VAP and CHF) as
   well as tracheal stenosis
   -Continue Unasyn for acinetobacter pneumonia -.  Will broaden coverage
   to include Pseudomonas given +cx and new infiltrate and secretions.  IP
   to BAL RUL prior to initiating tx.
   2) Acute renal failure due to contrast, abdominal hypertension, less
   likely pre-renal.  Continues to produce urine.
   3) CHF related to diastolic dysfunction vs MR-Continue hydralazine 25
   q6, and isordil 20 tid, clonidine 0.2 [**Hospital1 **], Norvasc 10qday for improved
   blood pressure control. Hold beta blocker/ace. Continue lasix goal
   negative.
   4) Abdominal distension, partial SBO appreciate Surgical consultation.
   Moving bowels well.  Will repeat bladder pressures.

","The patient is a 79-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure due to severe tracheobronchomalacia and recent Y stent placement, recent Acinetobacter and stenotrophomonas pneumonia, admitted with respiratory distress thought due to recurrent Acinetobacter pneumonia and congestive heart failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 196/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 669 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 33 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 143 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, no conjunctival pallor or scleral edema, clear breath sounds bilaterally, and no wheezing or diminished breath sounds. The patient's extremities are edematous, and she is unable to stand. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count of 198 K/uL, creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 28 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, and calcium of 7.7 mg/dL. Imaging reveals increased opacity in the right upper lobe of the lung. Microbiology shows 3+ Gram-negative rods with more than 25 pus cells. 

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure due to hypoxemia (related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and congestive heart failure (CHF)), acute renal failure due to contrast, abdominal hypertension, and less likely pre-renal azotemia. The patient also has CHF related to diastolic dysfunction versus mitral regurgitation, abdominal distension with partial small bowel obstruction, agitation, and lost peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line. 

The patient's plan includes continuing Unasyn for Acinetobacter pneumonia, broadening coverage to include Pseudomonas given positive blood culture and new infiltrate, performing bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the right upper lobe before initiating therapy. The patient will continue on hydralazine, isordil, clonidine, and Novas for improved blood pressure control, hold beta blocker and ACE inhibitors, and continue lasix to achieve negative fluid balance. The patient will also be evaluated for surgical consultation for possible relief of abdominal distension."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure due to tracheobronchomalacia and recent Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas pneumonia. She was admitted with respiratory distress thought to be caused by recurrent Acinetobacter pneumonia and congestive heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications and ongoing issues.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to experience respiratory failure due to hypoxemia related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and congestive heart failure (CHF), as well as tracheal stenosis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and coverage should be broadened to include Pseudomonas given the positive culture results and new infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to contrast exposure, abdominal hypertension, or pre-renal causes. The patient is still producing urine, indicating that the kidneys are not completely failing. Continued monitoring and supportive care are necessary.

3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's CHF is likely related to diastolic dysfunction or mitral regurgitation. Blood pressure control should be managed with hydralazine, isordil, clonidine, and Norvasc. Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors should be held. The goal is to maintain negative fluid balance.

4. Abdominal dist"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Hosp course complicated by partial SBO, which now appears to
   be resolving
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initially thought to be due to proximal
   airway obstruction with overgrowth of lumenal granulation tissue within
   the patient's y- stent.  The original plan was to take the patient to
   OR for stent removal.  However, pt also found to have e/o PNA & CHF,
   thus, OR was on hold. Plan is to take pt to surgery today.
   -Continue to try to keep pt I/O even to negative; can try bolus
   diuretic PRN
   -Continue to treat PNA, will transition to Zosyn today given BAL now
   growing pseudomonas. Original treatment plan was for 14 days (currently
   day [**1-13**]) for VAP; however may adjust this pending results of repeat
   BAL today.
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Tentative plan is to OR for stent removal today.
   -repeat CXR today
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   to be resolving.
   - monitor abd exams & bladder pressure
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Attempt continued diuresis as above
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   - Monitor closely in setting of diuresis
   ## HTN: significantly improved since decompressing pt
s abd.  Pt has
   periods of HTN during which she is anxious appearing (not sure if the
   anxiety is a result of the HTN or vice-versa).
   - Continue amlodipine and clonidine; will titrate up hydral today
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Was anticoagulated on lovenox.  Anticoagulation held after
   admission for GIB last month, will need to touch base with GI and pt's
   primary on whether to continue that.
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS, dose reduce lantus
   ## Depression/anxiety: Much improved on midazolam gtt.  Continue home
   Paxil. Fentanyl for pain control/anxiolysis PRN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of multiple myeloma, previous Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and tracheostomy with subsequent airway obstruction and repeated stenting. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure initially thought to be due to proximal airway obstruction with overgrowth of luminal granulation tissue within the patient's y-stent. The plan was to take the patient to the operating room (OR) for stent removal, but it was put on hold due to findings of pneumonia (PNA) and congestive heart failure (CHF). The current plan is to proceed with surgery today.

The patient also had partial small bowel obstruction/illeus, which has improved after the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) and is now resolving. The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute renal failure (ARF) are being managed accordingly. The patient's hypertension (HTN) has significantly improved since decompressing the abdomen.

Other conditions include COPD, atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and depression/anxiety. The patient is receiving appropriate medications for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxic respiratory failure may recur if the planned surgery for stent removal does not proceed smoothly or if there are any complications during the procedure.

The patient underwent stoma revision and tracheostomy tube change to a larger size, as well as right upper lobe bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 499-669 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 36 cmH2O, and a spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 54 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 102/37 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient has a sinus bradycardia heart rhythm and is receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient has allergies to aspirin and an unknown allergen. The patient's medical and family history are under review.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory failure: multifactorial with malacia, VAP, obesity
   hypoventilation, pulm edema.
       VAP: awaiting BAL results
 continue Zosyn for now and adjust
   accordingly.
   2) Acute renal failure: worsening with relative hypotension overnight
   may be due to diuresis and poor perfusion. Watch UOP and CR today,
   renally dose all meds
   3) Relative Hypotension: complex situation with likely right worse than
   left heart failure, total body volume overloaded, intravsc may be even.
   We are holding hydral. Watch I and O but allow autoregulation today and
   monitor UOP and trend Cr
   4) Abdominal distension, partial SBO appreciate Surgical consultation.
   Moving bowels well
 now slowing with restart of fentanyl. Monitor
   closely. .
   5)Agitiation-On versed drip becomes agitated with withdrawal Did well
   off Versed all AM then went for PICC. Start po Zydis and wean Versed
   off again.
   6)Access-lost PICC line for replacement with IR today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is respiratory failure, and the patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient underwent a Y stent removal with intraoperative bronchoscopy (IP) yesterday. Post-procedure, they experienced severe tracheobronchomalacia, leading to the revision of the stoma to an extralong tracheostomy and right upper lobe bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient also displayed respiratory distress upon return, which was managed by increasing sedation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to good effect.

The patient has allergies to aspirin, and their last doses of antibiotics were ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) on 09/18/2103 at 07:41 AM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 09/19/2103 at 06:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 56 bpm (50-80 bpm), blood pressure of 103/35 mmHg (53) {89/34 (47) - 196/77 (110) mmHg}, respiratory"

   2) Acute renal failure: worsening with relative hypotension overnight
   and
   3) Relative Hypotension: complex situation with likely right worse than
   left heart failure, total body volume overloaded, intravsc may be even.
   We are holding hydral. Watch I and O but allow autoregulation today and
   monitor UOP and
   4) Abdominal distension, partial SBO appreciate Surgical consultation.
   Moving bowels well
 now slowing with restart.
   5)Agitiation-On versed drip becomes agitated with withdrawal.  Trial of
   pain control with fent.  Trial of zydis if no improvement with fent.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several potential medical complications. These complications include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, relative hypotension, abdominal distension with partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), agitation, and lost PICC line for replacement.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and involves malacia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), obesity hypoventilation, and pulmonary edema. The VAP is being treated with antibiotics (Zosyn), and further BAL results are pending.

The patient also has acute renal failure, which is worsening due to relative hypotension overnight. The cause of the relative hypotension is complex and includes likely right worse than left heart failure, total body volume overload, and intravascular volume depletion. Hydration is being closely monitored, and autoregulation is being allowed while observing urine output (UOP).

Abdominal distension and partial SBO have been noted, and a surgical consultation has been requested. The patient is moving bowels well but slowing down with restart.

The patient is also experiencing agitation, particularly during withdrawal, and is being treated with a versed drip. Pain control with fentanyl and a trial of zydis are also being considered if there is no improvement with fentanyl.

Lastly, the patient's PICC line cracked and is awaiting repair or replacement."

   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now, POD#1 s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach
   upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Due to tracheobroncheomalacia,
   multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema.  Having difficulty weaning from
   vent.  Minimal response to diuresis.
   -Decrease PEEP; wean vent as tolerated
   -Continue to treat PNA, w/ Zosyn (for pseudomonas) and adjust abx
   according to BAL.  Original treatment plan was for 14 days (currently
   day [**1-13**]) for VAP; however may adjust this pending results of repeat
   BAL.
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Hold diuresis for now given crt rising
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   resolved.
   - monitor abd exams & bladder pressure
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -hold on diuresis for now given relative hypotension and crt slightly
   up
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s.
   - Continue amlodipine and clonidine; will hold hydral and isosorbide
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month,
   ## DM2: Con

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of multifocal pneumonia (PNA), tracheobroncheomalacia, gastroenteritis (GBS), and chronic heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which is due to tracheobroncheomalacia, PNA, and pulmonary edema. The patient has undergone several procedures including tracheostomy revision, stent removal, and tracheal upgrade.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature at 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate of 75 bpm (normal range 53-85 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 183/62 mmHg to 194/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (normal range 5-49 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. The results also indicate mildly decreased total carbon dioxide level and glucose level.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, partial small bowel obstruction/ileus, CHF, acute renal failure (ARF), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atr"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Due to tracheobroncheomalacia,
   multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema.  Previously with difficulty
   weaning from vent, now with some progress.
   -Continue to wean PEEP, vent as tolerated
   -Continue to treat PNA, w/ Zosyn (for pseudomonas) and adjust abx
   according to BAL.  Original treatment plan was for 14 days (currently
   day 3 of Zosyn) for VAP; however may adjust this pending results of
   repeat BAL.
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Had been holding diuresis given elevated Cr; as pt clearly volume
   overloaded, will try Lasix gtt today.
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   resolved.
   - monitor abd exams & bladder pressure
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -try Lasix gtt today as above and trend Cr and volume status
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. Continue to titrate BP meds based on BP trends.
   - Continue amlodipine and clonidine; will hold hydral and, today,
   isosorbide
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month,
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS, dose reduce lantus
   ## Depression/anxiety: Much improved on midazolam gtt., however as this
   is not a long-term solution, will attempt to wean and titrate up
   olanzapine. Continue home Paxil. Fentanyl for pain control/anxiolysis
   PRN.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, partial small bowel obstruction/illeus, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute kidney injury (ARF), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and has undergone several interventions.

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure, with some fluctuations, and a heart rate within normal range. Her respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and she has a good oxygen saturation level. Her temperature is slightly below normal.

She is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and her ventilation parameters are within acceptable ranges. Her blood gases indicate a slight respiratory acidosis.

Physical examination reveals obesity, poor dentition, and marked anasarca. She has a tracheostomy in place and shows signs of fluid overload. Her extremities are cool with pitting edema. Neurologically, she is sedated.

Laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), low albumin, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Plan:

1. Continue weaning of PEEP and ventilation as tolerated.
2. Treat PNA"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Due to tracheobroncheomalacia,
   multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema.  Having difficulty weaning from
   vent.  Minimal response to diuresis.
   -Continue to wean PEEP, vent as tolerated
   -Continue to treat PNA, w/ Zosyn (for pseudomonas) and adjust abx
   according to BAL.  Original treatment plan was for 14 days (currently
   day 3 of Zosyn) for VAP; however may adjust this pending results of
   repeat BAL.
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Hold diuresis for now given Cr rising
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   resolved.
   - monitor abd exams & bladder pressure
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -hold on diuresis for now given relative hypotension and Cr slightly up
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s.
   - Continue amlodipine and clonidine; will hold hydral and isosorbide
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month,
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS, dose reduce lantus
   ## Depression/anxiety: Much improved on midazolam gtt.  Continue home

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multifocal pneumonia (PNA), tracheobroncheomalacia, and chronic heart failure (CHF). She also has a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to airway obstruction caused by tracheobroncheomalacia.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/40 mmHg to 97/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her temperature is within normal range at 36.7°C.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy tube placement, removal of Y stent, tracheal revision, and upgrade. She has also had a nasogastric tube (NGT) placed for suspected partial small bowel obstruction (SBO)/illeus, which has since resolved.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting an ongoing infection. Her creatinine levels are slightly elevated, indicating possible acute kidney injury (ARF) due to contrast nephropathy from a recent computed tomography angiography (CTA). Other lab results show mild abnormalities in liver function tests (LFTs) and electrolyte levels"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to factors such as malacia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), obesity hypoventilation, and pulmonary edema. The VAP is pending BAL results, and the patient is being continued on Zosyn.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of worsening renal failure, possibly due to relative hypotension overnight. This could be caused by diuresis and poor perfusion. Monitoring urine output (UOP) and creatinine (Cr) levels will be important.

3. Relative hypotension: The patient has relative hypotension with likely right worse than left heart failure, total body volume overload, and intravascular volume overload. Hydration will be closely monitored, and renal dosing of medications will be adjusted based on Cr levels.

4. Abdominal distension and partial small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has abdominal distension and partial SBO. Surgical consultation is needed to address this issue.

5. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, possibly due to withdrawal symptoms. The use of Versed has been initiated, and the patient is being weaned off it.

6. Access issues: The patient's PICC line was lost and needs to be replaced with an infrared (IR) line.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a [**Female First Name (un)**] who is critically ill with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, relative hypotension, abdominal distension, and agitation. The patient has worsening right upper lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray and sparse growth of Gram-negative bacilli in sputum culture. The patient's condition is complex and multifactorial, involving malacia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and pulmonary edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to the progression of VAP or new resistant organisms, further deterioration of renal function due to poor perfusion and volume overload, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) as the patient is critically ill and immobilized, and potential complications related to invasive procedures such as the arterial line, PICC line, and potential central venous catheterization for CVVH.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust medications accordingly. The patient's fluid balance should be carefully managed to prevent further volume overload. Nutritional support should be continued, and glycemic control should be monitored closely. Surgical consultation is recommended for the patient's abdominal distension and potential small bowel obstruction (SBO).

The patient's sedation should be carefully titrated to allow for weaning off ventilatory support while ensuring comfort. The results of the bronchoalve"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple comorbidities and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for the suspected pseudomonas infection. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 150/53 mmHg, heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sedation with fentanyl and lorazepam. The patient's recent ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, PaO2 of 68 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28 mEq/L. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 70-157 mg/dL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal creatinine, potassium, sodium, and liver function tests. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a tracheostomy tube in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Due to tracheobroncheomalacia,
   multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema.  Previously with difficulty
   weaning from vent, now with some progress.
   -Continue to wean PEEP, vent as tolerated
   -Continue to treat PNA, w/ Zosyn (for pseudomonas) and adjust abx
   according to BAL.  Original treatment plan was for 14 days (currently
   day 3 of Zosyn) for VAP; however may adjust this pending results of
   repeat BAL.
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Had been holding diuresis given elevated Cr; as pt clearly volume
   overloaded, will try Lasix gtt today.
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   resolved.
   - monitor abd exams & bladder pressure
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -try Lasix gtt today as above and trend Cr and volume status
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. Continue to titrate BP meds based on BP trends.
   - Continue amlodipine and clonidine; will hold hydral and, today,
   isosorbide
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month,
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS, dose reduce lantus
   ## Depression/anxiety: Much improved on midazolam gtt., however as this
   is not a long-term solution, will attempt to wean and titrate up
   olanzapine. Continue home Paxil. Fentanyl for pain control/anxiolysis
   PRN.

","The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including tracheobroncheomalacia, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, renal failure, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and depression/anxiety. The patient has had several complications and interventions, including airway obstruction, tracheostomy, Y stent removal, tracheal revision, and upgrade.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure due to tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and being weaned off gradually. The patient's pneumonia is being treated with Zosyn (for pseudomonas) and other antibiotics based on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results. Nebulizers are being used as needed.

The patient also has partial small bowel obstruction/ileus, which has improved after the placement of a nasogastric tube. Her abdominal exam will be monitored, and surgery recommendations will be appreciated.

Additionally, the patient has signs of congestive heart failure and total body overload, with recent findings of moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and a slightly depressed ejection fraction at 45%. Diuretics will be tried today to manage fluid overload and trend creatinine levels.

Renal failure is suspected due to elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, possibly related to contrast nephropathy from a recent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including tracheobroncheomalacia, pseudomonal pneumonia, acute kidney injury, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and agitation. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and has had several interventions including tracheostomy, airway stenting, and tracheal revision. The patient is difficult to wean from the ventilator and has multiple ongoing issues that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilation: The patient's difficulty in weaning off the ventilator increases the risk of prolonged ventilation, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia and other complications.
2. Infection: The presence of pseudomonal pneumonia and the patient's immunocompromised state increase the risk of further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate an ongoing kidney problem, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Congestive heart failure: The patient's moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy suggest underlying heart issues that need to be managed carefully to prevent further deterioration.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD puts her at risk for exacerbations, which can be triggered by infections or other respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is multifactorial with malacia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), obesity hypoventilation, and pulmonary edema.
- VAP is caused by Acinetobacter and will be treated with Meropenem if sensitive, otherwise high dose Unasyn will be used. Bactrim will not be used due to profound nephrotoxicity.
- The patient also has acute renal failure, and efforts are being made to maintain a negative fluid balance of around 500 cc per day by increasing Lasix gttts and adding [Hospital1] Diuril. CVVHD may be considered, and the family needs to be discussed regarding this option.
- Hemodynamics are stable, but there is a trend of higher blood pressure during agitation.
- The patient has abdominal distension and partial small bowel obstruction (SBO). Surgical consultation is appreciated, and the patient is now moving bowels well after restarting fentanyl. Close monitoring is advised.
- The patient is experiencing agitation and is being weaned off versed. Zydis is being tried orally, and the fentanyl patch is being used instead of IV fentanyl with the option to use fentanyl bolus as needed.
- The patient's ICU orders include SC Hep, PPI, and FULL CODE. The healthcare power of attorney is the daughter, and the ICU nurse is [Name2 (NI)].

   CXR ([**9-21**]):
   Since yesterday, right PICC line tip is in unchanged position at the
   junction
   of both brachiocephalic veins. A tracheostomy is in unchanged position.
   Cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening are unchanged. Right upper lobe
   consolidation persists. Left mid lung and basilar atelectasis are
   unchanged.
   Pulmonary congestion slightly decreased.
   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema.
   Currently treating Pseudomonas with Zosyn. Options for Acinetobacter
   coverage include Bactrim, which is not ideal given the patient
   current renal function. Awaiting sensitivities to Meropenem as this
   would be a better option for coverage. Currently, patient is not
   requiring more oxygen, is afebrile, down-trending WBC and scant
   secretions, suggesting that acute broadening of coverage is not
   necessary. Other contributor to hypoxic respiratory failure is
   pulmonary edema, less evident on CXR, but certainly contributing from
   heavy chest wall in the setting of anasarca and subsequent decreased
   lung compliance. Attempting diuresis with some difficulty.
   -Continue Zosyn for pseudomonas treatment. Await sensitivities to
   Acinetobacter. F/U ID recs
   -Will increase Lasix gtt and Diuril
   -Continue nebs as needed
   .
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   resolved.
   - monitor abd exams and bladder pressure
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   .
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Continue diuresis as above
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with sedation PRN
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month,
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS/Lantus
   ## Agitation: Unclear to what extent pt
s agitation is caused by pain
   versus possible anxiety. Appears to respond well to fentanyl, thus have
   transitioned to fentanyl patch and will bolus PRN. Continue olanzapine.
   Try to avoid benzos as much as possible as this may contribute to
   delirium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old female with multifactorial medical problems including history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), tracheobroncheomalacia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.
- She was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
- The patient underwent tracheostomy revision and upgrade, as well as Y stent removal.
- She is currently being treated for Pseudomonas infection with Zosyn and awaiting sensitivities to Acinetobacter for appropriate antibiotic coverage.
- The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.
- Pulmonary edema is contributing to the hypoxia, despite decreased congestion on chest X-ray.
- Diuretics are being used with some difficulty to manage pulmonary edema.
- The patient also has partial small bowel obstruction/ileus, which has improved after nasogastric tube placement and subsequent removal.
- She has moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and normal to slightly depressed ejection fraction at 45%.
- The patient's acute kidney injury is likely due to contrast nephropathy from a recent computed tomography angiography (CTA).
- Renal consultation has been requested.
- The patient's hypertension is relatively well-controlled, except during periods of anxiety.

   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Due to tracheobroncheomalacia,
   multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema. Pt has been persistently
   difficult to wean from vent.
   -Continue weaning as tolerated
   -Continue to treat PNA w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonal coverage. Most recent
   BAL with ACINETOBACTER and STENOTROPHOMONAS. Appreciate ID recs
   concerning alternative regimen to treat for these organisms; concern
   for degree of nephrotoxicity with this drugs.
   -ask lab to add on [**Last Name (un) 430**] sensitivities as this may allow an alternative
   treatment regimen for pt
s probable PNA
   -Continue nebs as needed
   -Continue Lasix gtt today with uptitration; will add [**Hospital1 **] Diuril
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   resolved.
   - monitor abd exams and bladder pressure
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -continue Lasix gtt today as above and trend Cr and volume status
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. Continue to titrate BP meds based on BP trends.
   - Continue amlodipine and clonidine; will hold hydral and, today,
   isosorbide
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month,
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS, dose reduce lantus
   ## Agitation: Unclear to what extent pt
s agitation is caused by pain
   versus possible anxiety. Appears to respond well to fentanyl, thus have
   transitioned to fentanyl patch and will bolus PRN. Continue olanzapine.
   Try to avoid benzos as much as possible as this may contribute to
   delirium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of multifocal pneumonia (PNA), tracheobroncheomalacia (TBM), and congestive heart failure (CHF). She has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure, partial small bowel obstruction (SBO)/illeus, acute kidney injury (ARF), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient underwent tracheostomy tube removal, tracheal revision, and upgrade, and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to TBM, multifocal PNA, and pulmonary edema. She has been persistently difficult to wean from the ventilator.
2. Partial SBO/Ileus: The patient's abdominal distention has improved following the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT). The process appears to be resolved.
3. CHF/Total Body Overload: Recent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with no focal wall motion abnormalities, normal to slightly depressed ejection fraction (EF) at 45%.
4. ARF: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may be related to possible"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including tracheobroncheomalacia, pulmonary edema, partial small bowel obstruction/ileus, congestive heart failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, COPD, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and agitation. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has had various interventions and treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains difficult to wean from the ventilator. She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent difficulty in being weaned from the ventilator suggests a risk of continued hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas in the patient's sputum culture indicates a possible pneumonia, which needs to be treated appropriately.
3. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine levels and the history of contrast nephropathy suggest a risk of renal failure, especially considering the patient's pre-existing kidney disease.
4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's history of CHF and the presence of pulmonary edema indicate a potential risk of worsening heart failure.
5. Small Bowel Obstruction/Ileus: Although the patient's abdominal distention has improved, there is still a risk of recurrent small bowel obstruction/ileus.
6. Hypertension: The patient's relatively hypotensive state except during periods of anxiety suggests a need for careful management of blood pressure.
7. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes needs to be closely monitored due to the risk of fluctuating blood glucose levels.
8. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and off anticoagulation therapy due to gastrointestinal bleeding pose a risk of thromboembolic events.
9. Agitation: The patient's agitation requires careful management to avoid delirium and ensure comfort.
10. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent a tracheostomy and tracheobroncheal stenting, but subsequently experienced airway obstruction and required repeated stenting. The patient's airway obstruction persisted despite Y stent removal, tracheostomy revision, and tracheostomy upgrade.

The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator, and her condition is complicated by tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. She is currently being treated with Zosyn for Pseudomonal coverage, as recent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results showed Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections. The healthcare team is awaiting sensitivity results for Acinetobacter to determine an alternative treatment regimen.

The patient also has a partial small bowel obstruction/ileus, which has improved after the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) and subsequent removal. Her abdominal exams and bladder pressure will be monitored to ensure resolution of the process.

Additionally, the patient has congestive heart failure (CHF) with moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) without focal wall motion abnormalities. Her ejection fraction (EF) is at 45%.

Renal function is impaired, and the patient may have"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 PMH chronic respiratory failure related to GBS and TBM now with
   recurrent episode.  She has consistently grown MDR bacteria in her
   sputum and is volume overloaded.  Over the past 24 hours, her FiO2 has
   come down to 50% and she has only a small amount of secretions.  She
   has been afebrile and her WBC is overall improved.
   1)       Respiratory failure
 There are currently no acute indications
   for broadening her antibiotic therapy at this point.  We are awaiting
   sensitivities on the Acinetobacter from [**9-18**].  We will continue Zosyn
   for now.  Continue PSV, albuterol.
   2)       Anasarca
 Continue lasix and diuril, which we will increase
   diuril to 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Goal negative 1 L.
   3)       Sedation
 Has hemodynamic response to stimulation with ~15
   minutes of hypertension.  Fentanyl patch recently begun so we will
   discontinue the Fentanyl gtt and use boluses as needed.
   4)       HTN
 Continue amlodipine, clonidine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and tuberculous meningitis (TBM). She has been admitted multiple times with recurrent respiratory failure and has been in the ICU. The patient has an obstructed Y-stent and has grown Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and PsA in her sputum. She is currently receiving antibiotics (Zosyn) and diuretics for volume overload. The patient is also sedated and on ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in her respiratory function, requiring continuous monitoring and management.
2. Infection: The presence of Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and PsA in the sputum indicates a risk of infection. There is a potential for these bacteria to cause a severe infection, which could worsen the patient's condition.
3. Volume overload: The patient is currently being diuresed for volume overload. If not effectively managed, this could lead to congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.
4. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, which is generalized edema. If not addressed, it may worsen and contribute to respiratory distress or other complications.
5. Sedation: The patient is sedated, and any changes in her"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a current weight of 120 kg. He was admitted to the ICU for an unknown reason. The patient's medical history includes allergies to aspirin and an unknown allergy. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including Fentanyl, Lasix, Diurill, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Heparin Sodium, and ProBalance nutrition.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but his blood pressure is elevated at 147/62 mmHg. His heart rate is stable at 78 bpm, respiratory rate is within normal limits at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained above 90%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilator support with a tidal volume of 355 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 33 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, blood glucose, and lactate levels. The platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, total CO2, and electrolytes are within normal limits. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 103 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg.

During the 24-hour period, the patient's FiO2 was decreased from 60% to 50%, but later increased back to 60% due to agitation and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient also experienced hypertension, which was treated with multiple Fentanyl boluses and Nitro TP. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,104 mL and output of 2,555 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 451 mL.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and potential glycemic control issues due to high blood glucose levels. The elevated blood pressure may require further management, and close monitoring of the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema.
   Currently treating Pseudomonas with Zosyn. Options for Acinetobacter
   coverage include Bactrim, which is not ideal given the patient
   current renal function. Awaiting sensitivities to Meropenem as this
   would be a better option for coverage. Currently, patient is not
   requiring more oxygen, is afebrile, down-trending WBC and scant
   secretions, suggesting that acute broadening of coverage is not
   necessary. Other contributor to hypoxic respiratory failure is
   pulmonary edema, less evident on CXR, but certainly contributing from
   heavy chest wall in the setting of anasarca and subsequent decreased
   lung compliance. Attempting diuresis with some difficulty.
   -Continue Zosyn for pseudomonas treatment. Await sensitivities to
   Acinetobacter. F/U ID recs
   -Will increase Lasix gtt and Diuril
   -Continue nebs as needed
   .
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   resolved.
   - monitor abd exams and bladder pressure
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   .
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Continue diuresis as above
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with sedation PRN
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month,
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS/Lantus
   ## Agitation: Unclear to what extent pt
s agitation is caused by pain
   versus possible anxiety. Appears to respond well to fentanyl, thus have
   transitioned to fentanyl patch and will bolus PRN. Continue olanzapine.
   Try to avoid benzos as much as possible as this may contribute to
   delirium.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of Multifocal Pulmonary Infiltrates with Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, tracheobroncheomalacia, pseudomonas infection, anasarca, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and agitation.

The patient's recent events include a decision not to broaden antibiotic coverage as she had not decompensated clinically. Lasix and Diuril were increased to diurese close to goal negative/day. The patient's FiO2 was decreased from 60% to 50%, but later dropped her oxygen saturation (sats) and became agitated despite suctioning. In this setting, the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased, and eventually, FiO2 was returned to 60%. Fentanyl gtt could not be weaned off, resulting in hypertension, which was treated with multiple fentanyl boluses as well as nitro TP.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/62 mmHg to 199/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is currently 120 kg, and her height is 64 inches"

   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD.
   s/p treatment for acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with bactrim and
   unasyn this admission. Now being treated with zosyn for pseudomonas
   pna.  Had initially contemplated again treating for the other two above
   organisms, was considering meropenem, however  pseudomonas now resulted
   as resistant. Given improvement on CXR, pt not decompensating with no
   increased fevers, wbc or sputum production, will not plan to broaden
   coverage at this time.  ABG overnight showed hypercarbia, this was in
   setting of hypopnea, potentially related to sedation with fentanyl.  Pt
   also with COPD with wheezes on exam which could be contributing to dead
   space and difficulty with ventilation
   -Continue Zosyn for pseudomonas treatment.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and diuril
   -Increase nebs to Q4
   -Monitor pt
s sedation/RR/tidal volumes.  Check ABG when pt not
   hypopneic.  If pt persistently requiring sedation with fentanyl to the
   point where she RR/TV fall will switch to mandatory ventilation mode on
   vent.
   .
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. This is now removed and pt is now stooling.  Process seems
   resolved. Had BM last night at MN
   - monitor abd exams and bladder pressure
   -Continue bowel regiment.
   .
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Continue diuresis as above, have recently increased gtt and diuril
   dose. Renal function has stayed stable. Goal neg 1 L today.
   -check [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing.
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   -renal function stable while diuresing.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation, treat as below.
   ## COPD: Continue MDI
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month,
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS/Lantus
   ## Agitation/AMS: Difficult at present to establish pt
s mental status.
   Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since transfer
   to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on multiple
   sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa. Got
   haldol this am during rounds for agitation.  Plan to attempt to return
   pt to rehab doses of pain/anxiety/psych meds in order to  better
   elucidate her mental status as compared to how she was at rehab.
   -d/c fentanyl patch
   -consider adding  back standing [**Hospital1 **] PO ativan if tolerates seroquel
   -Re-start home dose seroquel
   -continue fentanyl gtt with boluses as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tracheobroncheomalacia, and multiple pulmonary infections. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypoxic respiratory failure, partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), ileus, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient is sedated and unresponsive on multiple sedating medications, which makes it difficult to establish her mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, requiring close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings. There is a risk of worsening hypoxia and further respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary Infections: The patient has a history of multiple pulmonary infections, including Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas. These infections can recur or worsen, leading to increased inflammation and potential spread to other organs.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen due to the ongoing respiratory failure, leading to increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production.
4. CHF: The patient's heart failure symptoms may worsen, resulting in fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and reduced cardiac output.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 F chronic respiratory failure secondary to GBS and severe TBM, h/o
   infection with Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas admitted with recurrent
   hypoxic respiratory failure.  So far in her course, she has been
   treated for a RUL pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca.  Her SBO
   seems to be improved.  Over the past 24 hours, her ventilation seems to
   have worsened, which may be related to either sedation or increase dead
   space.  Review of ABG and Ve points toward respiratory depression from
   narcotics.
   1)       Respiratory failure
 Complete course of therapy with Zosyn.
   Increase combivent to Q4H.  Repeat ABG this afternoon.  Minimize
   sedation.
   2)       Agitation
 Previously had better mental status on regimen of
   Seroquel, celexa, Ativan and oxycodone at [**Hospital1 82**].  Will resume
   previous dose of Seroquel today and attempt to minimize fentanyl
   infusion.  DC fentanyl patch.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to add parenteral oxycodone in
   order to completely wean fentanyl.
   3)       Anasarca
 Continue lasix, diuril for goal I/O negative 500 cc
   to 1 L.
   4)       CRI
 Creatinine stable.  Holding HCTZ, ACEI.
   5)       HTN
 Correlates with agitation.  Continue clonidine,
   amlodipine.
   6)       Partial SBO -  Continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel regimen.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and severe tuberculous bronchitis (TBM), who was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure. During her admission, she underwent removal of the Y-stent due to obstruction from granulation tissue, treatment of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and diuresis for diffuse anasarca.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 196/60 mmHg to 219/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 638 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 61 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 158, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 8.2 L/min.

The patient's laboratory values include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.4 K/uL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and severe Tuberculosis (TBM). She has undergone several treatments including removal of a Y-stent due to obstruction from granulation tissue, treatment for Acinetobacter and PsA infection, and diuresis for diffuse anasarca.

During her current admission, the patient has experienced recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been treated for a right upper lobe (RUL) pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca. However, her ventilation has worsened over the past 24 hours, which may be related to either sedation or increased dead space.

The patient's vital signs show hypertension, hypoxia, and a temperature within normal range. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. Her respiratory support indicates that she is dependent on the ventilator, with a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute and a tidal volume (Vt) of 638 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Her creatinine level is stable, and her electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging shows cardiomegaly and a resolving opacity in the right upper lobe"

   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD.
   s/p treatment for acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with bactrim and
   unasyn this admission. Now being treated with zosyn for pseudomonas
   pna.  Still requiring significant ventilatory support. Given
   improvement on CXR, pt not decompensating with no increased fevers, wbc
   or sputum production, will hold on broadening coverage at this time.
   ABG with slightly improved hypercarbia on lower fentanyl dosing.
   -Continue Zosyn for pseudomonas treatment, currently day 7.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and diuril
   -Nebs to Q4
   -Monitor pt
s sedation/RR/tidal volumes.  Wean PEEP if possible
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Continue diuresis as above, have recently increased gtt and diuril
   dose. Renal function has stayed stable. Goal neg 1 L today.
   -check [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   -renal function stable while diuresing.
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. Pt is now stooling.  Process seems resolved.
   -Continue bowel regiment.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as below.
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Difficult at present to establish pt
s mental
   status. Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since
   transfer to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on
   multiple sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component.  (Source of potential pain not clear
abd NT as it was
   previously--? [**3-3**] trach).  Plan was to attempt to return pt to rehab
   doses of pain/anxiety/psych meds in order to better elucidate her
   mental status as compared to how she was at rehab.  However, for now,
   will con
t olanzapine w/ PRN dosing & if addition of PRN dosing not
   effective will dc that & start seroquel.
   -standing olanzapine (increase from [**Hospital1 **] to TID) w/ PRN doses for
   brkthrough agitation.
   -DC home dose seroquel for now (to avoid too many psych meds, partic as
   QTc borderline).  Hold on haldol for agitation.
   -continue fentanyl gtt with boluses as needed; however, may consider
   giving methadone 20mg IV x1 in place of fentanyl (per pharmacy) as this
   may eventually allow pt to be transitioned to methadone PO long term

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multifactorial hypoxic respiratory failure, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and COPD. She has a history of GBS, tracheostomy, airway obstruction, repeated stenting, and treatment for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. Currently, she is being treated with Zosyn for pseudomonas pneumonia and requires significant ventilatory support. Her recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild LVH, no focal wall motion abnormalities, and a normal to slightly depressed EF at 45%. She also has acute renal failure with elevated urea not consistent with pre-renal azotemia, possibly due to contrast nephropathy after a CTA. The patient's abdominal distention has improved with NGT placement, indicating a resolved partial small bowel obstruction/ileus. She is experiencing agitation, altered mental status, and hypertension, which may be related to GBS and autonomic dysfunction. She is currently on multiple sedating medications and has had an unsuccessful trial of benzodiazepines for agitation. She is also experiencing pain, possibly from tracheostomy or other sources. The plan is to attempt to wean her off sedation and reintroduce psychotropic medications to better assess her mental status.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support due to hypoxic respiratory failure. This may require continued monitoring and intervention.

2. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas pneumonia and is being treated with Zosyn. There is a risk of treatment failure or resistance, so close monitoring of the patient's response to antibiotics is necessary.

3. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD and is experiencing wheezing on examination. This could indicate an exacerbation of COPD, which may require adjustment of the ventilator settings or additional bronchodilator therapy.

4. CHF/Total body overload: The patient has signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) with pulmonary artery hypertension and mild LVH. The patient is currently being diuresed with Lasix and Diuril to manage fluid overload.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, possibly due to contrast nephropathy from a recent CTA. Renal function should be closely monitored, and further consultation may be required.

6. Agitation/AMS: The patient is experiencing agitation and altered mental status (AMS), which is difficult to assess due to multiple sedating medications. The current plan is to attempt to reduce sedation and re-evaluate mental status.

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD.
   s/p treatment for acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with bactrim and
   unasyn this admission. Now being treated with zosyn for pseudomonas
   pna.  Still requiring significant ventilatory support. Given
   improvement on CXR, pt not decompensating with no increased fevers, wbc
   or sputum production, will hold on broadening coverage at this time.
   ABG with slightly improved hypercarbia on lower fentanyl dosing.
   -Continue Zosyn for pseudomonas treatment, currently day 7.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and diuril
   -Nebs to Q4
   -Monitor pt
s sedation/RR/tidal volumes.  Wean PEEP if possible
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Continue diuresis as above, have recently increased gtt and diuril
   dose. Renal function has stayed stable. Goal neg 1 L today.
   -check [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   -renal function stable while diuresing.
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. Pt is now stooling.  Process seems resolved.
   -Continue bowel regiment.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as below.
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Difficult at present to establish pt
s mental
   status. Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since
   transfer to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on
   multiple sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component.  (Source of potential pain not clear
abd NT as it was
   previously--? [**3-3**] trach).  Plan was to attempt to return pt to rehab
   doses of pain/anxiety/psych meds in order to better elucidate her
   mental status as compared to how she was at rehab.  However, for now,
   will con
t olanzapine w/ PRN dosing & if addition of PRN dosing not
   effective will dc that & start seroquel.
   -standing olanzapine w/ PRN doses for brkthrough agitation
   -DC home dose seroquel for now (to avoid too many psych meds, partic as
   QTc borderline)
   -continue fentanyl gtt with boluses as needed; however
   -f/u TSH

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of multifactorial pulmonary issues including tracheobroncheomalacia, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections, and is currently being treated with Zosyn for pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient is still requiring significant ventilatory support and has shown some improvement on chest X-ray. 

The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) and total body overload, as evidenced by moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy with no focal wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram. 

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF) possibly due to contrast nephropathy after a computed tomography angiography (CTA). 

Additionally, the patient had a partial small bowel obstruction/ileus, which has improved since the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT). 

The patient has hypertension, which is relatively controlled except during periods of anxiety when blood pressure rises. 

The patient is experiencing agitation and altered mental status, making it difficult to assess her mental status. 

Plan:
- Continue Zosyn for pseudomonas treatment, currently on day 7.
- Continue diuresis with Lasix gtt and Diuril.
- Nebulize every 4 hours.
- Monitor sedation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has a history of agitation, hypertension, and altered mental status (AMS). The patient requires ongoing sedation management with fentanyl and has been given additional doses of haloperidol. There are ongoing attempts to adjust sedation due to the patient's agitation and AMS. The patient has also been restarted on seroquel. The patient's ABG results have remained virtually unchanged throughout the day, despite adequate minute ventilation. The patient is producing increased purulent secretions and has slightly negative responses to lasix gtt/diuril, although not at goal. The patient has multiple allergies, including aspirin, and is currently on various medications including fentanyl, furosemide (lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection such as increased purulent secretions and changes in oxygenation is essential.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or anticoagulation should be considered to prevent this complication.

3. Stress ulcer: P"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing agitation, hypertension, and increased purulent secretions. He requires mechanical ventilation and is receiving multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and antipsychotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. delirium: The patient's agitation and fluctuating level of consciousness suggest the possibility of delirium, which can complicate the clinical picture and increase the risk of complications.
3. nosocomial infection: Given the prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of acquiring new infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pressure ulcers.
4. renal dysfunction: The patient's baseline kidney function is impaired, and there is a concern for further deterioration due to sepsis and potential nephrotoxic medications.
5. cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension and the recent QTc prolongation on the EKG indicate a potential risk for cardiac arrhythmias or ischemic events.
6. deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation.

   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD.
   s/p treatment for acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with bactrim and
   unasyn this admission. Now being treated with zosyn for pseudomonas
   pna.  Still requiring significant ventilatory support. Given
   improvement on CXR, pt not decompensating with no increased fevers, wbc
   or sputum production, will hold on broadening coverage at this time.
   ABG with slightly improved hypercarbia on lower fentanyl dosing.
   -Continue Zosyn for pseudomonas treatment, currently day 7.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and diuril
   -Nebs to Q4
   -Monitor pt
s sedation/RR/tidal volumes.  Wean PEEP if possible
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Continue diuresis as above, have recently increased gtt and diuril
   dose. Renal function has stayed stable. Goal neg 1 L today.
   -check [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   -renal function stable while diuresing.
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. Pt is now stooling.  Process seems resolved.
   -Continue bowel regiment.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as below.
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Difficult at present to establish pt
s mental
   status. Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since
   transfer to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on
   multiple sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component.  (Source of potential pain not clear
abd NT as it was
   previously--? [**3-3**] trach).  Plan was to attempt to return pt to rehab
   doses of pain/anxiety/psych meds in order to better elucidate her
   mental status as compared to how she was at rehab.  However, for now,
   will con
t olanzapine w/ PRN dosing & if addition of PRN dosing not
   effective will dc that & start seroquel.
   -standing olanzapine (increase from [**Hospital1 **] to TID) w/ PRN doses for
   brkthrough agitation.
   -DC home dose seroquel for now (to avoid too many psych meds, partic as
   QTc borderline).  Hold on haldol for agitation.
   -continue fentanyl gtt with boluses as needed; however, may consider
   giving methadone 20mg IV x1 in place of fentanyl (per pharmacy) as this
   may eventually allow pt to be transitioned to methadone PO long term

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including MMP, GBS, tracheobroncheomalacia, COPD, CHF, ARF, and DM2. She has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which has been treated with mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. The patient's recent events include tracheostomy, airway obstruction, stenting, removal of Y stent, tracheal revision, and upgrade. 

The patient continues to require significant ventilatory support and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for pseudomonas pneumonia. Her sedation levels are being monitored, and weaning of PEEP is being considered. 

The patient also has CHF/total body overload with moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, LVH, and a mildly depressed ejection fraction. Diuretics are being used for fluid management. 

Renal function is stable, but the patient has acute kidney injury, possibly due to contrast nephropathy from a recent CTA. 

There is improvement in partial small bowel obstruction/ileus, and the patient is now stooling after NG tube placement. 

The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, likely due to GBS and autonomic dysfunction. 

The patient exhibits agitation, altered mental status, and potential pain components. Various medications have been tried to manage agitation, including benzodiazepines, fentanyl, and olanzapine. 

The patient has COPD and"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 F chronic respiratory failure secondary to GBS and severe TBM, h/o
   infection with Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas admitted with recurrent
   hypoxic respiratory failure.  So far in her course, she has been
   treated for a RUL pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca.  Her SBO
   seems to be improved.  Over the past 24 hours, her ventilation seems to
   have worsened, which may be related to either sedation or increase dead
   space.  Review of ABG and Ve points toward respiratory depression from
   narcotics.
   1)       Respiratory failure
 Multiple organisms on BAL but elected to
   Rx only the Pseudomonas. We will complete course of therapy with Zosyn
   14 days.  Increase combivent to Q4H. Try to wean Fio2
   2)       Agitation
 Previously had better mental status on regimen of
   Seroquel, celexa, Ativan and oxycodone at [**Hospital1 82**].  Will resume
   previous dose of Seroquel today and attempt to minimize fentanyl
   infusion.  DC fentanyl patch.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to add parenteral oxycodone in
   order to completely wean fentanyl.
   3)       Anasarca
 Continue lasix, diuril for goal I/O negative 500 cc
   to 1 L.
   4)       CRI
 Creatinine stable.  Holding HCTZ, ACEI.
   5)       HTN
 Correlates with agitation.  Continue clonidine,
   amlodipine.
   6)       Partial SBO -  Continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure due to Guillain-Barré syndrome and severe tuberculosis. She has a history of infection with Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. She was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been treated for right upper lobe pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca. Her small bowel obstruction seems to be improved. Over the past 24 hours, her ventilation has worsened, which may be related to sedation or increased dead space. Review of ABG and Ve points towards respiratory depression from narcotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient is experiencing worsening ventilation, which may lead to further respiratory failure. She has multiple organisms on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), but only Pseudomonas is being treated. The current treatment plan includes completing the course of therapy with Zosyn for 14 days, increasing Combivent to Q4H, and attempting to wean FiO2.

2. Agitation - The patient's mental status has worsened, and she is experiencing agitation. The previous regimen of Seroquel, celexa, Ativan, and oxycodone has been effective. The plan is to resume the previous dose of Seroquel today and attempt to minimize fentanyl infusion. The fentanyl patch will be discontinued, and parenteral oxycodone will be added to completely wean fentanyl.

3. Anasarca - The patient has diffuse anasarca, and the plan is to continue Lasix and Diuril to achieve a goal of negative 500 cc to 1 L intake/output balance.

4. CRI (Chronic Renal Insufficiency) - The patient's creatinine levels are stable, and HCTZ and ACEI will be held.

5. HTN (Hypertension) - The patient's hypertension correlates with agitation. The current plan includes continuing clonidine and amlodipine.

6. Partial SBO (Small Bowel Obstruction) - The patient continues to tolerate tube feeding, and bowel regimen will be continued.

7. ICU Care - The patient is receiving ProBalance (full) nutrition at 45 mL/hour. Arterial line, midline catheter, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis are in place. A meeting will be set up with the patient's daughter for Code status discussion. The patient's current disposition is ICU, and she has spent a total of 40 hours in the ICU."

Her small bowel obstruction (SBO) seems to be improved. Over the past 24 hours, her ventilation has worsened, which may be related to sedation or increased dead space. Review of arterial blood gas (ABG) and ventilation parameters suggests respiratory depression from narcotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening ventilation and ABG results indicate a high risk of continued respiratory failure. The presence of multiple organisms on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the decision to treat only Pseudomonas with Zosyn for 14 days may increase the risk of complications if other organisms are not appropriately managed.
2. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be due to various factors, including sedation, pain, or delirium. The current regimen of Seroquel, celexa, Ativan, and oxycodone has been partially effective but may need to be adjusted to achieve better control of agitation.
3. Anasarca: The patient's"

   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD.
   s/p treatment for acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with bactrim and
   unasyn this admission. Now being treated with zosyn for pseudomonas
   pna.  CXR improved today.
   -check ABG now, based on this decrease Fi02 or PEEP.
   -Nebs
   -Continue diuresis
   -Push in trach further and repeat CXR, f/u with IP
   -Continue zosyn for [**9-13**] day course.
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -After many days effort at attempted diuresis, pt began briskly
   diuresing yesterday on lasix gtt and diuril.   Continue goal of at
   least 1L negative daily with lasix gtt as needed.
   -d/c diuril
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -pt
s creatinine improving, mobilizing fluid in what may represent
   post-atn autodiuresis.
   -monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, replete prn.
   -lasix gtt prn for UOP 100cc/hour.
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Difficult at present to establish pt
s mental
   status. Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since
   transfer to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on
   multiple sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component.  Yesterday pt
s olanzapine was increased, seroquel
   discontinued. Given higher basal fentanyl overnight with hope of
   decreasing bolus requirement and agitation breakthrough
s overnight.
   This morning pt
s mental status much improved. Is awake, responding to
   commands, seems aware of team.  Mouthing a few words.
   -Continue olanzapine
   -fenanyl gtt attempting to wean.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as above.

The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including MMP (Multifocal Pulmonary Neoplasm), tracheobroncheomalacia, hypoxic respiratory failure, CHF/Total body overload, acute renal failure (ARF), agitation/AMS/?Pain, hypertension (HTN), COPD, atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She has been sedated and unresponsive due to multiple sedating medications but is now responding well to fentanyl gtt and patch, indicating a possible pain component. The patient's mental status has improved in the morning. She has been on diuresis, and her fluid balance is being monitored. The patient has had episodes of hypoxia and respiratory failure, for which she was treated with intubation and tracheostomy. She is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with FiO2 of 50%. Her ABG results show a respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's history of tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, and COPD increases the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABG analysis is essential to adjust FiO2 and PEEP accordingly.
2. CHF/Total body overload: The patient's moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild LVH, and no focal wall"

   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD.
   s/p treatment for acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with bactrim and
   unasyn this admission. Now being treated with zosyn for pseudomonas
   pna.  Still requiring significant ventilatory support. Given
   improvement on CXR, pt not decompensating with no increased fevers, wbc
   or sputum production, will hold on broadening coverage at this time.
   ABG with slightly improved hypercarbia on lower fentanyl dosing.
   -Continue Zosyn for pseudomonas treatment, currently day 7.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and diuril
   -Nebs to Q4
   -Monitor pt
s sedation/RR/tidal volumes.  Wean PEEP if possible
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   -Continue diuresis as above, have recently increased gtt and diuril
   dose. Renal function has stayed stable. Goal neg 1 L today.
   -check [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing, ? substitution of metalozone for
   diuril per pharm.
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.
   -Renal consulted; appreciate input
   -holding off on re-adding home HCTZ and  ACEI for now.
   -renal function stable while diuresing.
   ## Partial SBO/illeus: Pt
s abd distention has improved s/p NGT
   placement. Pt is now stooling.  Process seems resolved.
   -Continue bowel regiment.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as below.
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Difficult at present to establish pt
s mental
   status. Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since
   transfer to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on
   multiple sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component.  (Source of potential pain not clear
abd NT as it was
   previously--? [**3-3**] trach).  Plan was to attempt to return pt to rehab
   doses of pain/anxiety/psych meds in order to better elucidate her
   mental status as compared to how she was at rehab.  However, for now,
   will con
t olanzapine w/ PRN dosing & if addition of PRN dosing not
   effective will dc that & start seroquel.
   -standing olanzapine (increase from [**Hospital1 **] to TID) w/ PRN doses for
   brkthrough agitation.
   -DC home dose seroquel for now (to avoid too many psych meds, partic as
   QTc borderline).  Hold on haldol for agitation.
   -continue fentanyl gtt with boluses as needed; however, may consider
   giving methadone 20mg IV x1 in place of fentanyl (per pharmacy) as this
   may eventually allow pt to be transitioned to methadone PO long term

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute kidney injury, partial small bowel obstruction, hypertension, and agitation with unclear mental status. She has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone various interventions and treatments. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require significant ventilatory support due to tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and COPD. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the ventilatory support is not optimized.
2. CHF/Total body overload: The patient has evidence of moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy with no focal wall motion abnormalities. There is a risk of worsening heart failure and fluid overload if diuresis is not appropriately managed.
3. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated blood urea nitrogen levels, which may be related to contrast nephropathy from a recent computed tomography angiography. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and further interventions may be required to support kidney function.
4. Partial SBO/Ileus: The patient had abdominal distention that improved after the placement of a nasogastric tube. However, there is still a risk of recurrent ileus or bowel ischemia, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. HTN: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 F chronic respiratory failure secondary to GBS and severe TBM, h/o
   infection with Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas admitted with recurrent
   hypoxic respiratory failure.  So far in her course, she has been
   treated for a RUL pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca.  Her SBO
   seems to be improved.  Over the past 24 hours, her ventilation seems to
   have worsened, which may be related to either sedation or increase dead
   space.  Review of ABG and Ve points toward respiratory depression from
   narcotics.
   1)       Respiratory failure
 Multiple organisms on BAL but elected to
   Rx only the Pseudomonas. We will complete course of therapy with Zosyn
   14 days.  Increase combivent to Q4H. Try to wean PEEP to 10. If
   decompensates will Rx Acinetobacter with high dose unasyn versus
   Meropenem (if sensitive). Will will adjust trach and clairfu with IP if
   they would like to follow up.
   2)       Agitation
 Previously had better mental status on regimen of
   Seroquel, celexa, Ativan and oxycodone at [**Hospital1 82**].  Started back on
   Seroqeul over weekend but also getting Zydis.  We have stopped
   Seroquel, standing Zydis. We will decrease fentanyl drip from 75 to 50
   and use bolus prn. Goals is to wean Fentanyl by 10-20% a day until off
   and prn only
   3)       Anasarca
 doing much better - Continue lasix, for goal I/O
   negative 500 cc to 1 L.
   4)       CRI
 Creatine improving with diruesis, slight contraction but
   we will press on for another day with lasix hold diuril
 and tremnd
   labs
   5)       HTN
 Correlates with agitation.  Continue clonidine,
   amlodipine.
   6)       Partial SBO -  Continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old obese male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and severe tuberculosis (TBM), along with previous infections with Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. The patient was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and has since been treated for a right upper lobe pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca. His small bowel obstruction (SBO) seems to be improved.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 180/67 to 210/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, tidal volume (Vt) of 640 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 33 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory depression from narcotics, with a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.0 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 398 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose (Gl"

   status. Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since
   transfer to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on
   multiple sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component.  Yesterday pt
s olanzapine was increased, seroquel
   discontinued. Given higher basal fentanyl overnight with hope of
   decreasing bolus requirement and agitation breakthrough
s overnight.
   This morning pt
s mental status much improved. Is awake, responding to
   commands, seems aware of team.  Mouthing a few words.
   -Continue olanzapine
   -fenanyl gtt attempting to wean.
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as above.
   ## COPD: Continue MDI

","The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), tracheobroncheomalacia, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has had various complications during her ICU stay, including airway obstruction, tracheal stenting, and removal of Y stent.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF)/total body overload, acute kidney injury (ARF), and agitation/acute mental status changes (?pain). The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, and COPD. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics for various infections.

The patient's renal function is impaired, and she has been on renal consult for acute renal failure (ARF), which is thought to be due to contrast nephropathy after a cardiac CT angiography (CTA). Her serum creatinine levels have been improving, and she is showing signs of autodiuresis.

The patient also has agitation and altered mental status, which has been difficult to manage. She has been on various sedating medications, including benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, but with limited success. Recently, her mental status has improved with the use of fentanyl and"

   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component; attempting to wean gtt with some success at this point.
   Olanzapine dose increased, seroquel discontinued.  This morning pt
   mental status continues to improve. Is awake, responding to commands,
   seems aware of team.  Mouthing a few words.
   -Continue olanzapine
   -fenanyl gtt, attempting to wean
   -continue aggressive bowel regimen with goal to have pt stool today
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as above.
   ## COPD: Continue MDI

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), agitation/acute mental status changes, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to tracheobroncheomalacia, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The patient has undergone several interventions such as tracheostomy, tracheal stenting, and tracheal revision. She has been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections, and is currently being treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia. 

Potential Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying condition of tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, and pulmonary edema puts her at risk for continued respiratory failure. Weaning off ventilator support will be crucial in her recovery.

2. CHF/Total body overload: The patient has evidence of systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and a moderately reduced ejection fraction. These findings suggest that she may have underlying heart failure. The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance and avoid excessive diuresis.

3. ARF: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. The cause could be pre-renal azotemia, intrinsic renal injury, or post-renal obstruction"

She has a history of infections with Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas. The patient was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated for right upper lobe pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca. Her small bowel obstruction (SBO) seems to have improved.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 119/42 to 196/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 502 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The results of arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis show a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 56 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 138 mmHg, oxygen consumption (VE) of 8.3 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 138"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and severe tuberculous meningitis (TBM). She has a history of infection with Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas. The patient was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated for a right upper lobe (RUL) pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca. Her small bowel obstruction (SBO) seems to have improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently being treated for a RUL pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be related to pain. She is currently receiving olanzapine and fentanyl for pain management.
3. Anasarca: The patient has diffuse anasarca and is showing improvement. However, there is a risk of fluid overload or renal dysfunction due to diuresis.
4. Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury (CRI): The patient had a suspected ATN from contrast exposure. There is a risk of worsening kidney function.
5. Hypertension (HTN): The patient has hypertension, which is likely related to agitation. She is being treated with clonidine and amlodipine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and severe tuberculosis (TBM). She has a history of infections with Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. The patient was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated for a right upper lobe (RUL) pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca. Her small bowel obstruction (SBO) seems to be improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which is secondary to GBS and severe TBM. She was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and treated for a RUL pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the current treatment does not effectively manage her condition or if she develops any new complications.

2) Infection: The patient has a history of infections with Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. While she is currently being treated for Pseudomonas infection, there is a possibility of developing new infections due to her weakened immune system and prolonged ICU stay.

3) Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be related to pain. This can increase the risk of complications such as self-injury, increased heart rate, and blood pressure. Proper management of pain and use of antipsychotic medication like olanzapine can help control agitation.

4) Anasarca: The patient has been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of ongoing cr improvement while off diuretics. The patient has been well overnight without agitation, on 25mcg fentanyl per hour with 2x 50mcg boluses. ABG showed improved oxygenation: 7.48/54/123, FiO2 decreased to 40%, pt desatted. ABG on 40% was: increased to 60%. The patient has allergies to aspirin and unknown. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 12:00 AM. The patient is currently on fentanyl infusion and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Lansoprazole (Prevacid) was started on 08:00 AM. The patient's medical and family history is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of 05:48 AM shows vital signs with Tmax at 37 degrees Celsius, Tcurrent at 36.7 degrees Celsius, HR at 63 bpm, BP at 117/43 mmHg, RR at 0 insp/min, and SpO2 at 98%. Heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 112.2 kg (admission: 114.5 kg) and height is 64 inches. Fluid balance shows total in of 1,879 mL, PO of 1,083 mL, IVF of 516 mL, blood products of 3,040 mL, and urine output of 3,040 mL. NG, stool, and drain outputs are not assessed. Respiratory support shows ventilator mode as CPAP/PSV, Vt (Set) at 450 mL, Vt (Spontaneous) at 420 mL, PS at 15 cmH2O, RR (Set) at 12, RR (Spontaneous) at 29, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and ABG results.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed. Labs show WBC at 8.5 K/uL, Hct at 24.7%, Plt at 398 K/uL, Cr at 2.1 mg/dL, TCO2 at 34 mmol/L, Glucose at 110 mg/dL, and other lab results as mentioned above. The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support indicates the use of CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 60%. This suggests the patient may be experiencing respiratory distress or difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation. The ABG results show improved oxygenation but desaturation during FiO2 decrease. This may indicate the need for close monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support to prevent further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a wide range of systolic blood pressure readings throughout the day (117/64-220/77 mmHg). This variability could suggest underlying cardiovascular instability or the need for careful monitoring of hemodynamic status to prevent cardiovascular complications such as hypotension or hypertension.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.1 mg"

   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Difficult at present to establish pt
s mental
   status. Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since
   transfer to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on
   multiple sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component; attempting to wean gtt with some success at this point.
   Olanzapine dose increased, seroquel discontinued.  This morning pt
   mental status continues to improve. Is awake, responding to commands,
   seems aware of team.  Mouthing a few words.
   -Continue olanzapine
   -fenanyl gtt, attempting to wean
   -continue aggressive bowel regimen; pt with bowel movement yesterday
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as above.
   ## COPD: Continue MDI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of multiple medical problems, including GBS, s/p tracheostomy with subsequent airway obstruction and repeated stenting. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and was treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections during this admission. She is now being treated with Zosyn for Pseudomonas pneumonia. Her volume status has improved.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, CHF/total body overload, acute renal failure (ARF), agitation/AMS/possible pain, hypertension (HTN), COPD, atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).

Plan:
- Continue Zosyn for an 11-13 day course.
- Attempt further weaning of vent settings, starting with pressure support.
- After many days of diuresis, the patient began briskly diuresing two days ago on Lasix gtt and Diuril. These medications have been discontinued, and progress will be trended. The goal remains 1L negative daily.
- Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
- Continue fentanyl gtt, attempting to wean.
- Continue olanzapine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a medical history of multifactorial pulmonary disease, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and COPD. She has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and has undergone tracheostomy revision and upgrade. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Her temperature is slightly elevated, but within normal limits. Her oxygen saturation is maintained at 98% with the use of supplemental oxygen.

The patient has had significant fluid overload, which has been addressed through diuretic therapy and aggressive fluid management. Her renal function has improved, and she is mobilizing fluid, indicating possible autodiuresis.

The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of agitation and unresponsiveness. She has been on various sedating medications, but fentanyl has shown to be most effective in managing her pain component. Her mental status continues to improve, and she is now awake, responding to commands, and aware of the healthcare team.

The patient has a history of hypertension, which is likely related to autonomic dysfunction secondary to diabetes mellitus. Her blood pressure is relatively stable, except during episodes of anxiety. She is currently on antihypertensive therapy with clonidine and amlodipine.

The patient also has a history of COPD, for which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and severe Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM). The patient has a history of infection with Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas. She was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and has since been treated for a right upper lobe (RUL) pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca.

The patient is currently on several medications including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), fentanyl, heparin sodium, lansoprazole (Prevacid), and others. She is also receiving nutritional support through ProBalance at 45 mL/hour.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/39-126/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. However, there are elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), total CO2 (TCO2), and lactic acid. The electrolyte levels are within normal range"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and severe Tuberculosis (TBM). She has a history of infection with Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas. The patient was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated for a right upper lobe (RUL) pneumonia and diuresed for diffuse anasarca. Her small bowel obstruction (SBO) seems to have improved.

24-hour Events:
The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) on day 7 showed a pH of 7.48, and her ventilator settings were adjusted accordingly. The patient is doing well today.

Medications:
The patient is receiving several medications including fentanyl for pain management, heparin sodium as prophylaxis, lansoprazole (Prevacid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and various other medications for different conditions.

Fluid Balance:
The patient has received a total of 1,879 mL of fluids since midnight, including 814 mL through the oral route, 1,083 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 516 mL through intravenous fluids. The patient has also had 3,040 mL of output including 795 mL of blood products and 3,040 mL of urine output.

Respiratory Support:
The patient is on a tracheostomy tube and"

 Previously had better mental status on regimen of
   Seroquel, celexa, Ativan and oxycodone at [**Hospital1 82**].  Started back on
   Seroqeul over weekend but also getting Zydis.  We have stopped
   Seroquel, standing Zydis. We will decrease fentanyl drip from 75 to 50
   and use bolus prn. Goals is to wean Fentanyl by 10-20% a day until off

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and severe Tuberculosis (TBM), who has been admitted multiple times with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and is completing a course of treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. The patient also has acute renal failure from suspected Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) due to contrast exposure, which is resolving. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving 45% FiO2. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure indicate an ongoing risk for respiratory failure. The current management with mechanical ventilation and antibiotics for Pseudomonas pneumonia is appropriate, but careful monitoring of oxygenation and weaning off ventilation support should be considered.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure from suspected ATN requires close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function. Proper hydration and diuresis should be maintained, and the underlying cause of ATN should be addressed.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation needs to be managed appropriately to prevent any complications such as self-extubation or increased sedation requirements. Pain control and medication adjustment may help in reducing agitation.
4. Anasarca: The patient's diffuse an"

   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of multifocal pulmonary disease, including tracheobroncheomalacia, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and subsequent tracheostomy revision. The patient's current condition shows improvement in volume status and continued treatment for pseudomonas pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying condition of tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and COPD contributes to her respiratory failure. Treatment involves Nebulizers, diuresis, and continued antibiotic therapy for pseudomonas pneumonia.

2. CHF/Total Body Overload: The patient has shown signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) with recent findings of moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Diuretic therapy has been initiated, and the goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 1 liter daily.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest acute renal failure, possibly due to contrast nephropathy following a recent computed tomography angiography (CTA). Renal consultation has been sought, and the patient's creatinine levels are improving.

4. Agitation/AMS/?Pain: The patient's mental status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of multi-morbidity including GBS, s/p tracheostomy with subsequent airway obstruction and repeated stenting, who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent Y stent removal, tracheostomy revision, and upgrade. She is slowly improving. The patient's conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, CHF/total body overload, acute renal failure (ARF), agitation/AMS/?pain, hypertension (HTN), COPD, atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further respiratory distress or deterioration due to underlying conditions such as tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, and COPD.
2. CHF/Total Body Overload: The patient may develop worsening congestive heart failure symptoms or fluid overload due to continued negative fluid balance and ongoing diuretic use.
3. ARF: The patient may experience a recurrence of acute renal failure, especially if there is a reoccurrence of contrast nephropathy or pre-renal azotemia.
4. Agitation/AMS/?Pain: The patient may continue to exhibit agitation or altered mental status due to underlying pain, anxiety, or medication effects.

   further diuresis leading to further vent weaning)
   -Continue Zosyn, [**12-14**] day course.

   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Difficult at present to establish pt
s mental
   status. Per daughter at rehab pt was communicative and awake.  Since
   transfer to our service she has been sedated and unresponsive on
   multiple sedating medications. She does become intermittently agitated,
   initially thought due to anxiety and was treated with BZD gtt and later
   prn boluses, however this did not seem to help her agitation and all
   bzds were held due to concerns about clouding mental status picture. Pt
   now on fentanyl gtt with patch and boluses as well as celexa.  Fentanyl
   seems to be most effective, suggesting perhaps more of a pain
   component; attempting to wean gtt with some success at this point.
   Olanzapine dose increased, seroquel discontinued.  This morning pt
   mental status continues to improve. Is awake, responding to commands,
   seems aware of team.  Mouthing a few words.
   -Continue olanzapine
   -fenanyl gtt, attempting to wean
   -continue aggressive bowel regimen
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as above.
   -Expect BPs to improve overall as fluid overload is decreased

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of multifocal pulmonary disease, including tracheobroncheomalacia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has undergone several tracheostomy procedures due to airway obstruction and has been on mechanical ventilation support. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, exacerbated by multifocal pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, and COPD. She has been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections with bactrim and Unasyn, respectively, and is now being treated for Pseudomonas PNA with Zosyn. The patient's volume status has improved, and she is responding well to diuretics.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulmonary edema and COPD. This condition requires close monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation parameters.
2. CHF/Total Body Overload: The patient has signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) with moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function was initially impaired, possibly due to contrast nephrop"

   unasyn this admission. Now being treated with zosyn for pseudomonas
   pna.  Volume status much improved.
   -Nebs
   -Resume diuretics PRN to maintain negative fluid balance (w/ hope of
   further diuresis leading to further vent weaning)
   -Continue Zosyn, 21/14 day course.
   -have been as of yet unable to wean Fi02, will continue to attempt as
   pt improves.
   -in setting of possibly worsened infiltrate on CXR will repeat sputum
   culture and CXR, consider adding unasyn/bactrim to cover
   stenotrophomonas/acinetobacter seen previously on culture if pt
   clinically decompensates/spikes.
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,

   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen with clonidine and
   amlodipine.
   -Predominant contributor to HTN is agitation/pain, treat as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of Multifocal Motor Peripheral Neuropathy (MMP) and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent tracheostomy revision and upgrade, and is slowly improving. The patient has multiple medical issues including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), agitation/acute mental status changes (?pain), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying condition of tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, pulmonary edema, and COPD contribute to her hypoxic respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation are crucial to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Infection: The patient has been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections during this admission. There is a possibility of developing new infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged intubation. Repeat sputum cultures and chest X-rays will help identify any new infections.
3. CHF/Total body overload: The patient has evidence of congestive heart failure with moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension. It is"

   79yo woman with respiratory failure, Pseudomonas pneumonia and ARF [**3-3**]
   ATN.
   1)      Respiratory failure
 Multiple organisms on BAL but elected to
   treat only the Pseudomonas. We will complete course of therapy with
   Zosyn 14 days. Continue combivent to Q4H. Continue to wean vent as
   tolerated. Still with a slightly increased oxygen requirement. Will
   recheck chest x-ray tomorrow given slightly increased RML opacity
   compared to [**9-27**] film. Currently day 12 of 14 of Zosyn.
   2)      Agitation
 Improved off pain meds. Better even from yesterday.
   Answering questions appropriately today. Changing Fentanyl gtt to
   boluses appear to help.
   3)       Anasarca
 doing better - continue lasix, for goal negative  1
   L.
   4)       CRI
 Creatine improving with diruesis, slight contraction
   will continue with lasix. ATN recovering with supportive care and
   continued diuresis.
   5)       HTN
 Correlates with agitation.  Continue clonidine,
   amlodipine. Currently well-controlled.
   6)       Partial SBO -  Resolved; continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel
   regimen.
   7)     COPD: Continue nebs. Lung exam stable.
   8)     F/E/N: TFs at goal. Follow/replete
lytes as needed.
   9)     Code: full; access: mid-line; prophylaxis: heparin subQ / PPI;
   dispo: MICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure due to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and severe tuberculous meningitis (TBM). She has undergone tracheostomy and has a history of infection with Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. The patient was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure. She developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and acute kidney injury (AKI) from contrast exposure, which is now resolving. The patient's arterial line was removed last night. She has allergies to aspirin and is currently receiving lasix infusion, heparin subcutaneously, and other medications as needed.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: she has no known mucus or gastrointestinal symptoms.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F) and 36.5°C (97.7°F)
- Heart rate: 55 bpm with sinus bradycardia
- Blood pressure: 119/54 mmHg and 95/44 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's current weight is 112.2 kg, and her height is 64 inches. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 1,870 mL and output of 1,745 mL. Her urine output has been 1,060 mL. The patient's blood products and drainages are noted below.

Respiratory Support:
The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 460 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 45%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH 7.46, PaCO2 52 mmHg, PaO2 144, and HCO3- 65 mEq/L. Her respiratory support device is an endotracheal tube, and her spontaneous respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute.

Physical Examination:
The patient is alert, oriented, and comfortable. Her tracheostomy site is clean. She has soft heart sounds with regular rhythm and rate without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Her lungs are clear bilaterally without crackles or wheezing. The patient is obese and refuses abdominal examination. She has 2+ lower extremity edema. Her neurologic examination shows that she arouses easily to voice, answers questions appropriately, and is interactive.

Lab Results:
The patient's laboratory values include the following:
- Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 24.6%
- White blood cell count: 8.0 x 103/mm3

   Assessment and Plan
   1)       Respiratory failure
 Multiple organisms on BAL but elected to
   Rx only the Pseudomonas. We will complete course of therapy with Zosyn
   14 days. Continue combivent to Q4H. Continue to wean vent.
   2)       Agitation
 Improved off pain meds.
   3)       Anasarca
 doing much better - Continue lasix, for goal
   negative  1 L.
   4)       CRI
 Creatine improving with diruesis, slight contraction
   will continue with lasix
   5)       HTN
 Correlates with agitation.  Continue clonidine,
   amlodipine.
   6)       Partial SBO -  Resolved continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel
   regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and severe tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). She has undergone tracheostomy and has a history of infection with Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. The patient was admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and pseudomonal pneumonia. ARF from suspected ATN due to contrast has been resolving. The patient's FiO2 was increased to 45% due to low oxygen saturation levels.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/54 to 131/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set FiO2 of 45%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 26 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and respiratory system resistance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 144.

The patient's physical examination reveals general obesity, clean tracheostomy site, soft heart sounds with regular rhythm, no murmurs or gallops appreciated, anterior exam without crackles or wheezing, and 2+ lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows that the patient arouses to voice, answers questions appropriately, and is interactive.

Laboratory results indicate elevated leukocyte count (WBC) at 8.0 K/uL, slightly low hematocrit (Hct) at 24.6%, and normal platelet count (Plt) at 49,000/mm3. Kidney function tests reveal an elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL. Other lab results include normal electrolytes, liver function tests, amylase, lipase, lactate, albumin, and calcium levels. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 44 mg/dL.

The assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for respiratory failure with continued Combivent nebulizer every 4 hours, weaning of mechanical ventilation as tolerated, and completion of the course of Zosyn therapy for pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient's agitation has improved, and she is answering questions appropriately. Fentanyl administration has been changed to boluses, which seem to help. The patient's anasarca is improving with the use of Lasix for goal negative 1 L fluid balance. ATN is recovering with supportive care and continued diuresis. The patient's hypertension is being managed with clonidine and amlodipine. Partial small bowel obstruction has resolved, and the patient is tolerating enteral feeds at goal. COPD management includes the continuation of nebulizers. Other plans include glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of multifactorial pulmonary issues, including tracheobroncheomalacia, previous pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and has undergone tracheostomy revision and upgrade. The patient is slowly improving but still requires respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes tracheobroncheomalacia, PNA, pulmonary edema, and COPD. The patient is currently being treated with Zosyn for pseudomonas PNA. Continuous efforts are being made to wean off FiO2 and eventually remove the tracheostomy.

2. CHF/Total Body Overload: The patient has signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) with moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 1L daily.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function was initially impaired, possibly due to contrast nephropathy from a recent computed tomography angiography (CTA). However, renal function is now improving, and the patient is mobilizing fluid, suggesting post-acute tubular necrosis autodiuresis.

She was previously treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections with bactrim and Unasyn, respectively, and is now being treated with Zosyn for pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient's volume status has improved, and she is receiving nebulized bronchodilators, diuretics as needed, and continuous IV fluids.

The patient's renal function is improving, with a decreasing serum creatinine level. She is also showing signs of post-renal autodiuresis. The plan is to continue monitoring her electrolytes and replete them as needed.

The patient's agitation and possible delirium have improved as sedation has been weaned down. She will be closely monitored for any signs of agitation or pain, and fentanyl boluses will be given as needed. Olanzapine and citalopram will also be continued.

The patient's blood pressure is relatively hypotensive, except during periods of anxiety, when it rises to the 200s.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of allergies to aspirin and unknown allergies. The patient is receiving various medications, including furosemide, lansoprazole, fentanyl, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/50 to 137/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is intubated through a tracheostomy tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 527 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 45%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 26 cmH2O, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. His blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.9 g/dL, pCO2 of 126 mg/dL, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 36 mEq/L, base excess of -45 mg/dL, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,859 mL, including 575 mL of oral intake, 1,083 mL of tube feeding, and 536 mL of intravenous fluids. The output includes 2,540 mL of urine and 681 mL of drain output. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 398 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 7.9 g/dL, glucose at 141 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin (Tbili) at 24.2 %, potassium (K+) at 4.2 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) at 126 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 98 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) at 7.7 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 2.2 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) at 3.5 mg/dL, and lactic acid at 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's differential white blood cell count shows neutrophils at 88.4%, lymphocytes at 6.2%, monocytes at 3.2%, eosinophils at 2.0%, and basophils at 0.4%. Other lab results include albumin at 2.6 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 192 IU/L, and amylase/lipase levels within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake-output mismatch, indicating the need for further evaluation and management.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection that requires further investigation.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is within the normal range, but careful monitoring is necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.
7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible renal dysfunction.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium and sodium levels are within the normal range, but other electrolyte levels, such as magnesium and phosphate, are abnormal and require close monitoring and management.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the patient's exact condition and appropriate interventions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of multifactorial pulmonary disease, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy revision and upgrade, Y stent removal, and treatment for various infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is hypoxic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. The underlying causes include tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and COPD. The patient's slow improvement suggests ongoing efforts to manage her respiratory status.
2. CHF/Total Body Overload: The patient has evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) and total body overload. This is indicated by recent findings of moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), no focal wall motion abnormalities, and a slightly depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. The goal remains to achieve a negative fluid balance daily and retry lasix gtt today while tolerating relative hypotension in the 90s.
3. ARF: The patient is considered to have acute renal failure (ARF), which is believed to be post-contrast acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It has not resolved, indicating"

   79F with MMP, including h/o GBS, s/p trach with subsequent airway
   obstruction and repeated stenting, who p/w hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Now s/p Y stent removal, trach revision, and trach upgrade.
   Slowly improving.
   ## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial including
   tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD.
   s/p treatment for acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with bactrim and
   unasyn this admission. Now being treated with zosyn for pseudomonas
   pna.  Volume status much improved.
   -Nebs
   -Resume diuretics PRN to maintain negative fluid balance (w/ hope of
   further diuresis leading to further vent weaning)
   -Continue Zosyn, [**1-13**] day course.
   -have been as of yet unable to wean FiO2, will continue to attempt as
   pt improves.
   -in setting of possibly worsened infiltrate on CXR will repeat sputum
   culture and CXR, consider adding unasyn/bactrim to cover
   stenotrophomonas/acinetobacter seen previously on culture if pt
   clinically decompensates/spikes.
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   - Goal remains 1L negative daily.
   ## ARF: FeUrea not c/w pre-renal azotemia.  Timing of ARF c/w possible
   contrast nephropathy s/p CTA.  Renal function now much improved,
   nearing baseline.  Good UOP.
   -Renal consulted and has now signed off.
   -pt

   post-atn autodiuresis.
   -monitor lytes, replete prn
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Much improved as sedation weaned down. Will be
   minimizing benzos.
   -continue fentanyl boluses prn pain/agitation
   -olanzapine

   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive except for periods of anxiety, when SBP
   rises as high as 200s. This may be due to GBS and or autonomic
   dysfunction in the setting of DM. Would work to avoid extreme
   hypertension so as to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   -Clonidine d/c

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of multifactorial pulmonary disease, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections during this admission. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Her volume status has improved, and she is being weaned off sedatives. The goal is to maintain negative fluid balance and continue diuretics as needed. She is also being treated with Zosyn for pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient's renal function has improved, and she is nearing baseline. Her blood pressure remains relatively controlled, but there are periods of hypertension during anxiety. Pain and agitation are being managed with fentanyl boluses. The patient's diabetes is being managed with Lantus and ISS. Her nutrition is being provided through a ProBalance solution. The patient's code status remains as full code, and her disposition is to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and COPD. Continued management is necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has previously had infections with Acinetobacter and Stenotroph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with an unknown chief complaint. They have been in the ICU for an extended period of time, as evidenced by the multiple dates mentioned in the note. The patient attempted weaning from the ventilator but experienced agitation and hypertension, so they were returned to original settings. Amlodipine was discontinued to allow for additional blood pressure room for diuresis. The patient is on various medications including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, fentanyl, and others. They have a history of allergies to aspirin.

Vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/44 to 153/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 114.5 kg to 112.2 kg during their ICU stay. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,786 mL and output of 2,085 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -299 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 55%.

","Summary:
The patient is an obese, chronically ill woman in the ICU. She has a history of gastroenteritis, sepsis, and tracheobroncheomalacia. She is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections with Bactrim and Unasyn, and is now being treated with Zosyn for pseudomonas pneumonia. Her volume status has improved.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and COPD. Treatment involves nebulizers, aggressive diuresis, weaning off the ventilator as tolerated, and monitoring for sputum cultures and chest X-ray results.
2. CHF/Total Body Overload: Recent echocardiography showed moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, no focal wall motion abnormalities, and a normal to slightly depressed ejection fraction of 45%. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1L daily. Lasix will be continued and may be uptitrated, and diurel may be added if necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is considered to have"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including Lasix infusion, Piperacillin, and Tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/48 to 150/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 45%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1959 mL and total output of 2355 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -396 mL. The patient's recent laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and fever suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory support and ABG values may indicate the development of ARDS. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with multifactorial hypoxic respiratory failure, including tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has undergone tracheostomy with subsequent airway obstruction and repeated stenting. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections during this admission. She is now being treated with Zosyn for Pseudomonas pneumonia. Her volume status has improved.

The patient also has congestive heart failure (CHF) and total body overload, with recent findings of moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. The goal remains to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 liter per day. 

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), which is considered to be post-contrast acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and has not resolved. She has been sedated, but agitation has improved as sedation has been weaned down. 

Other conditions include hypertension (HTN), COPD, atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been in the mid-20s throughout admission, with no evidence of bleeding or hemolysis. Oral"

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo woman with respiratory failure, Pseudomonas pneumonia and ARF [**3-3**]
   ATN.
   1)      Acute on chronic respiratory failure
 Multiple organisms on
   sputum cultures but elected to treat only the Pseudomonas. Completed
   Zosyn 14 days today. Continue combivent Q4H. Continue to wean vent as
   tolerated. Wean FiO2 as tolerated. Not treating Acinetobacter or
   Stenotropamonas. Remains afebrile without leukocytosis. She is
   chronically colonized with multiple gram-negative pathogens, no plans
   treat unless she develops an infiltrate on chest imaging, or frankly
   positive cultures.   Will Check chest x-ray today.
   2)      Agitation
 Answering questions appropriately over the past
   several days; continue to minimize sedation / analgesia and avoid
   drips. Would prefer to avoid benzos and use anti-psychotics for anxiety
   / agitation.
   3)       Anasarca
 She continues to go on and off lasix gtt given
   borderline BPs. Have d/c
ed clonidine and amlodipine in an effort to
   allow more BP for diuresis. Goal remains net negative 1 liter on a
   daily basis. If she cannot stay on the lasix gtt, need to consider
   intermittent boluses and/or other diuretics. If her BP cannot tolerate
   this, then considering pressors to allow for adequate diuresis may be
   needed.
   4)     ARF / CRI
 Creatinine stable.
   5)       Partial SBO
 Resolved; continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel
   regimen.
   6)     COPD
 Continue nebs. Will attempt to decrease FiO2 as above.
   Plan for another SBT today; she may not be able to
           complete wean from the vent during this hospitalization. [**Month (only) 60**]
   need to consider d/c
ing her to a long-term vent facility.
   7)     F/E/N: TFs at goal. Follow/replete lytes as needed.
          8)      Heme: Hct trending down, 22.8% today. Will add FeSO4;
   goal transfusion is >21%. No e/o acute blood loss.
   9)     Code: full; access: mid-line; prophylaxis: heparin subQ / PPI;
   dispo: Will have screened for rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and severe Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM). She has a history of infection with Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. The patient is currently admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) and Pseudomonas pneumonia. She is on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to GBS and TBM, and her condition is currently exacerbated. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not managed appropriately.
2. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient is being treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia, but there is a risk of antibiotic resistance or recurrence of infection if not fully eradicated.
3. ATN: The patient has ATN, which can lead to acute kidney injury and impaired renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters is necessary.
4. Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema, known as anasarca, which may complicate fluid management and diuresis. Careful monitoring of fluid balance is required.
5. Agitation: The patient has shown signs of agitation, and minimizing sedation/analgesia is recommended. However, there is a risk of increased anxiety or agitation if not"

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo woman with respiratory failure, Pseudomonas pneumonia and ARF [**3-3**]
   ATN.
   1)      Acute on chronic respiratory failure
 Multiple organisms on
   sputum cultures but elected to treat only the Pseudomonas. Completed
   Zosyn 14 days today. Continue combivent Q4H. Continue to wean vent as
   tolerated. Wean FiO2 as tolerated. Not treating Acinetobacter or
   Stenotropamonas. Remains afebrile without leukocytosis. She is
   chronically colonized with multiple gram-negative pathogens, no plans
   treat unless she develops an infiltrate on chest imaging, or frankly
   positive cultures.   Will Check chest x-ray today.
   2)      Agitation
 Answering questions appropriately over the past
   several days; continue to minimize sedation / analgesia and avoid
   drips. Would prefer to avoid benzos and use anti-psychotics for anxiety
   / agitation.
   3)       Anasarca
 She continues to go on and off lasix gtt given
   borderline BPs. Have d/c
ed clonidine and amlodipine in an effort to
   allow more BP for diuresis. Goal remains net negative 1 liter on a
   daily basis. If she cannot stay on the lasix gtt, need to consider
   intermittent boluses and/or other diuretics. If her BP cannot tolerate
   this, then considering pressors to allow for adequate diuresis may be
   needed.
   4)     ARF / CRI
 Creatinine stable.
   5)       Partial SBO
 Resolved; continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel
   regimen.
   6)     COPD
 Continue nebs. Will attempt to decrease FiO2 as above.
   Plan for another SBT today; she may not be able to
           complete wean from the vent during this hospitalization. [**Month (only) 60**]
   need to consider d/c
ing her to a long-term vent facility.
   7)     F/E/N: TFs at goal. Follow/replete lytes as needed.
          8)      Heme: Hct trending down, 22.8% today. Will add FeSO4;
   goal transfusion is >21%. No e/o acute blood loss.
   9)     Code: full; access: mid-line; prophylaxis: heparin subQ / PPI;
   dispo: Will have screened for rehab.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 79-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure due to GBS and severe TBM, post tracheostomy, history of infection with Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas.
- Admitted with recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure, ATN, and pseudomonal pneumonia.
- Currently weaning from vent, on Lasix drip, and various other medications.
- Improved interaction and answering questions appropriately.
- Recent events include resolving ARF from contrast-induced ATN, resolving partial small bowel obstruction, and stable creatinine levels.
- Other medical conditions include COPD, anasarca, and possible long-term ventilation needs.
- Lab results show stable kidney function, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and normal electrolyte levels.
- Plan to continue weaning from the ventilator, decrease FiO2 as tolerated, and consider discharge to a long-term vent facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Prolonged ventilation dependence and possible need for long-term ventilation facility.
3. Development of further infections, especially considering chronic colonization with multiple gram-negative pathogens.
4. Fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances due to anasarca and diuretic use.
5. Complications related to chronic kidney disease, such as worsening renal function or fluid retention.
6. Possible need for additional interventions, such as blood transfusions or pressors to manage blood pressure during diures"

ed clonidine and amlodipine in an effort to
   allow more BP for diuresis. Goal remains net negative 1 liter on a
   daily basis. If she cannot stay on the lasix gtt, need to consider
   intermittent boluses and/or other diuretics. If her BP cannot tolerate
   this, then considering pressors to allow for adequate diuresis may be
   needed.
   4)     ARF / CRI
 Creatinine stable.
   5)       Partial SBO
 Resolved; continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel
   regimen.
   6)     COPD
 Continue nebs. Will attempt to decrease FiO2 as above.
   Plan for another SBT today; she may not be able to
           complete wean from the vent during this hospitalization. [**Month (only) 60**]
   need to consider d/c
ing her to a long-term vent facility.
   7)     F/E/N: TFs at goal. Follow/replete
lytes as needed.
          8)      Heme: Hct trending down, 22.8% today. Will add FeSO4;
   goal transfusion is >21%. No e/o acute blood loss.
   9)     Code: full; access: mid-line; prophylaxis: heparin subQ / PPI;

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. On admission, his vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 161/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and receiving CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. His fluid balance shows an intake of 1,962 mL (718 mL PO, 647 mL IVF) and an output of 2,355 mL (1,720 mL urine). The patient's weight has decreased from 114.5 kg at admission to 105.3 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 6.7 to 10.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.5 to 1.6 mg/dL, hyperglycemia with blood glucose levels ranging from 82 to 155 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 20/14). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and multiple medical conditions. She was initially admitted with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and treated for Stenotrophomonas and Acinetobacter infections. The patient returned with respiratory failure due to tracheostomy stent narrowing and pneumonia. She completed a 14-day course of Zosyn for pseudomonas pneumonia on 10/2. The hospital course was complicated by post-contrast nephropathy, which has resolved, and anasarca, for which she was on Lasix.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient's condition has been monitored closely. She has shown improvement but still requires ventilator support. The patient's hearing has decreased, leading to concerns about loop diuretic-induced ototoxicity. Her fluid balance has been closely monitored, and diuretic dosages have been adjusted accordingly. The patient's sedation has been weaned down, and she is now alert and responsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing ongoing hypoxic respiratory failure, which may be caused by tracheobroncheomalacia, multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections and completed a course of Zosyn for pseudomonas"

   presented with VAP, treated for stenotrophomonas and acinetobacter and
   discharged. Returned with respiratory failure believed to be a
   combination of trach stent narrowing and pneumonia.  Initially treated

   79yo woman with respiratory failure, Pseudomonas pneumonia and ARF [**3-3**]
   ATN.
   1)      Acute on chronic respiratory failure
 Multiple organisms on
   sputum cultures but elected to treat only the Pseudomonas. Completed
   Zosyn 14 days [**2103-10-2**]. Continue combivent Q4H. Continue to wean vent as
   tolerated. Wean FiO2 as tolerated. She is chronically colonized with
   multiple gram-negative pathogens.
   - requiring suctioning q2-3h, WBC rising, but her CXR today did not
   show a new or worsened infiltrate ->concern for development of
   recurrent VAP.  Will start inhaled colistin which might be a better
   long term solution for her.
   2)      Agitation
 Answering questions appropriately over the past
   several days; continue to minimize sedation / analgesia and avoid
   drips. Would prefer to avoid benzos and use anti-psychotics for anxiety
   / agitation.
   3)      Anasarca
 Will hold lasix for now as CXR does not demonstrate
   pulmonary edema.  Appears to be autodiuresing as net negative since
   midnight without lasix.
   4)      HTN:  Restart home antihypertensives slowly.  Would start back
   amlodipine today.
   5)     ARF / CRI
 Creatinine stable.
   6)       Partial SBO
 Resolved; continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel
   regimen.
   7)     COPD
 Continue nebs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure and multiple episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She was admitted to the MICU with acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, pain relievers, and blood thinners. Her current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute and blood pressure of 146/51 mmHg. She is receiving supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 45%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 33 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.5 K/uL and elevated lactate levels. The patient's imaging shows a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray (CXR), which has been stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VAP: The patient's rising WBC count and previous history of VAP raise concerns for the development of recurrent VAP. The presence"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure and multiple episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She was admitted to the MICU with acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been diuresing on Lasix, but it was held overnight due to diminished hearing. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/46-146/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 0.45.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF not on
   anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia, DM, who has
   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.       Vent-Associated Pneumonia.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP yesterday, but now has rising temperatures, WBC and thick
   secretions, concerning for ongoing vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR
   appears unchanged.  Previous sputum sample on [**9-30**] showed pseudomonas
   and GNRs.  On [**9-30**], sputum grew pseudomonas sensitive only to amikacin
   and Zosyn.  Will empirically treat for VAP while awaiting sputum
   culture results with Colistin.
   -            initiate colisitin (Day 1 = [**2103-10-2**])
   -            f/u sputum culture
   -            follow fever curve and WBC
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Respiratory failure is multifactorial
   due to recurrent vent-associated pneumonia, tracheobroncheomalacia s/p
   Y-stent placement, and COPD.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn on
   [**10-2**], but will initiate colistin today given concern of ongoing
   pneumonia.  CXR does not show evidence of CHF so will discontinue lasix
   drip.
   -            daily CXR
   -            f/u sputum cultures
   -            continue standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -            stop aggressive diuresis given lack of evidence of
   pulmonary edema
   -            titrate FiO2 if possible
   3.       Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis.  Lasix
   drip was held yesterday due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given the lack
   of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, will discontinue to
   lasix drip.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg since
   admission and is negative 8.5L for LOS.   Patient may no longer require
   diuretics since there has been improvement of her renal function.
   -            goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   -            follow daily weights and Is/Os
   4.        ARF.  Patient had baseline Cr of 0.9.  Cr rose to 2.5 in
   setting of contrast nephropathy, but renal function has improved and Cr
   now stable for several days at 1.5.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          follow Cr
   5.        HTN.  Patient
s bloopd pressure has ranged from 110s to 170s
   systolic over the past 24 hours.  Antihypertensives were being held to
   give room for lasix diuresis.  Now that patient is off lasix drip, will
   slowly add back antihypertensives.  At home, patient takes hydralazine
   10 mg q8hr, Nitropaste q6hours, lopressor 37.5 q8hrs, HCTZ 12.5 mg
   daily, and Norvasc 10 mg daily.
   -          start amlodipine
   -          follow BP
   6.        COPD. Continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   7.       Paroxysmal A. fib.  Now is NSR.  Not anticoagulated due to GIB
   last month.
   8.       Type 2 DM.  Continue RISS and glargine qhs.
   9.       Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No
   evidence bleeding or hemolysis, though patient has history of GIB due
   to diverticulosis and hemorrhoids during last admission.
   -          continue ferrous gluconate
   -          monitor hct
   10.    Agitation.  Patient was previously agitated earlier in MICU
   stay, but now appropriate and answering questions.  Mental status is
   improved.  Will minimize mind altering meds.
                  -  continue fentanyl boluses prn pain/agitation
                  -  olanzapine
                  -  celexa

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and anemia. She has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in place. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: The patient has completed 14 days of Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for VAP, but she is showing signs of ongoing infection such as rising temperatures, white blood cell count, and thick secretions. A previous sputum sample showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive only to amikacin and Zosyn. The patient will be empirically treated for VAP with Colistin while awaiting sputum culture results.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including recurrent VAP, tracheobroncheomalacia with Y-stent placement, and COPD. Despite completing 14 days of Zosyn, there is concern for ongoing pneumonia, and the patient will be started on Colistin. The CXR does not show evidence of congestive heart failure, so the Lasix drip will be discontinued.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and multiple stents for Total Mammary Infiltration and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). She initially presented with VAP, treated for Stenotrophomonas and Acinetobacter, and was discharged. She returned with respiratory failure believed to be a combination of tracheostomy stent narrowing and pneumonia. She was treated again for Stenotrophomonas and Acinetobacter. Now she has completed a course of Zosyn for Pseudomonas PNA on [**10-2**]. Her hospital course was complicated by post-contrast nephropathy, which is now resolved. She also had anasarca and was on Lasix gtt.

In the past 24 hours, her Lasix gtt was increased to try to accelerate diuresis, with a loss of 1.8 liters. The patient reported decreased hearing, and the Lasix gtt was stopped due to concern for ototoxicity. She attempted to decrease FiO2 to 40%, but desaturated, so it was increased back to 45%.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF not on
   anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia, DM, who has
   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP yesterday, but now has rising temperatures, WBC and thick
   secretions, concerning for ongoing vent-associated pneumonia.  Previous
   sputum sample Multifactorial including tracheobroncheomalacia,
   multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD. S/p treatment for
   acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with Bactrim and Unasyn this
   admission. Completed 14 day course of zosyn for pseudomonas PNA on
   [**10-2**].   Continues to make purulent secretions. Unclear what bugs in
   sputum are pathogens vs colonization in this chronically vented
   patient.
   -Continue to monitor clinically and radiographically, if decompensates,
   re-start abx for VAP, tailoring to sputum speciation/senses.
   -Nebs
   -Diurese as able.
   -Continue to wean vent as tolerated
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -will check CXR daily
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   - Goal remains 1L negative daily, was ~1.8L negative yesterday after
   increasing lasix gtt, however now patient c/o hearing loss that is
   concerning for loop diuretic induced ototoxicity.
   - Hold diuresis today, monitor I/Os and auditory acuity.  If further
   diuresis needed, consider diuril.
   ## ARF: Considered to be post-contrast ATN, no resolved.
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Much improved as sedation weaned down. Will be
   minimizing benzos.
   -continue fentanyl boluses prn pain/agitation
   -olanzapine
   -celexa
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives to
   allow for more diuresis.
   ## COPD: Continue Combivent MDIs
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month, currently in sinus
   rhythm
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS/Lantus
   ## Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No evidence
   bleeding or hemolysis.  Slightly down from 24 to 22 today.  Was iron
   deficient in 7/[**2103**].
   -Added on oral iron repletion.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation, and diabetes mellitus. The patient has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in place and is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has completed a 14-day course of Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for VAP yesterday but continues to show signs of infection, including rising temperatures, white blood cell count, and thick secretions. This suggests ongoing VAP. The patient has previously been treated for Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas infections with Bactrim and Unasyn during this admission.

The patient's recent sputum sample showed the presence of Pseudomonas and GNRs (Gram-negative rods), which are common pathogens associated with VAP. The patient's chronic ventilation status makes it difficult to distinguish between pathogens and colonization.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Continue to monitor clinically and radiographically. If the patient decompensates, restart antibiotics for VAP and tailor treatment based on sputum speciation/sensitivity.
2. CHF/Total body overload: The patient has moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension, mild left ventricular hypertrophy with no"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF not on
   anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia, DM, who has
   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.       Vent-Associated Pneumonia.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP yesterday, but now has rising temperatures, WBC and thick
   secretions, concerning for ongoing vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR
   appears unchanged.  Previous sputum sample on [**9-30**] showed pseudomonas
   and GNRs.  On [**9-30**], sputum grew pseudomonas sensitive only to amikacin
   and Zosyn.  Will empirically treat for VAP while awaiting sputum
   culture results with Colistin.
          -       initiate colisitin (Day 1 = [**2103-10-2**])
   -          f/u sputum culture
   -          follow fever curve and WBC
   2.  Respiratory failure.  Respiratory failure is multifactorial due to
   recurrent vent-associated pneumonia, tracheobroncheomalacia s/p Y-stent
   placement, and COPD.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn on [**10-2**], but
   will initiate colistin today given concern of ongoing pneumonia.  CXR
   does not show evidence of CHF so will discontinue lasix drip.
   - daily CXR
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - continue standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - stop aggressive diuresis given lack of evidence of pulmonary edema
   - continue current vent settings
   3.  Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis.  Lasix
   drip was held yesterday due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given the lack
   of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, will discontinue to
   lasix drip.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg since
   admission and is negative 8.5L for LOS.   Patient may no longer require
   diuretics since there has been improvement of her renal function.
   - goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   - follow daily weights and Is/Os
   4.   ARF: Considered to be post-contrast ATN, no resolved.
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Much improved as sedation weaned down. Will be
   minimizing benzos.
   -continue fentanyl boluses prn pain/agitation
   -olanzapine
   -celexa
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives to
   allow for more diuresis.
   ## COPD: Continue Combivent MDIs
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month, currently in sinus
   rhythm
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS/Lantus
   ## Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No evidence
   bleeding or hemolysis.  Slightly down from 24 to 22 today.  Was iron
   deficient in 7/[**2103**].
   -Added on oral iron repletion.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements.

The patient initially presented with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Stenotrophomonas and Acinetobacter, for which she received treatment. She was discharged but returned with respiratory failure due to a combination of tracheostomy stent narrowing and pneumonia. She was again treated for Stenotrophomonas and Acinetobacter before being placed on a course of Zosyn for Pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient also experienced post-contrast nephropathy, which has since resolved. She had anasarca and was on Lasix drip. The Lasix drip was increased to promote diuresis, but it was stopped due to concerns of ototoxicity. The patient's hearing returned to baseline after stopping the Lasix drip.

The patient attempted to decrease FiO2 to 40% but desaturated, so it was increased back to 45%. A screening process was initiated, and the patient has a bed available at Radius LTAC.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 148/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals chronic illness, obesity, and anasarca. Her neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures have shown the presence of Pseudomonas and GNRs. The patient's creatinine level is stable, and other lab values are within normal ranges.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Vent-Associated Pneumonia: The patient completed 14 days of Zosyn for VAP but still has rising temperatures, WBC, and thick secretions, suggesting ongoing VAP. The patient will be empirically treated for VAP with Colistin while awaiting sputum culture results.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial due to recurrent VAP, tracheobroncheomalacia after Y-stent placement, and COPD. The patient will continue current ventilator settings.

3. Congestive Heart"

   complicated by multiple stents for TMB and multiple VAPs. Initially
   presented with VAP, treated for stenotrophomonas and acinetobacter and
   discharged. Returned with respiratory failure believed to be a
   combination of trach stent narrowing and pneumonia.  Initially treated
   again for stenotrophomonas and acinetomacter.  Now just completed
   course of zosyn for pseudomonas PNA on [**10-2**].  Hospital course
   complicated by post-contrast nephropathy now resolved. Also anasarca

   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.       Vent-Associated Pneumonia.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP yesterday, but now has rising temperatures, WBC and thick
   secretions, concerning for ongoing vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR
   appears unchanged.  Previous sputum sample on [**9-30**] showed pseudomonas
   and GNRs.  On [**9-30**], sputum grew pseudomonas sensitive only to amikacin
   and Zosyn.  Will empirically treat for VAP while awaiting sputum
   culture results with Colistin.
   -            initiate colisitin (Day 1 = [**2103-10-2**])
   -            f/u sputum culture
   -            follow fever curve and WBC
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Respiratory failure is multifactorial
   due to recurrent vent-associated pneumonia, tracheobroncheomalacia s/p
   Y-stent placement, and COPD.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn on
   [**10-2**], but will initiate colistin today given concern of ongoing
   pneumonia.  CXR does not show evidence of CHF so will discontinue lasix
   drip.
   -            daily CXR
   -            f/u sputum cultures
   -            continue standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -            stop aggressive diuresis given lack of evidence of
   pulmonary edema
   -            continue current vent settings
   3.       Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis.  Lasix
   drip was held yesterday due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given the lack
   of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, will discontinue to
   lasix drip.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg since
   admission and is negative 8.5L for LOS.   Patient may no longer require
   diuretics since there has been improvement of her renal function.
   -            goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   -            follow daily weights and Is/Os
   4.        ARF.  Patient had baseline Cr of 0.9.  Cr rose to 2.5 in
   setting of contrast nephropathy, but renal function has improved and Cr
   now stable for several days at 1.5.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          follow Cr
   5.        HTN.  Patient
s bloopd pressure has ranged from 110s to 170s
   systolic over the past 24 hours.  Antihypertensives were being held to
   give room for lasix diuresis.  Now that patient is off lasix drip, will
   slowly add back antihypertensives.
   -          start amlodipine
   -          follow BP
   6.        COPD. Continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   7.       Paroxysmal A. fib.  Now is NSR.  Not anticoagulated due to GIB
   last month.
   8.       Type 2 DM.  Continue RISS and glargine qhs.
   9.       Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No
   evidence bleeding or hemolysis.  Slightly down from 24 to 22 today.
   Was iron deficient in 7/[**2103**].
   -          continue ferrous gluconate
   -          monitor hct
   10.    Agitation/AMS/?Pain:  Mental status is improved.
                  -  continue fentanyl boluses prn pain/agitation
                  -  olanzapine
                  - celexa

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (PAF) not on anticoagulation, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Vent-Associated Pneumonia: The patient completed 14 days of Zosyn for VAP but still has rising temperatures, white blood cell count, and thick secretions, which are concerning for ongoing VAP. Previous sputum samples have shown pseudomonas and gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient will be empirically treated for VAP while awaiting sputum culture results with Colistin.

2. Respiratory Failure: The respiratory failure is multifactorial due to recurrent VAP, tracheobroncheomalacia after Y-stent placement, and COPD. The patient has completed 14 days of Zosyn but will initiate Colistin today given the concern of ongoing pneumonia. The chest X-ray does not show evidence of CHF, so the lasix drip will be discontinued.

   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP yesterday, but now has rising temperatures, WBC and thick
   secretions, concerning for ongoing vent-associated pneumonia.  Previous
   sputum sample Multifactorial including tracheobroncheomalacia,
   multifocal PNA, as well as pulm edema and COPD. S/p treatment for
   acinetobacter and stenotrophamonas with Bactrim and Unasyn this
   admission. Completed 14 day course of zosyn for pseudomonas PNA on
   [**10-2**].   Continues to make purulent secretions. Unclear what bugs in
   sputum are pathogens vs colonization in this chronically vented
   patient.
   -Continue to monitor clinically and radiographically, if decompensates,
   re-start abx for VAP, tailoring to sputum speciation/senses.
   -Nebs
   -Diurese as able.
   -Continue to wean vent as tolerated
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -will check CXR daily
   ## CHF/Total body overload: Recent TTE showed moderate systolic pulm
   artery hypertension. Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities,
   nl to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
   - Goal remains 1L negative daily, was ~1.8L negative yesterday after
   increasing lasix gtt, however now patient c/o hearing loss that is
   concerning for loop diuretic induced ototoxicity.
   - Hold diuresis today, monitor I/Os and auditory acuity.  If further
   diuresis needed, consider diuril.
   ## ARF: Considered to be post-contrast ATN, no resolved.
   ## Agitation/AMS/?Pain: Much improved as sedation weaned down. Will be
   minimizing benzos.
   -continue fentanyl boluses prn pain/agitation
   -olanzapine
   -celexa
   ## HTN: relatively hypotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives to
   allow for more diuresis.
   ## COPD: Continue Combivent MDIs
   ## AF: Off anticoagulation since GIB last month, currently in sinus
   rhythm
   ## DM2: Con
t RISS/Lantus
   ## Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No evidence
   bleeding or hemolysis.  Slightly down from 24 to 22 today.  Was iron
   deficient in 7/[**2103**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and atrial fibrillation. She has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has completed a 14-day course of Zosyn for Pseudomonas pneumonia but continues to produce purulent secretions, indicating ongoing infection. She also has anasarca, which is causing fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of VAP, despite completing a course of antibiotics. The presence of rising temperatures, white blood cell count, and thick secretions suggests ongoing infection. The patient's chronic ventilation status makes it difficult to differentiate between pathogens and colonization.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been treated for multiple VAP episodes, including stenotrophomonas and acinetobacter infections. Despite treatment, she continues to produce purulent secretions, indicating a high risk for recurrent or persistent VAP.

3. Fluid Overload (Anasarca): The patient's fluid overload is indicated by her obesity, elevated body weight, and positive fluid balance. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF not on
   anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia, DM, who has
   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.       Vent-Associated Pneumonia.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP on [**10-2**], but had rising temperatures, WBC and thick secretions
   yesterday ([**10-3**]), so was started on Colistin for concern for ongoing
   vent-associated pneumonia.  Fever curve is stable and WBC trending down
   slightly.  However, patient is having respiratory distress and
   bronchospasm secondary to colistin in spite of nebs pre- and post-
   treatment.
   -            d/c colistin due to respiratory distress and hypoxia
   following use of colistin
   -            f/u sputum culture (GNRs)
   -            consider zosyn if patient is febrile or has worsening
   respiratory secretions
   -            follow fever curve and WBC
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Respiratory failure is multifactorial
   due to recurrent vent-associated pneumonia, tracheobroncheomalacia s/p
   Y-stent placement, and COPD.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn on
   [**10-2**].  Patient did not tolerate [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will stop antibiotics and
   consider zosyn if febrile.   No evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x
   ray.
   -            daily CXR
   -            f/u sputum cultures
   -            continue standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -            titrate FiO2 if possible
   3.       Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis until
   [**10-2**].  Lasix drip was held on [**10-3**] due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given
   the lack of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, lasix drip was
   discontinued.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg since
   admission and is negative 9L for LOS.   Patient appears to no longer
   require diuretics since there has been improvement of her renal
   function.
   -            goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   -            follow daily weights and Is/Os
   4.        ARF.  Patient had baseline Cr of 0.9.  Cr rose to 2.5 in
   setting of contrast nephropathy, but renal function continues to
   improve.  She has good urine output and Cr fell from 1.5 to 1.2 today.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          follow Cr
   -          follow urine output
   5.        HTN.  Patient
s bloopd pressure has ranged from 140s to 170s
   systolic over the past 24 hours.  Antihypertensives were previously
   being held to give room for lasix diuresis, but have been slowly
   resumed after discontinuation of lasix diuresis.  Now on amlodipine and
   metoprolol.  At home, patient takes hydralazine 10 mg q8hr, Nitropaste
   q6hours, lopressor 37.5 q8hrs, HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Norvasc 10 mg
   daily.
   -          Continue amlodipine and metoprolol; increase metoprolol if
   needed for BP or HR control and then consider resuming hydralazine if
   still hypertensive
   -          follow BP
   6.       Tachycardia.  HR in the 100s overnight but has improved with
   initiation of home metoprolol.  Tachycardia may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress or agitation.  EKG was NSR, thought patient has a
   history of PAF.
   -          follow HR
   -          uptitrate BB to home dose of 37.5 TID if HR remains elevated
   7.        COPD. Continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   8.       Paroxysmal A. fib.  Now is NSR.  Not anticoagulated due to GIB
   last month.
   9.       Type 2 DM.  Continue RISS and glargine qhs.  FS 80s to 190s.
   10.    Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No
   evidence bleeding or hemolysis, though patient has history of GIB due
   to diverticulosis and hemorrhoids during last admission.
   -          continue ferrous gluconate
   -          monitor hct
   11.    Agitation.  Patient was previously agitated earlier in MICU
   stay, but now appropriate and answering questions.  Mental status is
   improved.  Will minimize mind altering meds.
                  -  d/c fentanyl IV boluses and transition to oxycodone
   for pain
                  -  olanzapine
                  -  celexa

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation due to recent gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Vent-Associated Pneumonia: The patient completed 14 days of Zosyn for VAP on [**10-2**], but showed signs of ongoing infection such as rising temperatures, white blood cell count, and thick respiratory secretions. Colistin was started but caused respiratory distress and bronchospasm. Therefore, colistin has been discontinued, and the patient's sputum culture will be followed. Zosyn may be considered if the patient becomes febrile or has worsening respiratory secretions.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes recurrent VAP, tracheobroncheomalacia after Y-stent placement, and COPD. Daily chest x-rays, sputum cultures, and continued nebulizer treatments with albuterol/atrovent will be continued. FiO2 will be titrated as possible.

3. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of"

   3.       Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis until
   [**10-2**].  Lasix drip was held on [**10-3**] due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given
   the lack of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, lasix drip was
   discontinued.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg since
   admission and is negative 9L for LOS.   Patient appears to no longer
   require diuretics since there has been improvement of her renal
   function.
   -            goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   -            follow daily weights and Is/Os
   4.        ARF.  Patient had baseline Cr of 0.9.  Cr rose to 2.5 in
   setting of contrast nephropathy, but renal function continues to
   improve.  She has good urine output and Cr fell from 1.5 to 1.2 today.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          follow Cr
   -          follow urine output
   5.        HTN.  Patient
s bloopd pressure has ranged from 140s to 170s
   systolic over the past 24 hours.  Antihypertensives were previously
   being held to give room for lasix diuresis, but have been slowly
   resumed after discontinuation of lasix diuresis.  Now on amlodipine and
   metoprolol.  At home, patient takes hydralazine 10 mg q8hr, Nitropaste
   q6hours, lopressor 37.5 q8hrs, HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Norvasc 10 mg
   daily.
   -          Continue amlodipine and metoprolol; increase metoprolol if
   needed for BP or HR control
   -          follow BP
   6.        COPD. Continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   7.       Paroxysmal A. fib.  Now is NSR.  Not anticoagulated due to GIB
   last month.
   8.       Type 2 DM.  Continue RISS and glargine qhs.  FS 80s to 190s.
   9.       Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No
   evidence bleeding or hemolysis, though patient has history of GIB due
   to diverticulosis and hemorrhoids during last admission.
   -          continue ferrous gluconate
   -          monitor hct

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF not on
   anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia, DM, who has
   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.       Vent-Associated Pneumonia.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP yesterday, but now has rising temperatures, WBC and thick
   secretions, concerning for ongoing vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR
   appears unchanged.  Previous sputum sample on [**9-30**] showed pseudomonas
   and GNRs.  On [**9-30**], sputum grew pseudomonas sensitive only to amikacin
   and Zosyn.  Will empirically treat for VAP while awaiting sputum
   culture results with Colistin.
   -            initiate colisitin (Day 1 = [**2103-10-2**])
   -            f/u sputum culture
   -            follow fever curve and WBC
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Respiratory failure is multifactorial
   due to recurrent vent-associated pneumonia, tracheobroncheomalacia s/p
   Y-stent placement, and COPD.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn on
   [**10-2**], but will initiate colistin today given concern of ongoing
   pneumonia.  CXR does not show evidence of CHF so will discontinue lasix
   drip.
   -            daily CXR
   -            f/u sputum cultures
   -            continue standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -            stop aggressive diuresis given lack of evidence of
   pulmonary edema
   -            titrate FiO2 if possible
   3.       Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis.  Lasix
   drip was held yesterday due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given the lack
   of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, will discontinue to
   lasix drip.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg since
   admission and is negative 8.5L for LOS.   Patient may no longer require
   diuretics since there has been improvement of her renal function.
   -            goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   -            follow daily weights and Is/Os
   4.        ARF.  Patient had baseline Cr of 0.9.  Cr rose to 2.5 in
   setting of contrast nephropathy, but renal function has improved and Cr
   now stable for several days at 1.5.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          follow Cr
   5.        HTN.  Patient
s bloopd pressure has ranged from 110s to 170s
   systolic over the past 24 hours.  Antihypertensives were being held to
   give room for lasix diuresis.  Now that patient is off lasix drip, will
   slowly add back antihypertensives.  At home, patient takes hydralazine
   10 mg q8hr, Nitropaste q6hours, lopressor 37.5 q8hrs, HCTZ 12.5 mg
   daily, and Norvasc 10 mg daily.
   -          start amlodipine
   -          follow BP
   6.        COPD. Continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   7.       Paroxysmal A. fib.  Now is NSR.  Not anticoagulated due to GIB
   last month.
   8.       Type 2 DM.  Continue RISS and glargine qhs.
   9.       Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No
   evidence bleeding or hemolysis, though patient has history of GIB due
   to diverticulosis and hemorrhoids during last admission.
   -          continue ferrous gluconate
   -          monitor hct
   10.    Agitation.  Patient was previously agitated earlier in MICU
   stay, but now appropriate and answering questions.  Mental status is
   improved.  Will minimize mind altering meds.

The patient has completed 14 days of piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for VAP but now presents with rising temperatures, white blood cell count, and thick secretions, suggesting ongoing VAP. A sputum culture on 9/30 showed pseudomonas and gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient will be empirically treated for VAP while awaiting sputum culture results with colistin.

The patient also has respiratory failure due to recurrent VAP, tracheobroncheomalacia after Y-stent placement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's chest X-ray does not show evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF), so diuretic therapy with lasix will be discontinued.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF not on
   anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia, DM, who has
   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.       Vent-Associated Pneumonia.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP on [**10-2**], but had rising temperatures, WBC and thick secretions
   yesterday ([**10-3**]), so was started on Colistin for concern for ongoing
   vent-associated pneumonia.  Fever curve and WBC improving on Colistin.
   -            continue colisitin (Day 1 = [**2103-10-2**])
   -            f/u sputum culture
   -            follow fever curve and WBC
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Respiratory failure is multifactorial
   due to recurrent vent-associated pneumonia, tracheobroncheomalacia s/p
   Y-stent placement, and COPD.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn on
   [**10-2**], and is now on day 2 of colistin for ongoing pneumonia.  No
   evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x ray.
   -            daily CXR
   -            f/u sputum cultures
   -            continue standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -            titrate FiO2 if possible
   3.       Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis until
   [**10-2**].  Lasix drip was held on [**10-3**] due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given
   the lack of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, lasix drip was
   discontinued.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg since
   admission and is negative 9L for LOS.   Patient appears to no longer
   require diuretics since there has been improvement of her renal
   function.
   -            goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   -            follow daily weights and Is/Os
   4.        ARF.  Patient had baseline Cr of 0.9.  Cr rose to 2.5 in
   setting of contrast nephropathy, but renal function continues to
   improve.  She has good urine output and Cr fell from 1.5 to 1.2 today.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          follow Cr
   -          follow urine output
   5.        HTN.  Patient
s bloopd pressure has ranged from 140s to 170s
   systolic over the past 24 hours.  Antihypertensives were previously
   being held to give room for lasix diuresis, but have been slowly
   resumed after discontinuation of lasix diuresis.  Now on amlodipine and
   metoprolol.  At home, patient takes hydralazine 10 mg q8hr, Nitropaste
   q6hours, lopressor 37.5 q8hrs, HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Norvasc 10 mg
   daily.
   -          Continue amlodipine and metoprolol; increase metoprolol if
   needed for BP or HR control
   -          follow BP
   6.        COPD. Continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   7.       Paroxysmal A. fib.  Now is NSR.  Not anticoagulated due to GIB
   last month.
   8.       Type 2 DM.  Continue RISS and glargine qhs.  FS 80s to 190s.
   9.       Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No
   evidence bleeding or hemolysis, though patient has history of GIB due
   to diverticulosis and hemorrhoids during last admission.
   -          continue ferrous gluconate
   -          monitor hct
   10.    Agitation.  Patient was previously agitated earlier in MICU
   stay, but now appropriate and answering questions.  Mental status is
   improved.  Will minimize mind altering meds.
                  -  continue fentanyl boluses prn pain/agitation
                  -  olanzapine
                  -  celexa

   ATN.
   1)      Acute on chronic respiratory failure
 Multiple organisms on
   sputum cultures but elected to treat only the Pseudomonas. Completed
   Zosyn 14 days [**2103-10-2**]. Continue combivent Q4H. Continue to wean vent as
   tolerated. Wean FiO2 as tolerated. She is chronically colonized with
   multiple gram-negative pathogens.
   - fever curve unchanged, WBC improved.  Did not tolerate colistin.
   Will d/c it and follow fever curve.
   2)      Agitation
 Answering questions appropriately over the past
   several days; continue to minimize sedation / analgesia and avoid
   drips. Would prefer to avoid benzos and use anti-psychotics for anxiety
   / agitation.
   - somewhat somnolent this AM, just received fentanyl for generalized
   pain.  Will switch to oxycodone elixir.
   3)      Anasarca
 Will hold lasix for now as CXR does not demonstrate
   pulmonary edema.  Autodiuresed yesterday without lasix.
   4)      HTN:  Restart home antihypertensives slowly.  Tolerated restart
   of amlodipine & lopressor.
   5)     ARF / CRI
 Creatinine improving, almost back to baseline.
   6)     Partial SBO
 Resolved; continues to tolerate TF.  Bowel
   regimen.
   7)     COPD
 Continue nebs.
   8)     F/E/N: TFs at goal. Follow/replete lytes as needed.
   9)      Heme: Hct stable at 25.  On iron. Goal transfusion is >21%. No

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure admitted with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has a history of multiple comorbidities, including COPD, anemia, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and partial small bowel obstruction. The patient's current condition is complicated by acute respiratory distress, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and anasarca.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying chronic respiratory failure, combined with VAP and the need for mechanical ventilation, puts her at risk for further respiratory deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The presence of multiple organisms on sputum cultures indicates a potential ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of renal insufficiency, and her current condition may worsen due to sepsis, medication toxicity, or inadequate renal perfusion.
4. Anasarca: The patient's fluid overload, as evidenced by her weight gain and edema, increases the risk of developing anasarca, a condition characterized by generalized edema.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been uncontrolled, and restarting home antihypertensive medications needs to be done cautiously to avoid any adverse effects.
6. Partial small bowel obstruction: Although the obstruction has resolved, the patient's ongoing gastrointestinal issues need to be monitored closely to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF not on
   anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia, DM, who has
   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.       Vent-Associated Pneumonia.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP on [**10-2**], but had rising temperatures, WBC and thick secretions
   yesterday ([**10-3**]), so was started on Colistin for concern for ongoing
   vent-associated pneumonia.  Fever curve is stable and WBC trending down
   slightly.  However, patient is having respiratory distress and
   bronchospasm secondary to colistin in spite of nebs pre- and post-
   treatment.   Now afebrile off antibiotics.  WBC stably elevated.
   -            f/u sputum culture (GNRs)
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Respiratory failure is multifactorial
   due to recurrent vent-associated pneumonia, tracheobroncheomalacia s/p
   Y-stent placement, and COPD.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn on
   [**10-2**].  Patient did not tolerate [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will stop antibiotics and
   consider zosyn if febrile.   No evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x
   ray.
   -            daily CXR
   -            f/u sputum cultures
   -            continue standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -            titrate FiO2 if possible
   3.       Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis until
   [**10-2**].  Lasix drip was held on [**10-3**] due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given
   the lack of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, lasix drip was
   discontinued but now patient has increasing interstitial edema so will
   give lasix today.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg
   since admission and is negative 8.5L for LOS.
   -            goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   -            follow daily weights and Is/Os
   -            resume outpatient HCTZ
   4.        ARF.  Patient had baseline Cr of 0.9.  Cr rose to 2.5 in
   setting of contrast nephropathy, but renal function continues to
   improve.  She has good urine output and Cr is stable.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          follow Cr
   -          follow urine output
   5.        HTN.  Patient

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and atrial fibrillation. She has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She completed 14 days of Zosyn therapy for VAP but developed respiratory distress and bronchospasm due to colistin, leading to discontinuation of antibiotics. 

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes recurrent VAP, tracheobroncheomalacia after Y-stent placement, and COPD. Her congestive heart failure (CHF) was managed with diuretics, but lasix was held due to concerns of ototoxicity. However, the patient developed increasing interstitial edema, so lasix was resumed. 

The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to contrast nephropathy, but her renal function is improving with good urine output. Her hypertension is being managed with amlodipine and metoprolol. 

Other conditions include COPD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (now in normal sinus rhythm), type 2 diabetes mellitus, anemia, and agitation. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is now appropriate and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF not on
   anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia, DM, who has
   trach and PEG here with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   vent-associated pneumonia.
   1.       Vent-Associated Pneumonia.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn
   for VAP on [**10-2**], but had rising temperatures, WBC and thick secretions
   yesterday ([**10-3**]), so was started on Colistin for concern for ongoing
   vent-associated pneumonia.  Fever curve is stable and WBC trending down
   slightly.  However, patient is having respiratory distress and
   bronchospasm secondary to colistin in spite of nebs pre- and post-
   treatment.
   -            d/c colistin due to respiratory distress and hypoxia
   following use of colistin
   -            f/u sputum culture (GNRs)
   -            consider zosyn if patient is febrile or has worsening
   respiratory secretions
   -            follow fever curve and WBC
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Respiratory failure is multifactorial
   due to recurrent vent-associated pneumonia, tracheobroncheomalacia s/p
   Y-stent placement, and COPD.  Patient completed 14 days of Zosyn on
   [**10-2**].  Patient did not tolerate [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will stop antibiotics and
   consider zosyn if febrile.   No evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x
   ray.
   -            daily CXR
   -            f/u sputum cultures
   -            continue standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -            titrate FiO2 if possible
   3.       Congestive heart failure.  Patient had a recent TTE on [**2103-9-12**]
   which showed EF at 45%.   Patient is recovering for
   contrast-nephropathy and was requiring lasix drip for diuresis until
   [**10-2**].  Lasix drip was held on [**10-3**] due to concern of ototoxicity.  Given
   the lack of evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, lasix drip was
   discontinued.   Patient is currently negative approximately 10 kg since
   admission and is negative 8.5L for LOS.   Patient appears to no longer
   require diuretics since there has been improvement of her renal
   function.
   -            goals diuresis of 0.5 L daily, lasix PRN
   -            follow daily weights and Is/Os
   4.        ARF.  Patient had baseline Cr of 0.9.  Cr rose to 2.5 in
   setting of contrast nephropathy, but renal function continues to
   improve.  She has good urine output and Cr fell from 1.5 to 1.2 today.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          follow Cr
   -          follow urine output
   5.        HTN.  Patient
s bloopd pressure has ranged from 140s to 170s
   systolic over the past 24 hours.  Antihypertensives were previously
   being held to give room for lasix diuresis, but have been slowly
   resumed after discontinuation of lasix diuresis.  Now on amlodipine and
   metoprolol.  At home, patient takes hydralazine 10 mg q8hr, Nitropaste
   q6hours, lopressor 37.5 q8hrs, HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Norvasc 10 mg
   daily.
   -          Continue amlodipine and metoprolol; increase metoprolol if
   needed for BP or HR control and then consider resuming hydralazine if
   still hypertensive
   -          follow BP
   6.       Tachycardia.  HR in the 100s overnight but has improved with
   initiation of home metoprolol.  Tachycardia may have been secondary to
   respiratory distress or agitation.  EKG was NSR, thought patient has a
   history of PAF.
   -          follow HR
   -          uptitrate BB to home dose of 37.5 TID if HR remains elevated
   7.        COPD. Continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   8.       Paroxysmal A. fib.  Now is NSR.  Not anticoagulated due to GIB
   last month.
   9.       Type 2 DM.  Continue RISS and glargine qhs.  FS 80s to 190s.
   10.    Anemia. Hct has been in mid 20s throughout admission. No
   evidence bleeding or hemolysis, though patient has history of GIB due
   to diverticulosis and hemorrhoids during last admission.
   -          continue ferrous gluconate
   -          monitor hct
   11.    Agitation.  Patient was previously agitated earlier in MICU
   stay, but now appropriate and answering questions.  Mental status is
   improved.  Will minimize mind altering meds.
                  -  d/c fentanyl IV boluses and transition to oxycodone
   for pain
                  -  olanzapine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with respiratory failure, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and has been treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia. There is a possibility of further deterioration in respiratory status.

2. Infection: The sputum cultures show growth of gram-negative rods, suggesting a potential ongoing infection. This may require adjustment of antibiotic therapy or consideration of additional interventions to control the infection.

3. Agitation: The patient has been agitated in the past but is currently answering questions appropriately. It is important to continue minimizing sedation and analgesia while avoiding the use of benzodiazepines and considering the use of anti-psychotics for anxiety or agitation.

4. Anasarca: The patient appears somewhat volume overloaded on CXR, indicating a possible fluid retention issue. This could lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.

5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and will restart home antihypertensives slowly. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to complications such as cardiac events or end-organ damage.

6. Acute renal failure (ARF)/chronic renal insufficiency (CRI): The patient's creatinine levels are improving, indicating some improvement in renal function. However, ongoing monitoring and management of renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, pseudomonas pneumonia, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with Zosyn for the pseudomonas infection and is currently on combivent every 4 hours. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator as tolerated and reduce FiO2 as well. She is chronically colonized with multiple gram-negative pathogens and did not tolerate colistin. The patient's agitation has improved, and sedation/analgesia will be minimized to avoid the use of benzodiazepines and instead use anti-psychotics for anxiety/agitation. Anasarca is noted, and lasix will be restarted to address volume overload. The patient's hypertension is being restarted with home antihypertensives. Her ARF/CRI is improving, and her partial small bowel obstruction has resolved. She continues to tolerate tube feeding and bowel regimen. The patient has COPD and will continue nebulizer treatments. Her hemoglobin is stable, and she is on iron supplementation. The ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being considered for transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility."
