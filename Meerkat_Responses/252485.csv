   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder on lithium, hypothyroidism, and presents with symptomatic bradycardia with hypotension after temporary pacing wire placement. 

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her current condition. Some potential medical complications include:

1. Lithium toxicity: The patient is on lithium for bipolar disorder, and lithium toxicity can cause medication-induced SA or AV dysfunction, leading to bradycardia and hypotension.

2. Myxedema coma: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and myxedema coma is a severe form of hypothyroidism that can cause altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension.

3. Sick sinus syndrome: This refers to dysfunction of the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is the natural pacemaker of the heart. Sick sinus syndrome can cause bradycardia and other rhythm abnormalities.

4. Medication-induced side effects: The patient is on several medications, including metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker that can cause bradycardia and hypotension.

5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. Chronic renal insufficiency can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder on lithium, hypothyroidism, who presents with symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension after temporary pacing wire placement. The etiology of the bradycardia is still unknown but could be due to medication-induced SA or AV dysfunction, lithium toxicity, or extra beta blocker effect. The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with elevated creatinine levels and hyperkalemia. She also has altered mental status, delirium on top of baseline dementia, and agitation. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's symptoms of bradycardia may lead to inadequate cardiac output and reduced tissue perfusion, resulting in hypotension and organ dysfunction.
2. Medication-induced SA or AV dysfunction: The use of certain medications, such as lithium and beta blockers, can impair the function of the sinoatrial (SA) or atrioventricular (AV) node, leading to bradycardia.
3. Lithium toxicity: Elevated lithium levels can cause various symptoms, including bradycardia, renal insufficiency, and altered mental status.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient"

   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   sinus node dysfunction - likely due to long standing lithium, beta
   blocker and aging
   temporary wire placed
   mild renal insufficiency
   Temporary pacemaker is capturing with good threshold
   plan for permanent pacemaker on [**2152-7-3**]

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder on lithium, hypothyroidism, and presents with symptomatic bradycardia with hypotension post temperature pacemaker wire placement. The patient's etiology of symptomatic bradycardia is still unknown, but it could include medication-induced SA or AV dysfunction with lithium toxicity or extra beta blocker (unclear if in setting of decreased drug clearance if patient's creatinine is up from baseline), myxedema coma with history of hypothyroidism, sick sinus syndrome, etc.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/50 to 196/121 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable except for jugular venous distention (JVD) and the presence of a temporary pacing wire.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 212 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.4 g/dL, elevated potassium (K+) level of 5.3 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 49 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an elderly female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder on lithium, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation.
- The patient presented with symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension, for which a temporary pacing wire was placed. The cause of the bradycardia is still unknown but could be due to medication-induced SA or AV dysfunction with lithium toxicity, extra beta-blocker effect, myxedema coma, or sick sinus syndrome.
- The patient temporarily achieved normal sinus rhythm but required a permanent pacemaker placement.
- The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine level of 1.9, currently at 2.0.
- The patient has altered mental status, which includes delirium on top of baseline dementia. She has been agitated at times, especially after 5 pm.
- The patient has a slightly positive urinalysis over the weekend, and a urine culture will be followed to determine the need for continued intravenous antibiotics.
- The patient has extrapyramidal syndrome and is being treated with carbidopa/levodopa.
- The patient has hypothyroidism and is being treated with levothyroxine.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening bradycardia or development of heart block due to the patient's underlying conditions or medication effects.
2. Progression of renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury.
3. worsening of mental status or development of further complications related to delirium and dementia.
4. Development of a urinary tract infection (UTI) requiring further management.
5. Complications related to the permanent pacemaker placement, such as infection or lead dislodgment.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, renal function, mental status, and any changes in the aforementioned potential complications."
