","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes. He presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, and elevated lithium levels. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lithium toxicity: The patient has symptoms consistent with lithium toxicity (nausea, hypotension, tremors) and confirmed by lab values. CVVH has been initiated to remove lithium from the body, but additional sessions may be required.
2. Acute renal failure: The cause of the patient's renal failure is uncertain, whether it is due to a toxic dose of lithium or another etiology. Close monitoring of renal function and further evaluation are necessary.
3. Schizophrenia: The patient requires ongoing psychiatric care, including the need for a Section 12 designation from OSH and a 1:1 sitter when well. It is important to evaluate whether this was an intentional overdose or unintentional ingestion.
4. Diabetes mellitus: Metformin should be held, and the patient's glycemic control should be closely monitored.
5. Potential complications related to ICU care, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers, need to be prevented and monitored.

Assessment and Plan:
- Initiate hemodialysis (HD) to treat lithium toxicity.
- Monitor lithium levels immediately after HD and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 98/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of prolonged hospitalization and holds psych medications with cardiac side effects due to the risk of lithium-induced cardiotoxicity. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and blood glucose levels. Imaging reveals a retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms, which is grossly stable and may be pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis. Microbiology cultures are pending. The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, poisoning/overdose, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining good airway hygiene, proper hand hygiene, and regular assessment of respiratory status.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings, early ambulation, and possibly antico"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate
   - further HD per serial lithium levels
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin this morning for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If
   cultures negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine yesterday during HD, but off
   since yesterday evening.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Discuss with outpatient pysch if overdose could have been purposeful
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol until discuss with pharm and pysch
   whether can re-start
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: IJ, HD line, radial a-line, PIV x2
   # Communication: Family (contact information on white board in room)
   # Code:  Full - presumed.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who presents with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and lithium toxicity. The patient has undergone several interventions including hemodialysis (HD) for lithium clearance and fluid repletion. The patient's lithium levels are trending down, but close monitoring is required due to the risk of rebound toxicity. The patient also has a fever, nausea, vomiting, and an abnormal chest X-ray suggesting possible pneumonia or aspiration. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered, and the patient has been started on empiric antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further HD sessions may be needed based on lithium levels. The patient's other medical conditions, including diabetes and schizophrenia, are being managed accordingly. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebound lithium toxicity: Since the patient's lithium levels are decreasing, there is a possibility of rebound toxicity once intra/extracellular levels equilibrate. Close monitoring of lithium levels is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, abnormal chest X-ray, and leukocytosis raise concern for pneumonia. Cultures have been ordered, and the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has experienced acute renal failure, which could lead to further deterioration of renal function. Monitoring of renal parameters and ongoing management of fluid and electrolyte balance is"

   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions pending trend of lithium levels
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE
   - Send urine lytes, urine eosinophils
   - Renal U/S in am to r/o obstruction
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate
   - further HD per serial lithium levels
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms once lithium dialysised
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine yesterday, but off since
   yesterday evening.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Discuss with outpatient pysch with could have been purposeful
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol until discuss with pharm and pysch
   whether can re-start
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has presented with hypotension, ARF, and lithium toxicity. ARF can be caused by prerenal volume depletion, which may have resulted in acute renal failure and predisposed the patient to lithium nephritis. The patient's renal function has significantly improved after hemodialysis (HD) yesterday.

2. Lithium Toxicity: The patient's lithium levels are within normal limits, but close monitoring is necessary due to the risk of rebound toxicity as intra/extracellular levels equilibrate. The patient requires further HD sessions based on the trend of lithium levels.

3. Fever: The patient's temperature increased to 100.6 overnight, indicating a possible infection. The chest X-ray shows a retrocardiac opacity, which may be pneumonia (PNA) or aspiration. Daily chest X-rays and cultures should be done to identify the cause of fever and initiate appropriate treatment.

4. Nausea and Vomiting: These symptoms could be due to gastroenteritis or lithium toxicity. Monitoring the patient's symptoms once lithium is dialyzed is important. Repleting volume as needed is essential.

5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium toxicity. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.

6. Schizophrenia: The patient's psychiatric condition may be exacerbated by"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate
   - further HD per serial lithium levels
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin this morning for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If
   cultures negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine yesterday during HD, but off
   since yesterday evening.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Discuss with outpatient pysch if overdose could have been purposeful
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol until discuss with pharm and pysch
   whether can re-start
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Left IJ, R IJ HD line, radial a-line, PIV x2
   # Communication: Family (contact information on white board in room)
   # Code:  Full - presumed.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 possible extubation

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure, and lithium toxicity. 

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 119/70 mmHg (88/56-139/91 mmHg), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm was sinus tachycardia, and he had right lower extremity edema.

The patient underwent extubation today and started nebulizers for wheeziness. He requested to defer signing the ICU consent until tomorrow. The Mini-BAL showed no microorganisms, while the endotracheal sputum revealed 2+ GPC in pairs, chains, and clusters. The renal recommendations were to hold all diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and to continue intravenous fluids. The lithium levels trended down to within normal limits after hemodialysis yesterday.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine level improved significantly, indicating improvement in renal function. The imaging showed a slightly impinging left tracheal wall with no appreciable ple"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate but will decrease frequency to
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   - Continue IVF per Toxicology recommendations (consider decreasing rate
   to 150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
 will ask Tox re:
   duration of IVF fluids
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels (checking [**Hospital1 **],
   have been stable 0.8-0.9)
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin ysterday for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If cultures
   negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   -
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine two days ago during HD, but off
   over 24 hours. Blood pressures have been stable.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
 may consider restarting later today in
   setting of stable renal function
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol per Psych recs
 but will touch
   base with them early this morning as paable renal functionte to
   150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Left IJ, R IJ HD line, radial a-line, PIV x2

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with schizophrenia, hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presents with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and lithium toxicity. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F (38.0°C), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/70 mmHg to 139/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is extubated today and started nebulizers for wheeziness. 

The patient's recent medical history includes prolonged hemodialysis (HD) for lithium clearance, during which lithium levels trended down to within normal limits twice. The patient also had an endotracheal sputum culture showing 2+ Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs, chains, and clusters. Mini-BAL was negative for microorganisms, and the endotracheal sputum had >25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) per high-power field. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.5 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 28.1%, platelet (Plt) count of 300 thousand/mm³, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 91 mg/dL, and sodium (Na+) level of 140 mEq/L. Imaging shows a slight improvement in the basal aeration and partial atelectasis of the right middle lobe. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention, including lithium toxicity, acute renal failure, fever, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, and possible pneumonia. The plan includes monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity, continuing IV fluids as recommended by toxicology, further hemodialysis sessions as needed, holding all diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and closely trending lithium levels, creatinine, and electrolytes. Cultures have been obtained, and empiric antibiotic therapy has been started for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, insulin sliding scale, and holding all other medications until further evaluation. The patient's code status is presumed full, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement with a possible extubation today."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who presents with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and lithium toxicity. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition includes nausea, vomiting, fever, and hypotension. His vital signs are stable, but he has low urine output. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels indicating impaired renal function. Imaging studies reveal a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, which is concerning for pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infectious process, and the chest X-ray findings are concerning for pneumonia. It is important to monitor his respiratory status and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary. Continued dialysis may be required if renal function does not improve.
3. Lithium Toxicity: The patient's lithium levels persistently remain within normal limits, but there are signs of lithium toxicity such as nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. Monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity and close follow-up of lithium levels are essential.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate but will decrease frequency to
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   - Continue IVF per Toxicology recommendations (consider decreasing rate
   to 150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
 will ask Tox re:
   duration of IVF fluids
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels (checking [**Hospital1 **],
   have been stable 0.8-0.9)
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin ysterday for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If cultures
   negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine two days ago during HD, but off
   over 24 hours. Blood pressures have been stable.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
 may consider restarting later today in
   setting of stable renal function
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol per Psych recs
 but will touch
   base with them early this morning as paable renal functionte to
   150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Left IJ, R IJ HD line, radial a-line, PIV x2
   # Communication: Family (contact information on white board in room)
   # Code:  Full - presumed.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 possible extubation

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who is currently in the ICU. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and lithium toxicity. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) yesterday for lithium clearance, and his levels trended down to within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Lithium toxicity: Monitor for signs including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity.
2. Acute renal failure: Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted in acute renal failure. Further HD sessions may be needed depending on lithium levels. Trend lytes, lithium level, and creatinine closely.
3. Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity, potentially pneumonia. Also concern for ongoing viral process given GI symptoms. Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures. Empiric vanco & cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). If cultures negative by 1-27, will narrow coverage.
4. Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity. Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed. Replete volume as needed.
5. Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine during HD, but off over 24 hours. Blood"
