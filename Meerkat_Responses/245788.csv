   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and various other chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF), severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, gout, and a history of cancer treatments. 

The patient presented to the emergency department with left hip pain and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypotension. She was admitted to the ICU for urosepsis, hip pain, acute on chronic renal failure, CHF/severe AS, and other chronic conditions. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including levofloxacin, heparin, insulin, famotidine, dilaudid, bisacodyl, allopurinol, and tamoxifen. She is also receiving infusions of norepinephrine and other ICU medications.

Her vital signs indicate a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/34 mmHg to 127/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine (Cr), and lactic acid levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present with low potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and calcium (Ca++). 

Imaging studies reveal a low-lying central venous catheter, no evidence of acute fracture in the left hip, and bilateral pleural effusions consistent with CHF. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, sepsis secondary to UTI, exacerbation of CHF, and further deterioration of cardiovascular status. 

The patient's hip pain and elevated WBC count suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to complications such as sepsis. The presence of bilateral pleural effusions indicates CHF, which may worsen if not appropriately managed. 

Given the patient's history of renal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer, there is a risk of cancer recurrence or metastasis, which should be considered in the overall assessment and management plan.

Overall, the patient's condition appears critical, and close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to address the various medical complications and stabilize her condition."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the emergency department with hip pain. She was found to be in shock and had positive urine analysis. The patient has an indwelling port (Portacath) and a presep catheter. She is currently being treated with Zosyn, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Her vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. She is oliguric, meaning she is producing less urine than expected. Renal ultrasound did not show any perinephric abscess or pyelonephritis. The patient has a history of allergies to iodine, anaphylaxis from ciprofloxacin, rash from sulfonamides, morphine, codeine, levofloxacin, and nausea/vomiting from both morphine and codeine. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, edema, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's medical history, social history, and family history are unchanged except for the recent events mentioned above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, positive urine analysis, and shock suggests an ongoing urinary tract infection that has progressed to urosepsis.
2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's severe sepsis may involve dysfunction of one or more"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the emergency department with hip pain and was found to be in shock. She has a positive urine analysis (UA), indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been diagnosed with urosepsis, a severe infection that has spread throughout her body, leading to organ dysfunction. The likely sources of the infection are her urinary tract, portacath (a device used for medication delivery), and hip. She is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics, norepinephrine (Levophed) for blood pressure support, and other ICU medications. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and has a central line in place. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure, high heart rate, and low oxygen saturation. Her urine output is low, and she has an elevated white blood cell count. She has a history of allergies to iodine, anaphylaxis with ciprofloxacin, rash with sulfonamides, and nausea/vomiting with morphine and codeine. She has been experiencing chills and nausea. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her sepsis, including broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid resuscitation. Additional imaging of her hip may be considered to identify any potential sources of infection."

   Ovarian Ca who presented with L hip pain and presumed urosepsis,
   clinical status deteriorated this afternoon with oliguria & acidosis,
   increased pressor requirement & MS changes.  Pt was intubated and ABG
   improving on vent.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Pt presented with positive
   UA, hypotension and presumed urosepsis, but was covered with Vanc/Zosyn
   for 48hrs unable to wean from pressors.  WBC ct rising, worsening
   acidosis and developped Afib with RVR & hypotension requiring addl
   pressors.  Pt was bolused 2.5L and converted, but MS deteriorated & pt
   was intubated for airway protection and acidosis. Post intubation, pt
   was able to wean from pressors. ABG 7.29/38/252
   - will [**Month (only) 38**] FiO2 and repeat ABG
   - apprec ID consult, will monitor BPs overnight, if clinically
   deteriorates, will broaden coverage to Meropenem/Vanc
   - bolus IVF prn, no pressor requirement currently
   - follow CT chest/abd/pelv read, ruling out abscess, septic joint or
   infected hardware
   - consider d/c portocath in am
   - f/u blood & urine cultures, Urine +pseudomonas
sensitivities pending
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt developped Afib with RVR and became
   hypotensive.  Responded to fluid boluses, then post-intubation, all
   pressors weaned and BP stable.  Pt was loaded with digoxin
   - f/u am digoxin level on [**1-20**]
   - fluid bolus prn A.fib & consider amiodarone vs cardioversion if
   uncontrolled RVR
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Apprec renal consult
   for pt with oliguric renal failure likely due to ATN but urine sediment
   revealed sheets of WBCs,  unable to further assess sediment.
   - currently oliguric and extravascularly volume overloaded
   - resp status stable on vent, no acute indication for dialysis
   - renally dose meds, starting phoslo & monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
 AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area 0.7cm, very preload dependant,
   bolus fluid prn and avoid BB/CCBs.
   - continue digoxin, monitor for worsening CHF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. She presented with left hip pain and presumed urosepsis. Her clinical status deteriorated with oliguria, acidosis, increased pressor requirement, and mental status changes. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She has a Foley catheter in place.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient presented with positive urine analysis, hypotension, and presumed urosepsis. She was covered with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for 48 hours but was unable to wean from pressors. Her white blood cell count is rising, and she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension requiring additional pressors. The patient was bolused with fluids and converted back to sinus rhythm, but her mental status deteriorated, and she was intubated for airway protection and acidosis. Post-intubation, the patient was able to wean from pressors. An arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.29/38/252, indicating worsening acidosis.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and became hypotensive. She responded to fluid boluses and then post-intubation, all pressors were weaned, and"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip
   - Redose vanco according to levels
   - Consult ID re: antibiotic coverage/double coverage of pseudomonas
     Recheck abg for Ph/CO2 and lactate
 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and left hip pain. She has been experiencing persistent vasopressor requirements, leukocytosis, and anuric acute renal failure. The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation, likely septic shock, and acute kidney injury. She also has a urinary tract infection caused by pseudomonas, and her pain is poorly controlled. The patient's delirium may be related to age, ICU stay, and medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by pseudomonas, and there are concerns about inadequate antibiotic coverage.
2. Other sources of infection: There is a possibility of other sources of infection such as infected hip, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), line infection (portacath), acalculous cholecystitis, etc.
3. Septic shock: The patient's persistent vasopressor requirements and low blood pressure suggest ongoing septic shock.
4. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's aortic stenosis complicates the management and assessment of volume and central venous pressure.
5. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by increasing creatinine levels and oliguria.
6. Delirium: The patient is showing signs"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. Urosepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas bacteria. The UTI appears to be a likely source of the patient's sepsis, but other potential sources such as an infected hip, Clostridium difficile infection, line infection, cholecystitis, etc. should also be considered.

2. Septic Shock: The patient continues to require pressors for hemodynamic support, indicating ongoing septic shock. Slow escalation of pressors and adequate preload are being monitored.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient also has signs of cardiogenic shock, which complicates the management. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of fluids and vasopressor support.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, suggesting acute renal failure. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fluid boluses are being given to maintain preload, and electrolyte imbalances are being monitored. Renal consultation is recommended.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is well-controlled.

6. Cancer: The patient has a history of gynecological cancer, specifically ovarian cancer.

7. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing delirium, likely due to multiple allergies to pain medications. Pain management should be carefully"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of pain in the left hip. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to worsening acidosis, mental status changes, and hypotension. The patient has a history of allergies to iodine, ciprofloxacin, sulfonamides, morphine, codeine, and levofloxacin. She has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, hydromorphone, and flowsheet data as of 07:27 AM on 01/19/2163.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis and is experiencing organ dysfunction, as indicated by the presence of pneumonia, oliguric renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is also experiencing cardiogenic shock, which may be secondary to her septic state or underlying aortic stenosis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, resulting in oliguric renal failure. This could be due to the sepsis and inadequate perfusion.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or the stress of the infection.
5. Cancer: There is suspicion of malignancy based on the CT scan findings of a cystic left adnexal mass and numerous calc"

   Pseudomonas.  Pt was covered with Vanc/Zosyn for 48hr but clinically
   deteriorated yesterday possibly due to incomplete volume resuscitation.
   Pt was intubated and weaned for pressors, WBC ct now trending down and
   acidosis resolving on vent.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] ID consult, continue ruling out
   other sources of infection.  Will check C. diff X 3 given new diarrhea.
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas in urine
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] ortho consult for L  hip pain and concern for seeding of

 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed
   Afib with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF
   & pressors.  Pt was then Intubated and pressors weaned. Pt still in/out
   of Afib but HR has been much better controlled on digoxin.
   - check am digoxin level on [**1-20**]
   - avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently given the [**Month (only) 38**] plt
   count, will re-consider in am if plts stable

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with oliguric
   renal failure likely [**12-25**] ATN but urine sediment showed sheets of WBCs.
   Creatinine appears to have plateaued and pt having some UOP overnight.
   [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] Renal recs, there is no acute indication for dialysis.  Uremia
   likely contributing to acidosis, currently compensated with vent
   support
   - avoid continuous IVF given poor UOP
   - f/u urine sediment, renally dose meds, check C3/4 & urine eos per
   Renal
   - continue phoslo TID & check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
 AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload
   dependant.  Gentle bolus IVF prn to maintain MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status to avoid massive
   volume overload.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of infection with UA +
   pseudomonas, pan sensitive

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction due to presumed urosepsis. The source of infection is identified as a urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive urine culture for pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient was initially treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam but clinically deteriorated. Therefore, it is important to continue monitoring and managing the sepsis.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and became hypotensive, indicating cardiogenic shock. The patient responded to intravenous fluids and pressors, and digoxin was loaded to control the heart rate. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is necessary, along with checking digoxin levels.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The creatinine level appears to have plateaued, and there is some urine output overnight. Renal consultation is recommended for further management, including monitoring urine sediment, adjusting medications, and checking complement levels.

4. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm. This condition is preload"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for urosepsis with atrial fibrillation/rhythm control ventricular rate, hypotension, acute renal failure, and delirium. The patient is intubated for worsening acidosis and airway protection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing urosepsis caused by Pseudomonas, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Continuous monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension. This condition requires immediate attention to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic status.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to hemodilution from aggressive fluid resuscitation or other factors. Regular monitoring and evaluation of the platelet count are necessary to identify any potential bleeding risks.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is also decreased, possibly due to hemodilution. Trans"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip

 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, admitted with urosepsis. She experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which responded to intravenous fluids (IVF) bolus. The patient's condition worsened, leading to intubation for respiratory failure and confusion. IVF and pressors were weaned off. The patient has allergies to iodine, ciprofloxacin, sulfonamides, and morphine. She is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and hydromorphone.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/36 to 70/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her blood glucose level is 106 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 28.6 K/uL, hemoglobin is 8.1 g/dL, platelet count is 114 K/uL, and creatinine level is 2.8 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging shows no evidence of loculated effusion or empyema, calcified lesions, or fluid collection. Microbiology results indicate a positive urine culture"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)- psuedomonal urospesis also
   likely with asp pna--improving --off pressors with additional fluid
   resuscitation, wbc trending down
      L hip pain remains problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] though no obvious fluid collection on
   imaging, pain with touch, motion on exam--? septic brusitis, ortho
   following and await additonal recs
     continue zosynm f/u cx's
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of afib with RVR and
   hypotension, now rate controlled
   BP improved, sdtable and off of pressors, cvp difficult to follow given
   severe AS, lactates normalized
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   renal follwoing, atn from sepsis hypotension, cr seems to have peaked,
   phos binder started, all meds renally dosed
   thrombocytopenia--on review of records baseline thromnbocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with intial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration,
   dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely, check smear, component of
   hemoconcetration likely though HIT possibiloty but given that plt is
   now at baseline--follow for further reduction from baseline, continue
   heparin products for now given low suspicion for HIT
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)--now rate controlled, on dig, limited
   given her severe af, respnsive to IVFs but would avoid calcium channel
   blockers,  given new drop in hct and plts
     Leukocytosis--improving toward normal, check dc diff, continue vacno
   X 24 more hrs given catheter, clinically improving and highest
   suspicion is of urosepsis, though with line in plae would check
   ultrasound of porta cath and await new cx gram stain and result to show
   no GPs

 URINE CULTURE - At [**2163-1-18**] 03:39 PM
   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip

 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

   failure, hemodynamic instability [**12-25**] to Afib with RVR and MS changes.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Source of infection presumed
   to be urosepsis with positive UA growing out pan sensitive
   Pseudomonas.  Pt was covered with Vanc/Zosyn for 48hr but clinically
   deteriorated yesterday possibly due to incomplete volume resuscitation.
   Pt was intubated and weaned for pressors, WBC ct now trending down and
   acidosis resolving on vent.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] ID consult, continue ruling out
   other sources of infection.  Will check C. diff X 3 given new diarrhea.

 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed
   Afib with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF
   & pressors.  Pt was then Intubated and pressors weaned. Pt still in/out
   of Afib but HR has been much better controlled on digoxin.
   - check am digoxin level on [**1-20**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with left hip pain. She was admitted for presumed urosepsis and later developed septic shock. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to worsening acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and hemodynamic instability. The source of infection is presumed to be urosepsis with positive urine culture growing out Pseudomonas, which was initially covered with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for 48 hours. However, the patient clinically deteriorated possibly due to incomplete volume resuscitation. The patient's condition improved with continued treatment, but she remains in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has a history of severe AS and CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%. She developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and became hypotensive. The pressure responded to intravenous fluids and pressors. The patient was then intubated and pressors weaned.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Urine sediment showed sheets of white blood cells. Creatinine appears to have plateaued, and the patient is having some urine output overnight.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Source of infection presumed
   to be urosepsis with positive UA growing out pan sensitive
   Pseudomonas.  Pt clinically deteriorated on [**1-18**] with worsening
   acidosis/MS changes and was intubated.  Pressors were weaned
   immediately and pt has been maintaining MAPs with occais 500cc

   - ortho consult for L  hip pain, unconcerned for L hip as source of
   infection
   - continue to f/u blood & urine cultures

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. She presented with left hip pain and was admitted for presumed urosepsis. The patient deteriorated clinically on the 18th with worsening acidosis and MS changes, leading to intubation. She has been maintained on minimal ventilator settings, and her white blood cell count trended down. A left chest ultrasound was negative for abscess, and a CT scan was unremarkable for additional infectious sources.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including renal cell and ovarian cancer, for which she received treatment prior to admission. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and mitral stenosis (MS) changes. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/35-58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 19.4 mmHg, and she has positive fluid balance with an intake of 2,864 mL and output of 309 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%. She also has renal cell and ovarian cancer and was admitted for presumed urosepsis. The patient was intubated on [Month/Day (1)] for worsening acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and hemodynamic instability due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and mitral valve changes. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely secondary to urosepsis with positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive pseudomonas. She was initially covered with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for 48 hours but clinically deteriorated yesterday possibly due to incomplete volume resuscitation.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, aortic stenosis, and left hip pain. The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for coverage of pseudomonas in the urine, consulting orthopedics for left hip pain and concern for hardware seeding, following up with blood and urine cultures, and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 through bolus fluid administration as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, currently in the ICU with urosepsis caused by pseudomonas infection. The patient has been intubated for worsening acidosis and airway protection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with improved urine output and decreasing lactate levels. However, the patient still requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is doing well with improved acidosis. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of the ventilator. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adherence to VAP prevention protocols are essential.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis appears to be improving, there is still a risk of further infection due to the presence of pseudomonas bacteria in the urine. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has developed AKI likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial for managing this condition.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) have led to cardiogenic shock. Ongoing monitoring of hemodynamics and cardiovascular status is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, admitted to the ICU for urosepsis with atrial fibrillation, hypotension, acute renal failure, and delirium.
- The patient is intubated for worsening acidosis and airway protection.
- Current assessment shows improvement, with stable hemodynamics, decreasing lactate levels, and trending down WBC count.
- The most likely source of sepsis is pseudomonas urosepsis, although aspiration pneumonia is also possible.
- There is a concern for seeded portacath but low suspicion.
- The patient's hip pain remains a problem, and there is a lower suspicion of septic bursitis.
- Cardiogenic shock is present due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, but now rate-controlled.
- Acute renal failure is attributed to sepsis and hypotension, and the patient is showing signs of autodiuresis.
- Leukocytosis is normalizing, and thrombocytopenia is likely due to hemodilution.
- Anemia is also suspected to be caused by hemodilution.
- Atrial fibrillation is now rate-controlled with digoxin.
- Severe aortic stenosis is noted, and the patient is preload-dependent.
- Urinary tract infection with pseudomonas is identified"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%. She presented to the hospital for presumed urosepsis and was subsequently intubated due to worsening acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and hemodynamic instability. The source of infection is presumed to be urosepsis with positive urine analysis (UA) growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening acidosis and mitral valve changes. She is currently on norepinephrine for blood pressure support and levophed for hemodynamic instability. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C
- Heart rate: 66 bpm
- Blood pressure: 133/43 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on ventilator

The patient is intubated and sedated, not responding to commands. Her chest X-ray shows bilateral effusions and pulmonary edema, while her CT scan shows possible airspace disease. She is weaned off pressors and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) with occasional 500cc boluses. Her white blood cell count trended down, and acidosis resolved on minimal vent settings.

   Assessment and Plan: 86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF p/w Left hip
   pain, adm to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for presumed urosepsis,   intubated on [**1-18**] for
   worsening acidosis and MS changes.
   #SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): presumed to be urosepsis with
   positive UA growing out pan sensitive Pseudomonas, now day 4 of Zosyn.
   Pt is s/p Intubation of [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis/MS changes, pt
   developped a worsening mixed acidosis & hypotension [**1-20**] with minimal
   vent support, switch to AC overnight & pH improved.  Hypotension did
   not resolve with 500cc bolus, required Levophed for apporx 5 hrs.
   Etiology of acidosis/hypotension unclear, possibly due to uremia,  NS
   resussitation and preload dependance given severe AS. Ruling out
   ongoing sepsis, further infectious work up neg to date, L chest U/S neg
   for abscess, CT unrevealing.  Bone scan pending today.
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] ID consult, continue Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas in
   urine, Vanc was d/c
d [**1-20**]
   - ortho consult for L  hip pain, bone scan pending today for ?mets
   - Blood Cx NGTD, Urine culture + 2 diff pseudomonas, both pan
   sensitive.  Sputum + yeast
   - gentle bolus of 250 LR prn to maintain Maps>65
   - will repeat cultures if any recurrence of hypotension
   #SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed Afib
   with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF &
   pressors.  Pt was intubated and pressors weaned. Pt has been in/out of
   Afib but HR better controlled on digoxin.  BP dropped overnight, did
   not respond to IV bolus, required pressors approx 5hrs.  This was
   likely due to severe AS and preload dependance but concern for ongoing
   sepsis.  Extravascular volume overload and complicated fluid balance,
   goal of net even i/os.
   - continue Digoxing 0.125mg every other day, avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA low
   - fluid bolus 250cc LR prn to maintain maps>60
   # RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis & MS
   changes.  CXR shows bilateral effusions & pulm edema.  CT showed
   possible airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration
   peri-intubation.  WBC ct increased at 14 today.  It is unlikely that
   this due to a new PNA, but will reculture and broaden Abx if pt
   clinically deteriorates.   Pulm edema and extravascular volume overload
   will likely be a barrier to extubation.  Goal to run i/os even, waiting
   on spontaneous diuresis.
   - repeat ABG in pm, consider weaning to [**8-28**] this evening
   - f/u RSBI in am, possible extubation over weekend
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with oliguric
   renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock.
   Urine sediment filled with WBCs, no e/o casts.  Creatinine increased
   slightly overnight, likely [**12-25**] contraction,  having increased UOP.
   [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] Renal recs, there is no acute indication for dialysis. Acidosis
   improved on vent with AC, unclear if metabolic acidosis leading to
   intubation was uremia vs NS resussitation.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] renal recs, waiting
   on natruriesis
   - monitor i/os, goal net even
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue phoslo TID
   # AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload dependant
   & delicate fluid balance.  Gentle bolus with 250cc LR prn to maintain
   MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status, avoid volume
   overload preventing successful extubation
   # URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of infection with UA +
   pseudomonas, pan sensitive
   - continue Zosyn renally dosed for coverage
   # LEFT HIP PAIN: Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] ortho recs.  Exam did not
   suggest a septic joint on admission, clearly very painful on
   manipulation.  CT neg for joint effusion, bone scan pending today
   - f/u ortho recs, continue Fentanyl for pain control

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF), who presented with left hip pain and was admitted to the ICU for presumed urosepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening acidosis and myocardial changes. She has a positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas, and is currently on day 4 of Zosyn. 

The patient developed hypotension and mixed acidosis on day 4, which did not resolve with a 500cc bolus and required the initiation of norepinephrine (Levophed) for approximately 5 hours. The etiology of the acidosis/hypotension is unclear, possibly due to uremia, NS resuscitation, and preload dependence given severe AS. Ongoing sepsis is being ruled out, and further infectious workup is negative. A bone scan is pending for possible metastases. 

The patient also has cardiogenic shock, likely due to severe AS and CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%, and has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's blood pressure dropped overnight and did not respond to an IV bolus, requiring pressors for approximately 5 hours. This was likely due to severe AS and preload dependence, but concern for ongoing sepsis exists. Extravascular"

   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating

   Active issues remains:
        Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis
   but is total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to
   extubation, urine output continues to improve and  will likely begin
   auto-diuresis phase of ATN, is likely somewhat preload dependant and in
   setting of positive pressure though at risk for significant flash pulm
   edema post extubation and resultant ischemia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, presenting with left hip pain and hypotension. She is currently in the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), acute renal failure (ATN), and respiratory failure.

The patient's condition has been improving overall, with improved acidosis and stable blood pressures. However, there are still active issues to address, including respiratory failure, total body volume management, and the risk of flash pulmonary edema post-extubation. The patient is expected to begin auto-diuresis phase of ATN and may require gentle diuretics later today.

The patient also has sepsis with pseudomonal urosepsis, which is improving but requires continued infection workup and antibiotic coverage with Zosyn for 14 days. Additionally, the patient has cardiogenic shock in the setting of a-fib with RVR and hypotension, along with severe AS. Fluid mobilization prior to extubation is necessary, taking into consideration preload dependence from AS.

Other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, which has reverted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with ectopy. The patient will continue on digoxin and daily stroke risk assessment will be performed. Anticoagulation is not currently indicated due to low platelet count at baseline, but may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is urosepsis, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. The patient is also suspected to have a urinary tract infection caused by pseudomonas, which is being treated with Zosyn. Additionally, the patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), specifically gynecological (ovarian, uterine, cervical, endometrial), and is experiencing hip pain that may be due to a possible metastatic lesion or fracture.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 149/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36/150 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 36/19 mEq/L, base excess (-4), and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) is 9.3 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) is 56 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) is 2.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 65 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) is 135 mEq/L, potassium (K+) is 4.0 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) is 28.9%, and lactate level is 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history includes severe aortic stenosis, renal cell and ovarian cancer, as well as a history of pain control. The patient's family history is significant for malignancy. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned respiratory and renal issues.

The patient's physical examination findings include crackles in both lung bases, warm extremities, no cyanosis, no clubbing, and normal neurologic examination. The patient's imaging studies show an et tube in place, underpenetrated, and a bone scan scheduled for hip pain assessment.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction), cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for presumed urosepsis. The patient has been intubated since January 18th due to worsening acidosis and myocardial stunning. She has been experiencing left hip pain, and her urine culture is positive for pseudomonas, which is sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's respiratory status has been improving, and she has been tolerating spontaneous breathing trials well. Her fluid balance is a concern, with ongoing extravascular volume overload. The patient's renal function is oliguric with improved creatinine levels. She is currently on diuretics and renal dosing of medications. The patient has a history of acute renal failure, possibly due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient was initially admitted for presumed urosepsis, and there is ongoing concern for infection, particularly with positive urine cultures for pseudomonas.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and became hypotensive on January 18th. The hypotension responded to intravenous fluids and pressors. The patient has been in and out of atrial fibrillation, but her heart rate is better controlled on digox"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF), admitted to the ICU for presumed urosepsis. She was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis and myocardial stunning. The patient's current condition includes sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, aortic stenosis, and urinary tract infection. She has been receiving various treatments and interventions to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. The infection seems to be originating from the urinary tract, as indicated by the positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas. Continuous monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severe AS and CHF have contributed to cardiogenic shock, characterized by impaired blood flow due to the heart's inability to pump effectively. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not managed properly. Maintaining adequate preload and afterload, as well as avoiding volume overload, is crucial for the patient's stability.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of her underlying lung condition and the recent aspiration peri-intubation"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca who presented
   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean
   Active issues remains:
   >Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis but is
   total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to extubation
        diurese, continue PS wean and follow abg, w/ hope to extubate in
   next 1-2 days
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving, suspect recurrent hypotensive episode overnight may have
   been secondary to volume shifts,
           Continue zosyn X 14 day course
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, resolved
       needs to mobilize fluids prior to extubation though recently
   hypotensive as has preload dependence from AS  also in setting of
   positive pressure
        Starting to autodiurese and will give lasix and thiazide today
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-
      Continue dig
      Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
        atn from sepsis and hypotension
        cr peaked/palteuad and now with increasing u/o--will likely start
   to auto-diurese and start thiazide and lasix (goal 500-1 L as BP
   tolerates)
        continue phos binder
        all meds renally dosed
   >  thrombocytopenia--on review of records, baseline thrombocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration
   and now likely at baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely,
   follow for further reduction from baseline, continue heparin products
   for now given low suspicion for HIT
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable,  likely component of hemodilution,
   transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if hypotension
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)--f/u on additional oncological hx
   > Hip pain--dose not seem source of infection but given her significant
   pain concern for some lytic lesion/fx or micro fx or bony mets-- bone
   scan negative

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis caused by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure due to sepsis and hypotension. 

The patient's current condition is improving, with improved acidosis and total body volume up. She is on mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow) with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. Her oxygen saturation is 100%. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis with pseudomonal urosepsis, cardiogenic shock due to severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure due to sepsis and hypotension, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. 

The plan for the patient includes continuing with Zosyn for a 14-day course, mobilizing fluids prior to extubation, weaning off positive pressure support, monitoring for recurrent hypotensive episodes, continuing digoxin for atrial"

   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean
   Active issues remains:
   >Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis but is
   total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to extubation
           continue PS wean and follow abg, w/ hope to extubate in next
   1-2 days after additional diuresis
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) atn from sepsis and
   hypotension
          Entering auto-diureses phase of atn and expect to start seeing
   improvement in creatinine, start thiazide and lasix (goal 500-1 L as BP
   tolerates)
         Continue phos binder and renal dosing of emds
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving
           Complete  zosyn X 14 day course
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, resolved
       needs to mobilize fluids prior to extubation though recently
   hypotensive as has preload dependence from AS  also in setting of
   positive pressure
        Starting to autodiurese and will give lasix and thiazide today
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-
      Continue dig
      Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
   >  thrombocytopenia--baseline thrombocytopenia in 50-70 range, with
   initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration and now likely at
   baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely,  follow for further
   reduction from baseline, continue heparin products for now given low
   suspicion for HIT
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable, transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if
   hypotension
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with left hip pain and was admitted for presumed urosepsis. The patient has been intubated since January 18th due to worsening acidosis and myocardial stunning. 

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with urosepsis, which is a severe infection caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream through the urinary tract. She was started on Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) but developed an allergic reaction. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, indicating a possible improvement in her sepsis. However, she still has positive cultures for pseudomonas in her urine and sputum.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has severe AS and CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%. She developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and became hypotensive on January 18th. The patient required intravenous fluids and pressors to stabilize her blood pressure. She has been in and out of atrial fibrillation but is better controlled on digoxin. The patient also experienced transient hypotension on January 20th, which required pressors for about 5 hours.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intub"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF p/w Left hip pain, adm to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for presumed urosepsis,  intubated on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis and
   MS changes.
   .
   #SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): etiology presumed urosepsis
   with positive UA growing out pan sensitive Pseudomonas, now day 7 of
   Zosyn.  Pt is s/p Intubation on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis/MS
   changes.  Pt had transient hypotensive episode with worsening acidosis
   on [**1-20**]-intermittently requiring pressors. WBC now trending down,
   afebrile, no recurrence of hypotension.  Further infectious work up neg
   to date, L chest U/S neg for abscess,Bone scan negative.
   - apprec ID consult, continue Zosyn day [**7-3**]
   - bone scan- no lytic lesions or metastatic dz
   - Blood Cx NGTD, Urine culture + 2 diff pseudomonas, both pan
   sensitive.  Sputum + yeast
   - gentle bolus of 250 LR prn to maintain Maps>65
   - will repeat cultures if any recurrence of hypotension
   .
   #SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed Afib
   with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF &
   pressors.  Pt was intubated and pressors weaned. Pt has been in/out of
   Afib but HR better controlled on digoxin.  Transiently hypotensive on
   [**1-20**], required pressors approx 5hrs, likely due to severe AS and
   preload dependence. Pt with extravasc volume overload and complicated
   fluid balance.
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg every other day, avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA
   very low
   - schedule metolazone and lasix daily, repeat in pm if volume up
   - EKG today
   .
   # RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis & MS
   changes.  CXR with effusions R>L & pulm edema.  CT showed possible
   airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration peri-intubation.
   WBC ct down, it is unlikely that this due to a new PNA, but will
   reculture and broaden Abx if pt clinically deteriorates.  Pulm edema
   and extravascular volume overload may be a barrier to extubation.
   - tolerated [**3-28**] well.  ABGs show normal acid base status, oxygenating &
   ventilating well.
   - RSBI 53, will attempt extubation today

   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with oliguric
   renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock.
   Creatinine improved & having increased UOP. Acidosis improved on vent
   with AC, unclear etiology of metabolic acidosis leading to intubation.
   Apprec renal recs,  will admin Lasix & Metolazone this am to attempt
   diuresis.  Improved urine output but Cr still well above baseline.
   - monitor i/os, goal net negative
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue phoslo TID

   # AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload dependant
   & delicate fluid balance.  Gentle bolus with 250cc LR prn to maintain
   MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status, avoid volume
   overload preventing successful extubation

   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds , ICU

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for left hip pain. She was intubated on 1/18 for worsening acidosis and myocardial stunning changes. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including urosepsis, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, aortic stenosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and left hip pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has led to systemic infection and sepsis. This can lead to further deterioration of organ function and potentially life-threatening complications.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severe AS and CHF have resulted in cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by impaired blood flow due to the heart's inability to pump effectively. This can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential multi-organ dysfunction.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to worsening acidosis and myocardial stunning changes. She is now showing signs of improvement with better oxygenation and ventilation but still has extravascular volume overload, making extubation challenging.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of"

   Active issues remains:
   > Respiratory failure
doing well w/ minimal vent support, alert and
   following commands, rsbi 50's and diuresing nicely.  CXR essentially
   stable with chronic changes at R base (h/o R pleurodesis)
          Check abg on PS 5/5 and if remains stable would extubate.
   Consider trial of NPPV if problems with oxygenation/chf post
   extubation
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) atn from sepsis and
   hypotension
         Entering auto-diureses phase of atn and expect to start seeing

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She is currently in the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis caused by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure (ATN), and respiratory failure. Her vital signs are stable, and she is responding well to diuretics. The patient's active issues include respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on minimal ventilatory support, but there is a concern for post-extubation complications such as oxygenation issues or congestive heart failure. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may be considered if these problems arise.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ATN): The patient is expected to continue improving as she enters the auto-diuresis phase of ATN. However, ongoing monitoring and management with thiazide and lasix diuretics, as well as renal dosing of medications, will be necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient has resolved pseudomonal urosepsis but remains at risk for further infections. Continued surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be essential.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: Although the patient's cardiogenic shock"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with pseudomonal urosepsis due to catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to sepsis and hypotension, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current condition is improving, with stable vital signs and respiratory support. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2 of 129 mmHg, and HCO3- of 23 mEq/L. Her WBC count is elevated at 14.7, indicating an infection. Her creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting impaired kidney function. Imaging shows increased right hemidiaphragm elevation with chronic changes from previous pleurodesis.

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient is improving and is on minimal vent support. ABG results show adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and the CXR is stable. The plan is to check ABG and consider extubation, with a possible trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) if needed.
2. Acute renal failure"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with left hip pain and was admitted to the hospital for presumed urosepsis. She required intubation on 1/18 due to worsening acidosis and MS changes, and was successfully extubated on 1/23. The patient has had several medical complications, including sepsis, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, and delirium. She is currently being treated with various medications and therapies to manage these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient previously had sepsis caused by a urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although the current infection seems to be under control, there is a possibility of recurrence.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient experienced cardiogenic shock due to severe AS and CHF. Although the shock has resolved, there is still a risk of cardiac complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure. Even though she has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory distress or further deterioration.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis. Continued monitoring of kidney function and appropriate management are necessary.

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the hospital for presumed urosepsis and subsequently intubated due to worsening acidosis and mitral valve changes. The patient had a transient hypotensive episode with worsening acidosis on January 20th, requiring pressors intermittently. Her white blood cell count is now trending down, she is afebrile, and there has been no recurrence of hypotension. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, aortic stenosis, urinary tract infection, and left hip pain. She is currently on various medications including metolazone, lasix, digoxin, and Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 116/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on invasive ventilation support and is extubated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She had pseudomonal urosepsis but has since resolved. The patient is currently stable since extubation with excellent ventilation and oxygenation. She has significant volume overload but is responding well to diuresis. Her chest X-ray appearance is stable (history of right pleurodesis). 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains at risk for respiratory failure but is currently stable since extubation.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF secondary to sepsis and hypotension, most likely caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is in the auto-diuresis phase of ATN and is expected to show improvement in creatinine. Diuretics will be continued, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 500-1 L, as tolerated by the patient's blood pressure. Phosphate binders and renal dosing of medications will also be continued.
3. Sepsis: The patient had severe sepsis with pseudomonal urosepsis, which is now resolved. Zosyn will be completed, and surveillance urine cultures will be repeated.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient experienced cardiogenic shock due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, renal cell and ovarian cancer. She presented with left hip pain and hypotension, and had resolved pseudomonal urosepsis caused by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (a-fib/RVR), acute renal failure (ARF) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and respiratory failure. The patient was previously intubated but is now extubated and stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which can recur if there is a deterioration in oxygenation or ventilation.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has ARF due to ATN. This condition can worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed, leading to further kidney damage or failure.

3. Sepsis: Although the pseudomonal urosepsis has resolved, the patient is still at risk for developing new infections or sepsis due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.

4. Cardiogenic shock: The patient had cardiogenic shock in the setting of a-fib with RVR and severe AS, which has since resolved. However, this condition can recur if the patient develops further cardiac issues.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with ectopy and is on"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with left hip pain and was admitted to the hospital for presumed urosepsis. She was intubated on [1-18] for worsening acidosis and successfully extubated on [1-23].

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Sepsis: Resolved, presumed urosepsis with positive urine analysis growing out Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She is currently receiving Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) intravenously.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has severe AS and CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%. She was aggressively diuresed and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A.Fib with RVR) overnight. She responded to intravenous bolus and beta-blockers. The patient has massive extravascular volume overload and will need to be slowly diuresed as she is very preload-dependent and tends to develop A.Fib with RVR when preload drops.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [1-18] due to worsening acidosis and mental status changes. Chest X-ray showed effusions (right greater than left) and pulmonary edema. CT scan showed possible airspace disease in the left lung fossa, indicating chronic changes likely due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the hospital for presumed urosepsis and intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis and MS changes. The patient successfully extubated on [**1-23**].

The patient has had several medical complications since admission. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with presumed urosepsis, which has since resolved. She was treated with Zosyn.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis and MS changes. She had effusions on the right side more than the left and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. A CT scan showed possible airspace disease in the right lower lobe, which could be related to aspiration peri-intubation or chronic changes due to right-sided pleurodesis. The patient successfully extubated on [**1-23**] and is currently on supplemental oxygen and diuretics.

3. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient had oliguric renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. Her urine output is currently improving. She is being administered Las"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with urosepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure due to sepsis and hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's condition has been stable since extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient experienced recurrent episodes of AFib overnight, which may continue due to significant diuresis and volume shifts. Close monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is necessary. Digoxin and beta-blockers should be continued, and Lasix may be administered as needed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has baseline thrombocytopenia in the range of 50-70,000/mm3. Although there was an initial elevation in platelet count, it is expected to normalize soon. Heparin products have been discontinued, and a HIT panel has been sent due to the slow drop in platelet count. However, the suspicion of HIT is low.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, likely caused by ICU stay, impaired sleep-wake cycle, and narcotics. Zyprexa should be continued, and efforts should be made to"

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She has resolved pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure (ATN), delirium, and respiratory failure. She is stable since extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent atrial fibrillation: The patient has had recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation overnight, likely due to significant diuresis and volume shifts. It is important to continue digoxin and beta-blockers as prescribed, monitor urine output, and adjust lasix as needed.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has baseline thrombocytopenia in the 50-70 range, with initial elevation likely from hemoconcentration. Since the heparin products were discontinued yesterday and the platelet count has improved and returned to baseline, there is low suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, it is important to monitor the platelet count regularly.

3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium in the ICU and impaired sleep-wake cycle, possibly due to narcotics. It is important to continue administering zyprexa, reorient the patient, optimize the sleep cycle at night, and limit narcotics.

4. Acute renal failure ("

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, presenting with left hip pain and hypotension. The patient had resolved pseudomonal urosepsis causing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), acute renal failure (ATN), delirium, and respiratory failure. She was extubated and remains stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) - The patient has recurrent AFib, which may continue and require further management with digoxin and beta-blockers.
2. Thrombocytopenia - The patient has low platelet count, which may be due to sepsis or other causes. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Delirium - The patient is experiencing delirium, possibly due to impaired sleep-wake cycle, narcotics, and other factors. Continuing with antipsychotic medication and optimizing sleep cycle at night is recommended.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ATN) - The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. Auto-diuresis phase of ATN is expected, and improvement in creatinine is anticipated. Phosphate binder and renal dosing of medications should be continued.
5. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction - The patient had severe pseudomonal urosepsis, now resolved. Completing"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the hospital with left hip pain and diagnosed with urosepsis. She underwent extubation on January 23rd and continues to experience intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and delirium.

Medical Complications:
1. AFib/CV: The patient has severe AS and CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%. She has been aggressively diuresed and developed AFib with RVR again overnight, responding to IV Lopressor. She started on Metoprolol 12.5mg and has extravascular volume overload but intravascularly dry. The patient is very preload-dependent and tends to develop AFib with RVR when preload drops. Diuretics are being held today, and respiratory status will be monitored. A chest X-ray will be obtained today to better evaluate lung fields.

2. SEPSIS/UTI: The patient's presumed urosepsis with UCx positive for Pseudomonas has resolved. She completed 10/10 days of Zosyn.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted for left hip pain and diagnosed with urosepsis. The patient had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR) and significant delirium. She was intubated on January 18th due to worsening acidosis and MS changes, but successfully extubated on January 23rd. 

The patient's WBC trended down, and she became afebrile with no recurrence of hypotension. Other infectious workup was negative, including a chest ultrasound and bone scan. Blood culture from the nasogastric tube and urine culture grew two different strains of Pseudomonas, both of which were pan-sensitive. Sputum was positive for yeast.

The patient has severe AS and CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%. She developed AFib w/ RVR again overnight and responded to intravenous Lopressor. She was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg. The patient has extravascular volume overload but intravascularly dry. She has a free water deficit of 1.5L/day and should continue slow diuresis. She is preload-dependent and tends to develop AFib w/ RVR when preload drops.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis and a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer. She presented with left hip pain and hypotension, which has resolved. She had pseudomonal urosepsis that was successfully treated. The patient's current issues include atrial fibrillation (AFIB), delirium, hypoxemia, hypernatremia, sacral abrasions, nutrition, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and hip pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent AFIB: The patient continues to experience episodes of AFIB. Monitoring urine output and administering Lasix as needed may help manage this condition. The patient's baseline low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, so anticoagulation therapy may be considered once clinical stability is achieved.
2. Delirium: The patient continues to experience delirium, characterized by altered mental status, especially in the evening (sundowning). Continuing with Zyprexa and reorientation can help manage this condition. Optimizing the sleep cycle at night and limiting narcotics may also be beneficial.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient is stable on minimal oxygen supplementation. Rechecking chest X-rays can provide further insights into the underlying cause.
4. Hypernatremia: Maintenance with D5 (5% dextrose) is recommended to address hypernatremia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis and a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer. She presented with left hip pain and hypotension, which has since resolved. The patient had pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure (ATN), delirium, and respiratory failure. She is currently stable since extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient experienced recurrent AFIB overnight. It is important to continue digoxin and started beta-blockers to manage this condition. Daily stroke risk assessment is low, so anticoagulation may not be necessary at this time.

2. Delirium: The patient continues to have delirium, which is a main issue. Large components include sundowning at night and an altered sleep schedule. It is important to continue with zyprexa, re-orientation, optimize sleep cycle at night, limit narcotics, and consult a delirium workup if not yet performed.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient is stable on minimal NC oxygen, but rechecking chest X-ray is necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit in the setting of NPO and diuresis. Maintenance with D5 should follow sodium levels.

5. Sacral abrasions: Wound care should be provided for the sacral"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure. She presented with left hip pain and was admitted to the ICU for urosepsis. She has been extubated since January 23rd and continues to experience intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been aggressively diuresed due to volume overload but remains intravascularly dry with a free water deficit of 2.5L and rising sodium levels. She is very preload-dependent and tends to develop atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response when preload drops. Diuretic therapy is being held today, and respiratory status will be monitored. A chest X-ray will be obtained to evaluate the lung fields. The patient is also on digoxin and metoprolol.

The patient's sepsis and urinary tract infection have resolved, and she completed 10 days of zosyn. She was intubated on January 18th for worsening acidosis and myocardial changes but successfully extubated on January 23rd. Her white blood cell count is down, and she is afebrile with no recurrence of hypotension. Other infectious workup is negative, including a left chest ultrasound that was negative for abscess and a bone scan that was negative. The patient's urine culture was positive for two different strains of pseudomonas, both of which were pan-sensitive, so she received 10 days of zosyn.

The patient also developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypoperfusion versus acute tubular necrosis in the setting of shock. Her urine output improved and responded well to lasix diuresis. Her sodium levels were corrected with D5W, but her creatinine rose overnight to 3.1. All diuretics were held, and appropriate urine output was maintained. The patient's renal function will be monitored closely, and medications will be dosed accordingly.

The patient was intubated on January 18th due to worsening acidosis and myocardial changes. A chest X-ray showed effusions that were more prominent on the right side and pulmonary edema. A CT scan showed airspace disease in the right lower lobe, likely chronic changes related to her history of right-sided pleurodesis. The patient was successfully extubated on January 23rd and is currently saturating well on 2 liters of nasal cannula. She will continue to receive supplemental oxygen and maintain even i/o status.

The patient has delirium likely secondary to intubation, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay. Her sleep/wake cycles are now very disturbed. All restraints have been removed, and she is being given olanzapine 2.5mg qam and 5mg qhs (haldol prn). Consideration is being given to a geriatric psychiatry consult, a sitter, and an echo. She is"

The patient underwent extubation on [**2163-1-23**] but experienced recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) this morning, resulting in hypotension that responded to repeated intravenous fluid boluses. 

The patient's current condition is characterized by several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient developed oliguric renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. The urine output improved with Lasix diuresis, but creatinine levels rose overnight.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis and multisystem organ dysfunction (MS) changes. A chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions with probable basilar atelectasis and engorgement of the pulmonary vessels. 

3. Delirium: The patient has delirium likely secondary to intubation, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay. Sleep/wake cycles are disturbed, and there is a concern for increased risk of aspiration.

4. Hypotension: The patient experienced recurrent hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with left hip pain and was admitted to the ICU for urosepsis. The patient had an episode of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation, but was successfully extubated on January 23rd. However, she developed recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) this morning, which was associated with hypotension and poor myocardial function. Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient remains hypotensive. The family decided to make her do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The patient also has renal failure, respiratory failure, and changes in mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening heart failure and recurrent AFib with RVR.
2. Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload and poor myocardial function.
3. Infection-related complications, including sepsis and pneumonia.
4. Renal failure due to hypoperfusion and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Thrombocytopenia, possibly related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
6. Pressure ulcers and skin breakdown due to immobility and decreased nutritional status.
7. Aspiration pneumonia due to altered mental"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with urosepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has shown improvement after completing a course of Zosyn antibiotic for 10 days.

The patient continues to experience recurrent atrial fibrillation (afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), acute renal failure (ARF) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sepsis and hypotension, delirium, and respiratory failure. The patient remains sensitive to volume shifts and appears preload-dependent. 

The active issues include hypotension, recurrent afib, anemia, hypoxemia, hypernatremia, sacral abrasions, nutrition, thrombocytopenia, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is on digoxin and has been holding beta-blockers due to hypotension. 

The patient's renal failure is managed with fluid and hemodynamic management as previously mentioned. Delirium continues to be a main issue, and the patient is on low-dose Zyprexa and Haldol PRN for re-orientation and optimizing sleep cycle. The patient is anticipated to have an extremely slow recovery.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, worsening respiratory failure"

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She has resolved pseudomonal urosepsis but now has recurrent atrial fibrillation (afib), hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension is likely cardiogenic in nature, possibly due to ischemia in the setting of severe AS and reduced cardiac output. Infection is also a possibility given the completion of antibiotics.

2. Volume shifts: The patient is sensitive to volume shifts and appears preload-dependent, as indicated by elevated jugular venous distention (JVD) and anasarca. This requires careful fluid management.

3. Renal failure: The patient has ARF due to ATN from sepsis and hypotension. This needs to be managed by optimizing hemodynamic stability and providing appropriate renal support.

4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be a component of sundowning at night and altered sleep schedule. It is important to continue low-dose antipsychotic medication, reorient the patient, optimize sleep cycle at night, limit narcotics, and provide supportive care.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia and requires"

   ECHO [**2163-1-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
   aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
   ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is a small pericardial
   effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with urosepsis and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A.fib with RVR) and hypotension, which responded to repeated intravenous fluid boluses. The patient has been extubated but remains confused and agitated. She is pulling out IVs and portacath. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 94/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's echocardiogram shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, low normal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 50%), and mild aortic regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's recurrent hypotension, likely of cardiogenic etiology, may lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and potential cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, as indicated by intubation on [1-18]. Although she was successfully extubated on [1-23], there is still an increased risk of respiratory failure due to the presence of"

   ECHO [**2163-1-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
   aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
   ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is a small pericardial
   effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2162-8-31**], the findings are similar.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. She has been in the ICU with a complicated and prolonged course, including resolved pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (a-fib/RVR), acute renal failure (ARF) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), delirium, and respiratory failure. The patient has recurrent episodes of a-fib, hypotension, and transient hypotension overnight. The family meeting yesterday resulted in a change of code status to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) and no lines or pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's recurrent hypotension is likely cardiogenic due to severe aortic stenosis and acute renal failure, but infection remains a possibility. Gentle IV fluid boluses and monitoring respiratory status should be continued.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF due to ATN secondary to sepsis and hypotension. Supportive care should be continued, with careful monitoring of creatinine levels and gentle hydration for blood pressure support. Diuretics should be held, and renal dosing of medications should be adjusted pending further improvement.
3. Delirium: The patient exhibits delirium with multiple contributing factors, including sun-downing at night"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She had resolved pseudomonal urosepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, acute respiratory failure, delirium, and acute renal failure (ATN) due to sepsis and hypotension. The patient's current issues include recurrent atrial fibrillation with ongoing difficulty optimizing vasovagal status in the setting of moderate-to-severe AS, hypotension likely due to cardiogenic causes with possible ischemia in the setting of severe AS and reduced CO, though infection possibility given completion of antibiotics. She also has renal failure, delirium, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has recurrent episodes of hypotension, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient's recurrent AF can increase the risk of thromboembolic events and may require anticoagulation therapy.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure (ATN) can progress to AKI, leading to worsening renal function and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium can impact her mental status and increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and other complications.
