   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decombensated heart failure and
   possible ACS vs. PE.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  EKG concerning for a STEMI with RCA lesion while on
   dobutamine last night.  CKs are flat and pt is unable to lay flat,
   requiring significant oxygen.  Now off Dobutamine and ECG changes
   resolved.
   -- will defer cath given difficulty laying flat and no acute infarct
   pattern currently.  Will continue to monitor ECGs and enzymes.  Will
   continue diuresis to optimize respiratory status prior to cath.
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin (concern for PE)
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- d/c integrillin as no immediate plan to go to cath
   -- hold metoprolol in the setting of decompensated heart failure
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of IMI
   .
   # PUMP:  Precipitous events of decompensated HF not particularly
   clear.  Recent chest pain, new TTE findings, and q-waves on EKG
   concerning for recent MI with worsening heart failure.  Cannot rule out
   possiblity of PE with exudate effusion.  Patient with elevated JVP,
   marked pulmonary edema/effusions, elevated BNP.  Unclear if there is an
   acute event that has worsened dyspnea, heart failure.   Pt responding
   to Lasix gtt with 450 out since midnight.
   - IV lasix gtt for diuresis
   - hold beta-blocker in the setting of decompensated HF
   - hold Lisinopril due to hypotension
   - f/u TTE today
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to decompensated heart
   failure, hypoxia.  Cannot rule out pulmonary embolis.  Will continue to
   treat these potential underlying causes.
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion: Differential includes PE, PNA or heart failure
   which is less likely given exudative effusion.  PE possible cause,
   which would unify right axis shift, hypoxia, and ST in this obese
   patient.
   - f/u lab studies from OSH with concerns for PNA
   - cont heparin gtt for possible PE
   - LENIs today, consider CTA to r/o PE
   - diureisis as described above
   .
   # Diabetes:  On Lantus 10 units qday and insulin sliding scale, holding
   glyburide.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  cont home sythroid.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presents with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome versus pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent. His temperature is within the normal range.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is tachypneic and diaphoretic, with morbid obesity. His general appearance is notable for decreased breath sounds on the left side, rales up to the apex, and decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung with rales. The cardiac examination shows muffled heart sounds and difficulty auscultating. The patient has early peaking of the S2 sound at the right upper sternal border (RUSB), and S1 and S2 are clearly heard. The lung examination findings suggest pulmonary edema and effusion. The abdomen is described as obese with pronounced panus, but no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly is noted. There are also findings of marked stasis dermatitis bilaterally.

The laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.3 mg/dL and blood glucose (Gl"

","The patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's EKG shows ST elevations in lead III, which could indicate an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, with only mild troponin elevation and normal creatine kinase (CK) at the onset of symptoms, ACS may not be the primary concern. The patient's reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20% on recent trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) suggests a previous myocardial infarction. The presence of pulmonary edema and effusions, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and jugular venous pressure (JVP) elevation indicate worsening heart failure.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a face tent with a SpO2 of 97%, and ABG results are not provided. The physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side, rales up to the apex on the left, and rales on the right side. There are no abdominal bruits or tenderness, but the patient has marked stasis dermatitis bilaterally.

   consistent w/ PE.  CKs are flat.  Pt. is significantly volume
   overloaded, continues to require oxygen, improved w/ diuresis.  Pt.
   continues to remain at high risk for PE given wt, sedentary lifestyle
   and relative immobility.  Pt. tolerated bbk well.
   -- will defer cath given flat enzymes.
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin and will transition to warfarin given
   high risk for PE (per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**]
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of past IMI

   # Pulmonary Effusion: Consistent w/ peri-pneumonic effusion.
   Differential includes PNA as most likely, malignancy or PE/heart
   failure which are less likely given exudative effusion.   Pt. w/
   effusion on CXR yest, unable to visualize posterior cardiac parenchyma,
   consolidation may be harboured there.  No hx consistent w/ PNA.  LENIs
   negative, but this has poor predictive value.   PE remains on
   differential, but pt is currently being treated.  Will evaluate further
   if no improvement in sx w/ diuresis and PNA tx.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presented with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome versus pulmonary embolism. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/37 mmHg to 116/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is tachypneic and diaphoretic, with morbid obesity. His neck veins are distended, and he has decreased breath sounds on both sides with rales. He also has stasis dermatitis bilaterally. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, and glucose. The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury. 

The assessment and plan include continuing diuresis to optimize respiratory status prior to cardiac catheterization, which has been deferred due to the patient's difficulty lying flat and lack of acute infarct pattern. The patient is also on aspirin, Plavix, and heparin due to concerns of possible pulmonary embolism. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, pulmonary edema,"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, possible pulmonary embolism (PE), and potential pneumonia (PNA). 

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and hypotension, with a blood pressure reading of 91/57 mmHg. The respiratory rate is normal at 24 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 94% with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.4 degrees Celsius.

The physical examination reveals a morbidly obese male who is tachypnic and diaphoretic. The heart sounds are muffled, and there are decreased breath sounds on the left side with crackles. The patient also has marked stasis dermatitis and lymphedema bilaterally, along with a left heel skin breakdown.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as high glucose levels. The white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal limits, but the platelet count is slightly low. Troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presents with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has risk factors such as morbid obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and relative immobility which increase the likelihood of PE. He is already being treated with anticoagulation therapy.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a pleural effusion consistent with a peri-pneumonic effusion, making pneumonia a possible differential diagnosis. He has already been started on levofloxacin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of heart failure, and there is a concern for volume overload, which can potentially lead to AKI. His urine output has been decreasing despite diuretic therapy.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which could be secondary to decompensated heart failure and hypoxia. There is also a concern for other arrhythmias due to the recent myocardial infarction.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and risk factors, there is a concern for the development"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presents with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia.

The patient's 24-hour events include continued diuresis with Lasix and Metolazone, a chest CT to assess for malignancy and further characterize parapneumonic effusion, which showed three loculated effusions in the left lobe. Aspirin was changed to 81mg, and the patient had a blood culture from a peripheral IV that grew Bacillus species, not anthrax. This was originally misreported as gram-positive cocci in chains, and the patient was started on vancomycin before being stopped after the results changed to gram-positive rods. No antibiotics were started. The patient is NPO for possible IR PICC placement, and Lasix gtt was increased from 2 to 5 for diuresis. The patient had a large bowel movement, and his nonproductive cough improved overnight. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or dyspnea on exertion.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 74 bpm (74-106 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 95/62mmHg (70/44"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia. He has been diagnosed with anemia, normocytic in nature, and his TSH levels are within normal limits. The patient is currently receiving treatment for pulmonary effusion, which may be due to pneumonia or atypical infection, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. He is also being treated for potential pulmonary embolism (PE) and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and decompensated heart failure puts him at risk for further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The presence of pulmonary effusion and opacities on chest CT suggests possible respiratory infections or inflammatory conditions. These may lead to worsening respiratory distress or the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient's risk factors, including obesity and immobilization, increase the likelihood of thromboembolic events like PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for a potential infection in the pleural effusion. There is a possibility of developing sepsis or experiencing worsening infection.

   Chief Complaint:
   69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD
   presenting with decombensated heart failure and likely demand
   ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decompensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  ECGs consistent with demand ischemia and enzymes flat.
   Cath deferred at this time.  Patient has been chest pain free.
   -- will defer cath given flat enzymes.
   -- d/c Plavix as not currently ACS
   -- continue heparin and transition to Coumadin given high risk for PE;
   will likely need life-long coumadin due to body habitus
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin and will transition to warfarin given
   high risk for PE (per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**]
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand;
   currently tolerating 12.5mg PO BID
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of past IMI
   -- change aspirin to 81mg due to anticoagulation and high bleeding risk
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion: Consistent w/ peri-pneumonic effusion.
   Differential includes PNA as most likely, malignancy or PE/heart
   failure which are less likely given exudative effusion.  No hx
   consistent w/ PNA.  LENIs negative, but this has poor predictive
   value.   PE remains on differential.
   - f/u updated lab studies from OSH today
   - follow-up PPD for ?TB
   - obtain Chest CT today to evaluate effusion further and potential for
   malignancy
   - Levofloxacin for 5 day course (day #1 = [**2164-11-24**]); today is day 2 of
   5.
   - diureisis as below
   - treat for PE with heparin and Coumadin
   # PUMP:  HF likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear
   precipitating factors.  Possibly he had recent ischemic event.  Patient
   with elevated JVP, marked pulmonary edema/effusions, elevated BNP.
   Urine output improved on Lasix gtt and Metolazone.   Hypoxia is
   improving.
   - continue Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis with goal -2 to 3
   liters today
   - f/u PM lytes
   - continue w/ beta-blocker to improve filling
   - holding Lisinopril due to hypotension

   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to decompensated heart
   failure, hypoxia.  Cannot rule out pulmonary embolis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presented with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia. The patient has been on diuresis with Lasix and Metolazone, and his urine output has improved. He is also receiving heparin and Coumadin for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis. The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored, and he is on a cardiac diet. His pain is being managed with Tylenol, and he is receiving bowel regimen with Colace, Senna, and Bisacodyl. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the CCU pending further diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's decompensated heart failure and demand ischemia put him at risk for further cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Pulmonary Complications: The presence of pulmonary edema, effusions, and airspace opacities on chest CT may indicate underlying pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Thromboembolic Events: Given the patient's risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), there is a potential for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary emb"
