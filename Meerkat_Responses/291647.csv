   54 M with long history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, A-fib on
   coumadin, s/p AVJ ablation, s/p pacemaker, s/p ICD, who was transferred
   from OSH for CHF management.
   .
   1. Pump: Patient has advanced systolic CHF with EF of 15-20%.
   Exacerbation likely [**1-11**] medication non-compliance given that he can't
   afford his medications or take care of himself.  Patient still appears
   volume overloaded. He continues to have orthopnea, ascites. However,
   decreased subjective shortness of breath hints that diuresis is going
   in the right direction. Plan for R heart cath today, as INR trended
   down to 2.7. Would consider starting milrinone after cath.
   -lasix gtt can restart as needed, with goal approximately 100cc/hour
   urine output
   -metolazone 5mg po bid
   -holding lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   -check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has no known CAD. Cardiomyopathy is chronic, and
   patient is non compliant with medications. However have not ruled out
   ischemic etiology of CHF. 3 sets of cardiac enzymes (0.07, 0.06, 0.07)
   have ruled patient out for an MI.
   -unless change in clinical status, can stop checking cardiac enzymes
   -ASA, statin
   -holding BB in the setting of hypotension and acute CHF exacerbation
   .
   # RHYTHM:  patient has history of VT, atrial tachycardia, afib s/p
   ablation and ICD implant. Currently V paced.
   -monitor on telemetry
   -digoxin restarted at home dose, following check of digoxin level; per
   pharmacy, recheck digoxin level a few days after admission
   .
   #  Anticoagulation: INR 4.0 on admission, on coumadin for afib. Were
   unable to perform procedures such as catheterization, central line
   insertion, abdominal paracentesis given INR. Hesitant to give FFP given
   additional volume would likely worsen heart failure. INR trending down.
   Per cardiology, one unit FFP this morning and then one unit FFP on hold
   during cath.
   -hold coumadin again today; consider restart this afternoon after cath
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2.1?. Cr on admission
   3.1. Improved from 4.1 at OSH. This morning, 2.3. Likely [**1-11**] poor
   forward flow.

   congestive hepatopathy. No abdominal pain, leukocytosis, or fevers that
   would be concerning for SBP.
   -consider therapeutic paracentesis once INR < 1.7

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and previous AVJ ablation, pacemaker, and ICD implantation. He was transferred for congestive heart failure (CHF) management. The patient has advanced systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The exacerbation of CHF is likely due to medication non-compliance. He appears to be volume overloaded with symptoms of orthopnea and ascites. However, there is a decrease in subjective shortness of breath, indicating that diuresis is going in the right direction. The plan is to proceed with a right heart catheterization today as the INR trended down to 2.7. Milrinone may be considered after the catheterization. Lasix can be restarted as needed with a goal of approximately 100cc/hour urine output. Metolazone 5mg po bid will also be initiated. Lisinopril will be held in the setting of acute renal failure. Electrolytes will be checked at [Hospital1]. 

Coronaries: The patient has no known coronary artery disease. Cardiomyopathy is chronic, and non-compliance with medications has not been ruled out as an ischemic etiology of CHF. Three sets of cardiac enzymes have ruled out an acute myocardial infarction. ASA and statin therapy will be continued,"

He was admitted for management of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient has advanced systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The exacerbation is likely due to medication non-compliance. 

During the stay, the patient received diuretics and was successfully weaned off the lasix drip. However, there was concern for electrolyte abnormalities due to aggressive diuresis. The patient also experienced a small nosebleed. 

Vital signs were relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/69 to 109/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's heart rhythm was ventricular paced, and he required supplemental oxygen. Fluid balance showed an intake of 692 mL, output of 3,960 mL, and a negative balance of -3,268 mL. 

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood chemistries revealed elevated creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and liver enzymes. Electrolytes were within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and previous procedures including AVJ ablation, pacemaker, and ICD implant. He was admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/69 to 109/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

The patient appears to be volume overloaded with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) to the mandible, orthopnea, ascites, and lower extremity edema. He is planned for a right heart catheterization today due to a declining INR trend. 

Laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin-T levels. Other lab results are within normal limits or stable from prior admission. 

The patient has advanced systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The plan includes restarting lasix gtt as needed, metolazone, holding lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure, and considering starting milrinone after cardiac cath"

He is being ventilated with a tidal volume of 650 mL and has a urine output of 3,960 mL since midnight.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 5.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 179 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL, and troponin T level of 0.07 ng/mL.

The patient's medical history includes long-standing idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. He has experienced an exacerbation of congestive heart failure, likely due to medication non-compliance. The patient appears volume overloaded, with jugular venous distention elevated to the mandible, orthopnea, ascites, and lower extremity edema. A right heart catheterization is planned today due to the trend of INR down to 2.7. Milrinone may be considered after the catheterization.

Other issues include acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, chronic hepatitis C, and potential congestive hepatopathy. The patient's INR is currently being monitored, and therapeutic paracentesis may be considered once the INR is below 1.7. Additionally, the patient is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and venous-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 M with long history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, A-fib on
   coumadin, s/p AVJ ablation, s/p pacemaker, s/p ICD, who was transferred
   from OSH for CHF management.
   .
   1. Pump: Patient has advanced systolic CHF with EF of 15-20%.
   Exacerbation likely [**1-11**] medication non-compliance given that he can't
   afford his medications or take care of himself.  Patient still appears
   volume overloaded. He continues to have orthopnea, ascites. However,
   decreased subjective shortness of breath hints that diuresis is going
   in the right direction. Plan for R heart cath today, as INR trended
   down to 2.7. Would consider starting milrinone after cath.
   -lasix gtt can restart as needed, with goal approximately 100cc/hour
   urine output
   -metolazone 5mg po bid
   -holding lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   -check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has no known CAD. Cardiomyopathy is chronic, and
   patient is non compliant with medications. However have not ruled out
   ischemic etiology of CHF. 3 sets of cardiac enzymes (0.07, 0.06, 0.07)
   have ruled patient out for an MI.
   -unless change in clinical status, can stop checking cardiac enzymes
   -ASA, statin
   -holding BB in the setting of hypotension and acute CHF exacerbation
   .
   # RHYTHM:  patient has history of VT, atrial tachycardia, afib s/p
   ablation and ICD implant. Currently V paced.
   -monitor on telemetry
   -digoxin restarted at home dose, following check of digoxin level; per
   pharmacy, recheck digoxin level a few days after admission
   .
   #  Anticoagulation: INR 4.0 on admission, on coumadin for afib. Were
   unable to perform procedures such as catheterization, central line
   insertion, abdominal paracentesis given INR. Hesitant to give FFP given
   additional volume would likely worsen heart failure. INR trending down.
   Per cardiology, one unit FFP this morning and then one unit FFP on hold
   during cath.
   -hold coumadin again today; consider restart this afternoon after cath
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2.1?. Cr on admission
   3.1. Improved from 4.1 at OSH. This morning, 2.3. Likely [**1-11**] poor
   forward flow.
   -mucomyst prior to c. cath today
   -trend Cr
   -renally dose meds (digoxin)
   -hold lisinopril
   .
   #  Normocytic Anemia: HCT 29.4. MCV of 95. Stable from prior admission.
   -follow-up B12 and folate
   -guaiac stools
   .
   #  Chronic hepatitis C: Patient has ascites, elevated LFTs (improved
   today), all stable or improved from prior hospitalization. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-11**]
   congestive hepatopathy. No abdominal pain, leukocytosis, or fevers that
   would be concerning for SBP.
   -consider therapeutic paracentesis once INR < 1.7
   -trend LFTs. If worsening, would consider further work up.
   .
   FEN:  NPO until cardiac catheterization today. Replete lytes PRN (No K
   or Mg needed this AM).

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   for rhc today.  Wil plan to continue milrinone out of cath lab and
   implement maximal diuresis.  He has already put out > 4 liters net in
   18 hours so I expect that we can volume unload him efficaciously
   without putting him in any worswe renal failure.  He has perhaps
   upwards of 20 liters of extravascular fluid (edema and third space) to
   get rid of.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and previous procedures such as AVJ ablation, pacemaker, and ICD implant. He was admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation and has been receiving diuretics, lasix, and metolazone. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/69 to 109/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support. Physical examination revealed rales at the lung bases, no pedal edema, chronic venous stasis changes in the lower extremities, abdominal distention, and mild hepatomegaly.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count compared to previous measurements. Other labs including kidney function tests, electrolytes, cardiac enzymes, and liver function tests are within normal limits or stable. The patient has an INR of 2.7, which is below the therapeutic range for anticoagulation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pump dysfunction due to advanced systolic heart failure with ejection fraction of 15-20%. Exacerbation likely due to medication non-compliance. The patient appears to"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a long history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and previous procedures including AVJ ablation, pacemaker, and ICD implant. He was transferred from another hospital for management of congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current condition includes advanced systolic CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. He appears volume overloaded, with an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) to the mandible. He also has orthopnea, ascites, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The plan is to perform a right heart catheterization tomorrow due to an elevated INR of 4.0. Milrinone may be considered after the catheterization.

The patient's coronary arteries are not known to be diseased, but the etiology of his CHF has not been ruled out. His rhythm is currently ventricular-paced due to a history of ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation post-ablation, and ICD implant. Telemetry monitoring is ongoing, and digoxin is being held due to acute renal failure (ARF).

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and previous cardiac catheterization. He presented to the ICU with symptoms of sepsis and acute kidney injury. The patient underwent an EKG and cardiac catheterization, and a PA catheter was inserted. His condition has been monitored closely, with frequent lab tests and vital sign measurements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's urine culture showed the presence of ESBL Kleb, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. This can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is currently showing signs of worsening renal function. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac history includes atrial fibrillation and previous cardiac catheterization. These factors increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Respiratory Issues: The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula, indicating possible respiratory distress or impaired gas exchange. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and ABG results is necessary.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent DVT formation"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   1. Pump: Patient has advanced systolic CHF with EF of 15-20%.
   Exacerbation likely [**1-11**] medication non compliance given that he can't
   afford his medications or take care of himself.  Patient currently
   appears volume overloaded, with JVP elevated to the mandible.  He
   continues to have orthopnea, ascites, and LE edema. Plan for R heart
   cath tomorrow, as INR currently 4.0. Would consider starting milrinone
   after cath in addition to Lasix drip.   Negative 1.7L overnight since
   initiation of diuresis.
   -Will wedge today to assess volume status
   -Continue Lasix gtt 3.5mg/hr to goal wedge 22, goal -2-3L/day
   -Continue Milrinone
   -Continue Metolazone 5mg po bid
   -holding lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   -check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has no known CAD. Cardiomyopathy is chronic, and
   patient is non compliant with medications. However have not ruled out
   ischemic etiology of CHF.
   -NPO for possible cath today
   -ASA, statin
   -holding BB in the setting of hypotension and acute CHF exacerbation
   .
   .
   # RHYTHM:  patient has history of VT, atrial tachycardia, afib s/p
   ablation and ICD implant. Currently V paced.
   -monitor on telemetry
   -Hold Coumadin today
   -hold digoxin given ARF. Will check dig level prior to continuing at
   current dose.
   .
   #  Anticoagulation: INR 4.0, on coumadin for afib. Unable to perform
   procedures such as catheterization, central line insertion, abdominal
   paracentesis given current INR. Hesitant to give FFP given additional
   volume would likely worsen heart failure.
   -hold coumadin
   -Vitamin K
   -f/u INR in AM
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2.1?. Cr improving with
   diuresis. Improved from 4.1 at OSH. Likely [**1-11**] poor forward flow.
   -mucomyst prior to c. cath tomorrow
   -trend Cr. If worsening, would send urine lytes.
   -renally dose meds (digoxin)
   -hold lisinopril
   .
   #  Normocytic Anemia: HCT 30.8. MCV of 97. Stable from prior admission.
   -check B12 and folate
   -guaiac stools
   -f/u Thyroid function as outpatient
   .
   #  Chronic hepatitis C: Patient has ascites, elevated LFTs, all stable
   or improved from prior hospitalization. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-11**] congestive
   hepatopathy. No abdominal pain, leukocytosis, or fevers that would be
   concerning for SBP.
   -consider therapeutic paracentesis once INR < 1.7
   -trend LFTs. If worsening, would consider further work up.
   .
   .
   FEN:  Heart healthy diet. Replete lytes PRN
   .
   ACCESS: PIV
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx -INR 4.0
   -Pain management with tylenol PRN
   -Bowel regimen with  senna, colace
   .
   CODE: FULL confirmed with patient

His liver function tests (LFTs) have been trending down, so an increased bowel regimen will be implemented. The patient's right heart cath yesterday showed concerning diastolic dysfunction and elevated pulmonary artery pressures.

The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrial tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB) after ablation and ICD implantation. Currently, the patient is ventricularly paced. The patient's INR is currently 4.0, which is higher than the desired range for procedures such as catheterization. The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) level was 2.1, and it is improving with diuresis. The patient is also experiencing normocytic anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 30.8, and the MCV is stable from prior admission. The patient's chronic hepatitis C is stable or improved from prior hospitalization, but there are concerns about congestive hepatopathy. The patient has ascites and elevated LFTs.

The patient is currently on Lasix drip, milrinone, metolazone, and holding lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure. The patient is also on ASA and statin, and holding beta-blockers (BB) in the setting of hypotension and acute CHF exacerbation. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is currently in the CCU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's advanced systolic CHF and current symptoms suggest a high risk of worsening heart failure.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of VT, atrial tachycardia, and AFIB. There is a risk of developing further arrhythmias, especially in the setting of electrolyte imbalances.
3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was elevated, and there is a risk of further renal deterioration due to decreased renal perfusion.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's chronic hepatitis C and ascites increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic illnesses and medications increases the risk of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infection.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and underlying cardiomyopathy increase the risk"

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a long history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who has undergone AVJ ablation, pacemaker implantation, and ICD implantation. He was transferred from another hospital for management of congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 109/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is in ventricular paced rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-dressed male in no acute distress. He is oriented x3 with appropriate mood and affect. He has scleral icterus, but conjunctivae are pink without pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. His jugular venous pressure (JVP) is elevated to the mandible while sitting up in bed. There are no murmurs, crackles diffusely bilaterally, and no wheezes or rhonchi. His abdomen is soft, non-tender with marked distention, and positive fluid wave. There is no hepatomegaly or abdominal bruits. He has 2+ lower extremity (LE) edema bilaterally and thickened hard skin on his LE. His pulses are all present and palpable.

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a long history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, status post AVJ ablation, s/p pacemaker, and s/p ICD. He was transferred from another hospital for congestive heart failure management.

The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including renal failure, chronic hepatitis C, normocytic anemia, and an increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His current condition includes advanced systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%, exacerbation likely due to medication noncompliance. The patient appears to be volume overloaded, with an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and signs of congestion such as orthopnea, ascites, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated levels of bicarbonate, potassium, and liver enzymes. His creatinine level has increased from 2.1 to 3.1, indicating worsening renal function. Other lab results indicate abnormal levels of cardiac markers, electrolytes, and liver function tests.

The plan of care involves several interventions, including right heart catheterization tomorrow, adjusting diuretics and medications, monitoring renal function, holding certain medications due to acute renal failure, and managing pain and bowel movements. The patient's anticoagulation therapy needs to be reassessed due to an elevated INR of 4.0, and vitamin K"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and previous ablation and pacemaker/ICD implantation. He was admitted to the ICU for congestive heart failure management. The patient has advanced systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. He appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP, orthopnea, ascites, and bilateral lower extremity edema. His laboratory results show elevated BUN, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's INR is currently 4.0, and he has a negative 1.7L overnight since initiation of diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pump Failure: The patient's advanced systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 15-20% puts him at high risk for pump failure. Close monitoring and aggressive management are required.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a baseline creatinine of 2.1 and an improving trend. It is important to trend his creatinine levels and consider renal dosing of medications, especially digoxin. Holding lisinopril is also appropriate in the setting of ARF.
3. Bleeding Risk: The patient's INR is currently 4.0, which increases the risk of bleeding. Holding coumadin and administering vitamin K will be necessary. Procedures such as catheterization"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and previous ablation and pacemaker/ICD placement. He was admitted to the ICU for management of congestive heart failure (CHF). 

During his stay, the patient has shown several medical complications. Firstly, he has advanced systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. This is likely due to medication noncompliance as he cannot afford his medications or take care of himself. The patient appears volume overloaded, with an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) to the mandible, orthopnea, ascites, and lower extremity edema. A right heart catheterization is planned for tomorrow, and consideration will be given to starting milrinone after the catheterization in addition to the lasix drip. 

Secondly, the patient has chronic hepatitis C, which is evident from his elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and ascites. There are no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). A therapeutic paracentesis may be considered once the INR is below 1.7.

Thirdly, the patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with an initial creatinine level of 2.1. The renal function is improving with diuresis, and the patient's urine output is stable. Further evaluation of renal function will be done, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal discomfort. He has a history of advanced systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The patient is volume overloaded, experiencing orthopnea, ascites, and lower extremity edema. He underwent a right heart catheterization and is being diuresed well, with a negative fluid balance of greater than 4 liters yesterday. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 118/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin concentration of 30.8 g/dL, platelet count of 179,000/mm³, creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL, and glucose level of 117 mg/dL. Other lab values are provided in the note.

Plan:
1. Pump: Continue diuresis with Lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 2-3 liters per day. Continue Milrinone infusion. Plan to perform a wedge to assess volume status.
2. Coronaries: Patient has no known coronary artery disease (CAD), but cardiomyopathy is chronic, and medication non-compliance has been identified. However, the ischemic et"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 93-year-old male with advanced systolic heart failure (ejection fraction of 15-20%) and a history of non-compliance with medications. He presents with symptoms of volume overload, including elevated jugular venous pressure, orthopnea, ascites, and lower extremity edema. The patient has undergone a right heart catheterization and is currently being diuresed. 

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. His temperature is slightly below normal. The patient is receiving infusions of furosemide and milrinone, as well as oral metolazone. Lisinopril has been held due to acute renal failure.

The patient's lab results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and liver enzymes. The patient's creatinine levels are improving from a previous admission. Troponin T levels are within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pump: The patient has advanced systolic CHF with EF of 15-20%. Exacerbation likely due to medication non-compliance. The patient appears volume overloaded, with JVP elevated to the mandible. He continues to have orthopnea, ascites, and LE edema. S/P R heart cath. Diuresing well. 
   -Will wedge today to assess volume status
   -Continue Lasix gtt to goal"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of advanced systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%.
- The patient's current symptoms include orthopnea, ascites, and sacral edema, indicating volume overload.
- The patient has undergone a right heart catheterization and is being diuresed with Lasix to remove excess fluid.
- Medication non-compliance is suspected as the cause of the exacerbation, as the patient cannot afford their medications or take care of themselves.
- The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and has undergone an ablation and ICD implantation. Currently, the patient is being paced at the ventricular level.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated baseline creatinine level. The creatinine is improving with diuresis.
- The patient has normocytic anemia with a hematocrit drop of 4 points and is experiencing epistaxis. A blood transfusion is planned to address the anemia.
- The patient has chronic hepatitis C with ascites and elevated liver function tests, but no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits.
- The patient's temperature is slightly below the normal"

   failure (LVEF = 20%) who was admitted with an exacerbation of his
   symptoms.   He underwent tailored therapy with an indwelling PA
   catheter line and IV milrinone and IV furosemide.   He is currently on
   digoxin.  Over 10 L of diuresis was obtained.
   We are currently proceeding with continued diuresis in order to
   mobilize the remaining edema of his thighs and sacrum.  We anticipate
   that at least 5L of diuresis may remain, but are watching his
   orthostatic BPs and creatinine carefully.
   Symptomatically, he has responded with an improvement in his symptoms.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with advanced systolic heart failure (LVEF = 20%) and a history of diastolic heart failure. He presented with an exacerbation of his symptoms and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been on aggressive diuresis, including Lasix and milrinone, to manage his volume overload. He has shown improvement in his symptoms, but still has some residual edema. The patient's code status is FULL confirmed with the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has advanced systolic heart failure, which can lead to further deterioration in cardiac function.
2. Fluid overload: Despite aggressive diuresis, the patient still appears to be volume overloaded, which can increase the risk of complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening renal function.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently experiencing acute renal failure due to poor forward flow. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Bleeding: The patient had a nosebleed this morning, which may be related to the use of anticoagulant medications. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding or coagulopathy is essential.
5. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, and there is a risk of further blood loss or transfusion complications.
6. Hepatic complications: The patient has chronic hepatitis C and ascites. Monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction or"

   ATTENDING CCU DAILY PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I concur with the
   history, physical examination, assessment and treatment plan.   Mr.
   [**Known lastname 957**] is a 54 year old man with known diastolic and systolic heart
   failure (LVEF = 20%) who was admitted with an exacerbation of his
   symptoms.   He underwent tailored therapy with an indwelling PA
   catheter line and IV milrinone and IV furosemide.   He is currently on
   digoxin.  Over 10 L of diuresis was obtained.
   We are currently proceeding with continued diuresis in order to
   mobilize the remaining edema of his thighs and sacrum.  We anticipate
   that at least 5L of diuresis may remain, but are watching his
   orthostatic BPs and creatinine carefully.
   Symptomatically, he has responded with an improvement in his symptoms.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1914**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7145**] [**Pager number 10477**]
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of diastolic and systolic heart failure, currently admitted with an exacerbation of symptoms.
- The patient underwent a right heart catheterization and is being treated with tailored therapy including IV milrinone and IV furosemide.
- The patient has shown improvement in symptoms, with over 10 liters of diuresis obtained.
- The treatment plan includes continued diuresis to mobilize remaining edema, monitoring orthostatic BPs and creatinine levels, and adjusting medications as needed.
- The patient's condition is stable, with ongoing management and close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient appears volume overloaded, as indicated by the presence of orthopnea, ascites, and sacral edema. This can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and increased risk of complications such as pulmonary edema or acute kidney injury.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently experiencing worsening renal function. Continued monitoring of creatinine levels and adjustment of medications accordingly will be important to prevent further deterioration.
3. Bleeding: The patient had a nosebleed this morning, which could be related to his history of normocytic anemia or the use of anticoagulant medications. Close monitoring for any signs of bleeding or clotting disorders is necessary.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for"

   was present for all portions of this physical examination.  Mr. [**Known lastname 957**]
   is a 54 year old man with known diastolic and systolic heart failure
   (LVEF = 20%) who was admitted with an exacerbation of his symptoms.
   He underwent tailored therapy with an indwelling PA catheter line and
   IV milrinone and IV furosemide.   He is currently on digoxin.
   An additional 3.5 L diuresis was obtained yesterday on the medical
   regimen of digoxin, milrinone, IV furosemide, and intermittent
   Diamox.   There is some reduction of the degree of edema in his thighs
   and sacrum.
   Symptomatically, he has responded with an improvement in his
   symptoms.   Epistaxis has resolved and has not recurred.  His
   creatinine has remained stable at 1.4 mg/dL.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, EF <20%, atrial fibrillation post AV node ablation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted for recurrent ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in the setting of decompensated heart failure. The patient also has severe tricuspid regurgitation and marked biventricular dilation.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, volume overload, and acute renal failure. He has been diuresing well on Lasix drip and Milrinone. The plan includes continuing Lasix to goal wedge 22, continuing Milrinone, Metolazone 5mg po bid, and Digoxin. Lisinopril and Metoprolol are being held due to acute renal failure. The patient's electrolytes should be checked, and potassium should be repleted with a goal closer to 5. Metabolic alkalosis caused by diuresis should be managed with Diamox 500mg po daily for a limited number of days. Orthostatics should be checked.

The patient has no known coronary artery disease, but chronic cardiomyopathy and noncompliance with medications have not been ruled out as the etiology of CHF. ASA and statin therapy should be initiated. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors should be held in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Briefly, 54 yo M w/ nonischemic CMP, EF <20%, AF s/p AVJ ablation (on
   coumadin), s/p PPM/ICD, severe TR, recently admitted for recurrent
   VT/VF in setting of decompensated heart failure (d/c [**9-2**]), who was
   readmitted [**9-8**] in volume overload and with ARF.. Recent echo showed EF
   <20%, global severe HK, severe TR, and marked biventricular dilation.
   Discharged for 2d to rehab, but signed out AMA to his rooming home,
   where he was unable to care for himself. On admit he was found to be
   volume overloaded, with increased Cr and hypotension. He went to cath
   lab [**9-8**] that showed elevated filling pressure with pulmonary
   hypertension. He was started on milrinone and lasix gtt and admitted to
   CCU.
 # Pump: Patient has advanced systolic CHF with EF of 15-20%.
   Exacerbation likely [**1-11**] medication non compliance given that he can't
   afford his medications or take care of himself.  Patient has been
   diuresing well, nearing dry weight but still appears with sacral edema.
   S/P right heart cath, diuresing well on Lasix drip and Milrinone.
   -Continue Lasix gtt to goal wedge 22, goal: negative another 2.5L/day
   -Continue Milrinone, Metolazone 5mg po bid, Digoxin
   -Holding Lisinopril and Metoprolol in the setting of acute renal
   failure
   -Check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes, replete K with goal closer to 5
   -Metabolic alkalosis d/t diuresis: Diamox (acetazoladmie) 500mg po
   daily, but for a limited # of days (first day was [**9-10**])
   -Check orthostatics

   patient is non compliant with medications. However have not ruled out
   ischemic etiology of CHF.
   -ASA, statin
   -Holding BB, ACEi in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation
   .
   # RHYTHM:  patient has history of VT, atrial tachycardia, afib s/p
   ablation and ICD implant. Currently V paced.   Coumadin for a fib held
   initially as supratherapeutic previously.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -Continue digoxin
   -Restart Coumadin at home dose
   .
   # Nosebleed:  Anterior nosebleed, will pack and ensure hemostasis.
   Resolved with anterior packing, ok to re-start Coumadin.
   - Continue Oxymetazoline nose spray
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2.1?. Cr improving with
   diuresis, likely [**1-11**] poor forward flow.
   -Renally dose meds (digoxin)
   -Holding Lisinopril
   -Continue diuresis with Lasix drip for today as above
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia: HCT 30.8. MCV of 97. Hct drop of 4 points. Has
   epistaxis this AM, was transfused 1 unit PRBC.
   -check folate (B12 >nl.)
   -continue to guiac stool
   -f/u thyroid function as outpatient
   .
   # Chronic hepatitis C: Patient has ascites, elevated LFTs, all stable
   or improved from prior hospitalization. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-11**] congestive
   hepatopathy. No abdominal pain, leukocytosis, or fevers that would be
   concerning for SBP.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction less than 20%, atrial fibrillation after ablation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), severe tricuspid regurgitation, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in the setting of decompensated heart failure. He was previously admitted for volume overload and acute renal failure. The patient has advanced systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%.

Recent findings include global severe hypokinesis, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and marked biventricular dilation. The patient was discharged for two days to rehabilitation but signed out against medical advice (AMA) to his rooming home, where he was unable to care for himself. On admission, he was found to be volume overloaded with increased creatinine and hypotension. A right heart catheterization showed elevated filling pressures with pulmonary hypertension. He was started on milrinone and Lasix drip and admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU).

The patient is currently being treated with diuretics, milrinone, metolazone, digoxin, and holding lisinopril and metoprolol due to acute renal failure. He also has a history of chronic hepatitis C, normocytic anemia, and chronic hepatitis C. The patient's current vital signs"

   VT/VF in setting of decompensated heart failure (d/c [**9-2**]), who was
   readmitted [**9-8**] in volume overload and with ARF.. Recent echo showed EF
   <20%, global severe HK, severe TR, and marked biventricular dilation.
   Discharged for 2d to rehab, but signed out AMA to his rooming home,
   where he was unable to care for himself. On admit he was found to be
   volume overloaded, with increased Cr and hypotension. He went to cath
   lab [**9-8**] that showed elevated filling pressure with pulmonary
   hypertension. He was started on milrinone and lasix gtt and admitted to
   CCU.
 # Pump: Patient has advanced systolic CHF with EF of 15-20%,
   presented with CHF exacerbation likely [**1-11**] medication non-compliance.

   # RHYTHM:  patient has history of VT, atrial tachycardia, afib s/p
   ablation and ICD implant. Currently V paced.   Coumadin for a fib held
   initially as supratherapeutic previously, currently re-started with
   sub-therapeutic INR.  Monitor INR and anticipate increase to
   therapeutic level over the next several days.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -Continue digoxin
   -Continue Coumadin at home dose

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   srtill diuresing well off milrinone and on drastically reduced Lasix
   gtt (now at 3 mg per hour); these are very good signs
   we will transfer him to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 and arrange for rehab (he is homeless)

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 20%, atrial fibrillation (AF) after ablation, implantable pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (PPM/ICD), severe tricuspid regurgitation, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) in the setting of decompensated heart failure. He was previously discharged but returned to the hospital due to volume overload and acute renal failure (ARF). Recent echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular dysfunction, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and marked biventricular dilation. The patient is currently admitted to the CCU for exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to medication noncompliance. He has been diuresing well on Lasix and Milrinone and is nearing dry weight.

The patient has multiple medical complications including advanced systolic CHF, recent onset of ARF, severe TR, and chronic hepatitis C with ascites. He also has normocytic anemia with a recent drop in hemoglobin concentration and a history of epistaxis, for which he received a blood transfusion. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and he is on various medications including digoxin, metolazone, spironolactone, and holding lisinopril in the setting of ARF. His INR is being monitored, and Coumadin has been restarted with a subtherapeutic level. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently on CCU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening CHF, further decline in renal function, development of arrhythmias, and progression of liver disease."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction less than 20%, atrial fibrillation post atrioventricular junction ablation (on Coumadin), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He also has severe tricuspid regurgitation and was recently admitted for recurrent ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in the setting of decompensated heart failure. The patient was discharged from the hospital but returned on [**9-8**] in volume overload and with acute renal failure. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of less than 20%, global severe hypokinesis, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and marked biventricular dilation.

The patient's current medications include Coumadin, Metolazone, Digoxin, and holding Lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure. The plan is to continue Lasix drip until a goal of 1 liter negative fluid balance today, nearing dry weight. Milrinone will be discontinued today. The patient's recent right heart catheterization showed elevated filling pressures with pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has advanced systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20% and presented with exacerbation likely due to medication non-compliance. The patient is diuresing well on Lasix drip and Milrinone, nearing dry"

   Assessment and Plan
   Briefly, 54 yo M w/ nonischemic CMP, EF <20%, AF s/p AVJ ablation (on
   coumadin), s/p PPM/ICD, severe TR, recently admitted for recurrent
   VT/VF in setting of decompensated heart failure (d/c [**9-2**]), who was
   readmitted [**9-8**] in volume overload and with ARF.. Recent echo showed EF
   <20%, global severe HK, severe TR, and marked biventricular dilation.
   Discharged for 2d to rehab, but signed out AMA to his rooming home,
   where he was unable to care for himself. On admit he was found to be
   volume overloaded, with increased Cr and hypotension. He went to cath
   lab [**9-8**] that showed elevated filling pressure with pulmonary
   hypertension. He was started on milrinone and lasix gtt and admitted to
   CCU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction less than 20%, atrial fibrillation after ablation, and an implanted pacemaker/implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted for recurrent ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in the setting of decompensated heart failure. The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation, marked biventricular dilation, and global severe hypokinesis. He was discharged to rehabilitation but returned AMA (against medical advice) to his rooming home. Upon admission, he was found to be volume overloaded, with increased creatinine and hypotension. He underwent a right heart catheterization that showed elevated filling pressures with pulmonary hypertension. He was started on milrinone and lasix and admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient's presentation with CHF exacerbation likely due to medication non-compliance indicates a potential complication of heart failure worsening.
2. Volume Overload: The patient was found to be volume overloaded upon admission, which could lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, and renal dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine was above 1.0 in the past year, and current values are elevated, indicating possible acute kidney injury"
