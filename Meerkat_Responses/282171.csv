   Assessment and Plan
   81 y.o. Male w/ esophageal and NSCLC initially admitted w/ witnessed
   seizure, hypotension admitted to ICU for hypotension concerning for
   sepsis vs hypovolemia.
   ##. Hypotension: Concerning for sepsis versus hypovolemia. Pt last had
   chemo several days prior to admission and is undergoing XRT. Noted to
   be febrile prior to the episode of hypotension, coupled with positive
   bld culture concerning for septic shock. Pt currently started on
   Cipro/Flagyl/[**Last Name (LF) 339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change coverage to Zosyn, [**First Name3 (LF) 339**], Flagyl for
   broad coverage pending speciation. Will also continue to IVF bolus and
   placed a central line. Suspected sources include GI given episode of
   bleeding this AM, will also check pulmonary, urine. Other ddx to
   consider includes hypovolemia given pt's poor PO intake and admission
   data of hypotension relieved with IVF.  Favor the latter given SIRS
   negative.
   - Make Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1525**] aware of bloodstream infection in patient with
   portacath as he placed portacath
   - f/u bld cultures
 GPC
   - check U/A, urine cultures
   - placed central line for access, possible pressors
 less likely now
   - place A-line if hypotension persists or pressors are initiated
deferred given excellent response to fluids
   - change abx to [**Last Name (STitle) 339**], Zosyn, Flagyl
 Zosyn, Flagyl for bowel, [**Last Name (STitle) 339**] for
   GPCs
   - f/u C. diff, Stool cultures
   - check CXR for PNA
   - check Hct
   .
   ## Abdominal Pain:  See below, not concerned for Toxic megacolon,
   though would check KUB to r/o obstruction as patient was having
   diarrhea, now not moving bowels.
   -KUB
   .
   ##Throat Pain:  Likely [**2-25**] XRT
   -magic mouthwash
   -oxycodone
   .
   ##. Hematochezia: Per review with primary team on medicine floor pt was
   noted to have 400cc of bloody bowel movement. GI have already been
   consulted with the concern being ischaemic colitis given the level of
   hypotension in the ED. GI recommended pt start a clear diet and undergo
   an infectious colitis work up.
   - will check stool cx, C. diff toxin for infectious colitis work up
   - will type and cross
   - check Hct, [**Hospital1 7**] for now given stability
   - f/u GI recs
   - will continue on clear diet
   .
   ##. [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt's baseline Creatinine 1.0-1.2, currently elevated, likely
   pre-renal in nature, need to consider ATN given episode of hypotension.
   Will continue to trend Creatinine response to fluids.If Creatinine
   fails to improve will consider urine lytes.
   - trend Creatinine
   .
   ##. Seizure: Will continue on home regimen of phenobarbital, place on
   seizure precautions
    .
   ##. Esophageal/NSCLC: Pt received chemo several days ago, received XRT
   yesterday AM.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with esophageal and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted to the ICU for hypotension concerning for sepsis or hypovolemia. The patient had a witnessed seizure and was febrile prior to the episode of hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99Â°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 99/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's general appearance is pleasant, and there are no signs of scleral icterus or abnormal eye movements. The cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm with normal rate and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The lung examination reveals clear to bilaterally open air movement. The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, and there are no hepatosplenomegaly or shifting dullness. The extremities show no edema or cyanosis, and the neurologic examination indicates orientation to person, place, and year with grossly intact cranial nerves. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 113 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 124 mg/dL, and sodium of 135 mEq/L. Other lab values include potassium of 3.2 mEq/L, chloride of 28.7%, magnesium of 2.5 mg/dL, calcium of 7.5 mg/dL, and phosphorus of 2.8 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment includes hypotension concerning for sepsis versus hypovolemia, with suspected sources including gastrointestinal bleeding. Other differentials include hypovolemia due to poor oral intake. The patient's blood culture is positive, indicating a potential bloodstream infection. 

The plan includes notifying Dr. [Last Name (STitle)] about the bloodstream infection in the patient with portacath, following up on blood cultures, and checking urine analysis and urine cultures. A central line has been placed for access and possible pressors. Antibiotic coverage has been changed to Cipro/Flagyl and later to Zosyn/Flagyl for broad coverage pending speciation. The patient will continue to receive intravenous fluids and will have a close monitoring of creatinine levels. The patient will also be evaluated for gastrointestinal causes of bleeding and potential infectious colitis. 

Overall, the patient's main medical complications and conditions include hypotension with suspected sepsis or hypovolemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, possible bloodstream infection, and renal dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of esophageal and NSCLC, initially admitted with a witnessed seizure and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU for hypotension, concerning for sepsis versus hypovolemia. The patient recently received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He was febrile prior to the episode of hypotension and had a positive blood culture, suggesting septic shock. He has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is receiving IV fluids. Other potential sources of infection include the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and urinary system. The patient also experienced hematochezia, and further investigation is needed to rule out ischemic colitis. The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, likely due to pre-renal causes, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis. Seizure precautions have been implemented, and the patient's cancer treatment will continue as planned. The patient is on DVT prophylaxis and has multiple lines placed for access. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending resolution of symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his positive blood culture and signs of systemic infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but ongoing monitoring and management of infection sources are necessary.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's elevated creatinine levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of malignancy, currently admitted to the ICU for management of septic shock. The patient presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, low blood pressure, and a central venous pressure of 3. The patient responded well to intravenous fluids and was stabilized. A GI consult was obtained due to suspicion of ischemic colitis, but lactate levels were only elevated at 2.2. The patient had one liquid bowel movement but was unable to send it for analysis.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the development of new-onset atrial fibrillation in the afternoon. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2Â°C (99Â°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/66-78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with esophageal and non-small cell lung cancer who was initially admitted for a witnessed seizure and hypotension. He is now in the ICU for hypotension concerning for sepsis versus hypovolemia. The patient underwent chemotherapy several days prior to admission and is undergoing radiation therapy. He was febrile prior to the episode of hypotension, and his blood culture is concerning for septic shock. The patient has been started on Cipro/Flagyl/Lactobacillus for broad coverage pending speciation. He will also continue to receive intravenous fluids (IVF) bolus and has had a central line placed. Suspected sources of infection include the gastrointestinal tract given the episode of bleeding this morning, as well as the lungs and urine. Other differential diagnoses to consider include hypovolemia given the patient's poor oral intake and admission data of hypotension relieved with IVF. Bacteremia is most likely transient versus contaminant given coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Blood cultures will be followed.

The patient has a history of esophageal and non-small cell lung cancer, for which he received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He has been experiencing abdominal pain, likely due to diarrhea or a diarrheal illness, with some distension on kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) but no air-fluid levels. A KUB will be done, and stool studies will be followed up."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with esophageal and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was initially admitted with a witnessed seizure and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU for hypotension concerning for sepsis versus hypovolemia. The patient recently had chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The patient's recent events include:

1. GI consult thought possibly ischemic colitis, lactate only 2.2, had no more bloody BM (had one liquid BM, unable to send), ab exam stable.
2. Went into new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB w/ RVR) in the afternoon.
3. Had low blood pressures, responded well to intravenous fluids (IVF), central venous pressure (CVP) was 3.
4. Discussed code status with daughter, but the patient refused to talk about it, social worker (SW) case placed.
5. Surveillance blood cultures drawn peripherally and from [Last Name (LF) 9279], [First Name3 (LF)] not remove [First Name3 (LF) 9279] unless more evidence of infection (currently only 1 of 2 sets, 2/2 bottles growing CoNS).
6. Kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) done, no read yet but distended bowel, no air-fluid levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, abdominal pain, and possible ischemic colitis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2Â°C (97.2Â°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 101/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, and mild epigastric pain. The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 81 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a low potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's abdominal pain, particularly in the epigastric region, along with the low blood pressure, suggests a possible complication of ischemic colitis. Ischemic colitis occurs when there is a reduced blood flow to the colon, leading to inflammation and injury of the colon wall. This condition can present with abdominal pain, often localized to the left side, and"
