","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
- He presented to the emergency room with pneumonia and underwent right thoracentesis, resulting in a subcutaneous hematoma and a drop in hematocrit.
- The patient has been diagnosed with anemia due to acute blood loss, likely secondary to the chest wall hematoma and possible blood in the pleural space.
- The patient also has pneumonia, with a history of pseudomonas pneumonia.
- He is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for 14 days.
- The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation and is on lopressor for rate control.
- The patient's code status is DNI (do not intubate), and he will be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia due to acute blood loss: The patient's hematocrit dropped significantly after the thoracentesis, indicating acute blood loss. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. Monitoring the patient's vital signs and oxygen saturation is crucial. Blood products may be necessary if the patient shows signs of hemodynamic instability or symptomatic anemia.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia, which is a common and potentially severe infection. Continuing antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperac"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented to the emergency room with pneumonia and underwent a right thoracentesis, resulting in a subcutaneous hematoma and a drop in hematocrit. The patient is currently in the ICU and is hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anemia due to acute blood loss: The patient's low hematocrit indicates acute blood loss, likely secondary to the thoracentesis in the setting of Coumadin use. To manage this, active T&S and crossmatching of 2 units of blood are recommended. Transfusion should be done for Hct < 21, and the patient should have large bore IVs, with q6 hour hematocrit trending.

2. Hematoma: The patient has an elevated INR and is on Coumadin, which combined with the expansive hematoma observed by OSH hospitalist, suggests a hematoma. It is advised to hold Coumadin, appreciate thoracic surgery recommendations, and be aware of interventional radiology (IR) for possible angio embolization if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.

3. Pneumonia: The patient is febrile with leukocytosis and an infiltrate at OSH. He should continue receiving vancomycin and Zosyn for healthcare-associated pneumonia given his altered level of consciousness (ALF). Follow-up with"

- Anemia is suspected to be caused by acute blood loss from the chest wall hematoma and possible blood in the pleural space.
- The patient's INR is within normal range, and vitamin K has been administered.
- There is a worsening chest X-ray, and further evaluation with CT surgery is needed to determine the best plan for managing the effusion.
- The patient's oxygenation and respiratory rate remain stable.
- The patient has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia.
- Antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and zosyn has been initiated for 14 days.
- The patient's code status is DNI (do not intubate).
- The patient is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia, which can be a difficult infection to treat and may require aggressive antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and possible sepsis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which can lead to poor cardiac output and potential complications such as stroke"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented to the emergency room with pneumonia and subsequently underwent right thoracentesis, resulting in a subcutaneous hematoma. The patient's hematocrit levels dropped, and he developed anemia likely due to acute blood loss. The cause of the anemia is attributed to the chest wall hematoma and possible blood in the pleural space. The patient's condition has been stable, and he is currently being monitored with repeated CXRs and hct trend analysis.

Additionally, the patient has pneumonia, specifically pseudomonas pneumonia. He is receiving vancomycin and zosyn for a duration of 14 days. The patient has do not intubate (DNI) status, and blood and sputum cultures have been sent. A speech and swallow consult has been requested.

Furthermore, the patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation. An echocardiogram revealed moderate aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation, but normal ejection fraction. Lopressor was added at a dose of 12.5mg po bid, and anticoagulation has been withheld due to the recent bleeding episode.

Medical Complications:
1. Anemia due to acute blood loss: The patient's hematocrit levels have dropped, indicating acute blood loss, likely secondary to the chest wall hematoma resulting from thoracentesis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented to the ER with pneumonia and underwent right thoracentesis, resulting in a subcutaneous hematoma and a drop in hematocrit. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but has shown a significant increase in the size of the right hemothorax over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia due to acute blood loss: The patient may develop anemia as a result of the thoracentesis procedure and Coumadin use. Hemodynamic stability is currently observed, but ongoing monitoring and crossmatching of blood units may be necessary.
2. Hematoma/hemothorax: The presence of an expanding hematoma in the setting of Coumadin use is concerning. The patient's condition requires evaluation by thoracic surgery, and a chest tube placement may be considered to manage the hemothorax.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been febrile with leukocytosis and infiltrates at OSH, indicating pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) will be continued for a 14-day course, especially considering the healthcare-associated pneumonia.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation should be deferred due to the risk of bleeding, and met"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented to the hospital with pneumonia and underwent a right thoracentesis, which resulted in a subcutaneous hematoma and a drop in hematocrit. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient also has anemia likely secondary to acute blood loss due to the thoracentesis in the setting of Coumadin use. There are plans to crossmatch 2 units of blood, start trend q12-hour hematocrit, appreciate thoracic surgery recommendations, and consider interventional radiology (IR) for embolization if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. The patient also has a hematoma, for which it is recommended to hold Coumadin, appreciate thoracic surgery recommendations, and consider IR. Additionally, the patient has pneumonia, febrile with leukocytosis and infiltrate, and will continue with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for a 14-day course. The patient also has new-onset atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation will be deferred as the patient is stable. Metoprolol 12.5 mg will be started. The patient is on regular diet, and insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control. The patient has a PICC line placed. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient's code status is DNI (do not intubate), and disposition is transfer to the floor. Total time spent with the patient was 45 minutes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia due to acute blood loss: The patient has a drop in hematocrit, indicating acute blood loss. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and chest pain.
2. Hematoma: The patient has a subcutaneous hematoma resulting from the thoracentesis. This can cause local pain, swelling, and potentially lead to infection or further complications if it expands or compresses surrounding structures.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can lead to symptoms such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and chest pain. If left untreated, it can worsen and potentially lead to respiratory failure or sepsis.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potentially lead to stroke if anticoagulation is not managed properly.
5. Coumadin use: The patient is on Coumadin, which is an anticoagulant medication. The use of Coumadin increases the risk of bleeding, and the patient's hematoma may be related to this medication."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented to the emergency room on 4/28/2190 with pneumonia and underwent right thoracentesis, resulting in a subcutaneous hematoma. The patient's hematocrit level has dropped, but it remains stable. The family prefers conservative management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia due to acute blood loss: The patient has experienced blood loss from the chest wall hematoma and possible blood in the pleural space during thoracentesis. This may lead to anemia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin for 14 days. It is important to continue monitoring for any worsening of respiratory symptoms.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation and an echocardiogram showed moderate aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation with normal ejection fraction. The patient's heart rate needs to be controlled, and anticoagulation should be avoided due to the recent bleed.
4. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, with a large effusion on the right side. This could potentially complicate respiratory function and may require further intervention.
5. Renal issues: There is moderate dilatation of the left renal collecting system, which should be monitored closely."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and underwent right thoracentesis. The patient subsequently developed a subcutaneous hematoma and a drop in hematocrit. He has been diagnosed with anemia due to acute blood loss, likely secondary to chest wall hematoma and possible blood in the pleural space. The patient's hemoglobin is 9.7 g/dL, and he is actively being typed and screened for blood transfusion.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 126/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is currently on metoprolol for atrial fibrillation, which he developed. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and normal kidney function. His blood cultures and sputum cultures are pending.

Plan:
1. Anemia due to acute blood loss:
   - Active type and screen
   - [Hospital1] hct for now
   - IR aware, at this point clinically stable and not necessary for embolization
   - Hold coumadin (indication was new afib), INR 1.4, had rec vit K
   - Worsening CXR today, discuss with CT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented to the hospital with pneumonia and subsequently underwent right thoracentesis, resulting in a subcutaneous hematoma and a drop in hematocrit. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but has an increased size of the effusion on the right side over the past 24 hours.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Anemia due to acute blood loss: The patient may develop anemia as a result of blood loss during the thoracentesis procedure. This can be managed by monitoring the patient's hematocrit levels and considering blood transfusions if necessary.

2. Hematoma/hemothorax: The patient has a subcutaneous hematoma and an increased size of effusion, which indicates the possibility of a hemothorax. This condition can be managed by consulting with thoracic surgery for recommendations, such as the placement of a chest tube to drain the accumulated blood in the chest cavity.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has febrile leukocytosis and infiltrates at OSH, suggesting pneumonia. The current treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for a 14-day course. However, given the patient's healthcare-associated pneumonia and acute liver failure, it is important to follow up with OSH culture data.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He presented to the emergency room with pneumonia and subsequently underwent right thoracentesis, resulting in a subcutaneous hematoma and a drop in hematocrit. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable in the ICU. His medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged except for the mentioned complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia due to acute blood loss: The patient's hematocrit dropped following thoracentesis, likely secondary to Coumadin use. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of blood transfusion may be necessary.
2. Hematoma/hemothorax: The patient has an expanding hematoma despite stable effusion size. Conservative management is being attempted, but further evaluation by thoracic surgery is recommended. The possibility of placing a chest tube should be considered.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is febrile with leukocytosis and an infiltrate at OSH. He will continue receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for a 14-day course. Given his residence in a nursing home, healthcare-associated pneumonia is suspected.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation may not be necessary at this time, but rate control with metoprolol is being optimized.
5. Coumadin use:"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 y.o. M with HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who presented to
   [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] ER on [**2190-4-28**] with pneumonia, now s/p R thoracentesis c/b
   subcutaneous hematoma in setting of hematocrit drop, now
   hemodynamically stable in size on the right and hemodynamically stable.
   > Anemia due to acute lood loss: Likely secondary to thoracentesis in
   setting of coumadin.  Hemodynamically stable at present.
   - follow Hct
   - appreciate thoracic surgery recs
   - hold coumadin
   > Hematoma/hemothorax: Pt with elevated INR in setting of coumadin and
   expansive hematoma now increased in size although the effusion size is
   stable (with clot visible on the . will try to optimize conservative
   management (in the absence of another attempt at thoracentesis / chest
   tube)
   - appreciate thoracic surgery recs, will d/w thoracic surgery  re:
   chest tube
   - hold coumadin
    > Pneumonia: Febrile with leukocytosis and infiltrate at OSH. No clx
   data.
   - Would cont Vanco (D1=[**5-7**])  and Pip-Tazo (D1= [**4-28**]) for 14 day course.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for healthcare associated pneumonia
   given living in nursing home.
   > Atrial fibrillation: New onset per OSH
   - defer anticoagulation
   - as HD stable, uptitrating Metop with good effect.
   Additional issues per ICU resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The patient presented to the emergency room with pneumonia and underwent right thoracentesis, resulting in a subcutaneous hematoma and a subsequent drop in hematocrit. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient has several medical conditions and potential complications that need to be addressed:

1. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia due to acute blood loss, secondary to thoracentesis in the setting of Coumadin use. The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.7 g/dL, which is low. The plan is to follow Hct and hold Coumadin. The patient may require blood transfusion to manage the anemia.

2. Hematoma/Hemothorax: The patient has a hematoma that is increasing in size, despite the stable size of the effusion. The presence of a visible clot on ultrasound suggests that the hematoma may be expanding. The patient's INR is elevated, which further indicates ongoing bleeding risk. The plan is to optimize conservative management and consider a referral to thoracic surgery for possible chest tube placement.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, as evidenced by fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobact"
