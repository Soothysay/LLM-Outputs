   Disposition:
","The patient is a 87-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, malignant hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to flash pulmonary edema, which responded to lasix and CPAP. He required non-invasive ventilation for a period of time. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, mild agitation, and disorientation, but he is responsive to commands and oriented to person, year, and month. His vital signs are stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. He has paradoxical chest expansion, crackles bilaterally on inspiration, and wheezes on expiration. His extremities are warm and well-perfused. His neurological examination is essentially unremarkable. The patient has several laboratory abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. His cardiac enzymes are within normal range, and his renal function tests show some abnormalities. The patient has a history of multiple infections, including urinary tract infection and pneumonia. He also has a history of coronary artery disease and chronic renal failure. The patient's current medications include antibiotics, antihypertensives, antidiabetics, and other ICU medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo F with CLL, HTN, CAD, chronic stable diastolic CHF (EF 55
   %), hyperlipdemia, hypothyroid, CKD (baseline creatinine ), DM2,
   anemia, a-fib, and gout admitted with AMS, renal failure, and [**Hospital 182**]
   transferred to ICU w/ HTN, hypoxia, tachycardia.
   .
   #) SOB/HYPOXIA: Most likely flash pulmonary edema in setting Afib w/
   RVR and hypertensive urgency. Repeat CXR this AM seems to support
   volume overload. No e/o underlying lower tract Oat had occasional O2
   requirement this hospitalization w/ significant SOB [**3-2**] overnight in
   setting of transfusions. Less likely PE (low plt, slowly increasing O2
   requirement). TRALI considered but pt improved quickly with diuresis
   and nebulizer treatments. CXR c/w volume overload. Pt has h/o stridor
   with tracheal compression from nodes. No e/o stridor on exam. EKG
   unchanged from baseline though pt tachycardic. Echo w/ nml EF but some
   e/o LVH and mild diastolic dysfunction.
   - cont CPAP, reassess q1H
   - cont nebs ATC
   - diuresis with goal <1L today
   - cycle CE; low-dose aspirin as pt is thrombocytopenic, no statin
   - nitro paste for now
   - rate control w/ dilt PO 60 QID, IV prn
   .
   #) Atrial Fibrillation: Likely triggered by hypoxia in setting of flash
   edema ([**2-14**] HTN). On rate control as she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation secondary to chronic low platelets.
   Continue carvedilol 50mg [**Hospital1 7**], increase dilt as tolerated.
   .
   #) Hypertension: Patient has history of malignant hypertension in prior
   admissions with symptoms of headache and epigastric/left sided chest
   pain. Patient is now on a fairly extensive med regimin including
   lisinopril, BB, nitrate, clonidine patch,diltiazem.
   - cont all meds , dilt dose increased to 60 QID
   .
   #) AMS. Improving, was likely multifactorial. Patient p/w known UTI and
   recent neutropenia, and was recently started on oxycontin for pain. She
   was also on gabapentin while in acute on chronic renal failure. Review
   of her meds show multiple sedating agents. Head CT was negative.
   Patient now alert and oriented.
   - hold oxycontin, lorazepam, diphenhydramine, gabapentin
   - pan-culture; cultures so far NGTD
   - antibiotics as indicated; currently on bactrim (UTI) and flagyl
   (mouth flora)
   - cont to monitor mental status, white count, fever curve
   .
   #) UTI. Patient was being treated for reported ""pan-sensitive"" E. coli
   with nitrofurantoin. Placed on IV ciprofloxacin for coverage, repeat
   urine culture negative. Stopping ciprofloxacin for now. Pt does have
   h/o ESBL. Per rehab, she did receive imipenem. Bactrim for 10-day
   course given sensitivities.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue ASA, beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor. Cardiac enzymes are
   negative on admisison, recycled [**3-2**]. ECG w/o new ST-T changes, pat w/o
   CP currently.
   - cycle CE x2
   .
   #) fever: sources include pulmonary (CXR negative for consolidation,
   decreased O2 sat in setting of pul edema), urine (has h/o ESBL, u/a not
   impressive at this time), blood (negative cultures to date), previous
   biopsy sites (bilat neck u/w negative for abscess though +fluctuance on
   exam), sacral wound, tooth decay.
   - monitor cultures; urine + for E Coli
   - broaden antibiotic coverage -- pt has lactam allergy; was on
   aztreonam for gram negatives, vanco for gram positives, and clindamycin
   for anaerobes (mouth flora)--> now narrowed to flaygl (stomach upset
   with clinda) for mouth flora and bactrim for UTI
   .
   #) ARF: back to baseline.
   - monitor UOP, Crea
   - dose meds renally
   .
   #) Pancytopenia. Patient has CLL and chronically has low counts. Her
   white count is very low compared to her usual baseline. ? marrow
   infiltration vs. suppression from sepsis vs. medication effect. Recent
   bone marrow [**12-20**] w/o clear explanation to account for pancytopenia.
   Retic count inappropriately low. Smear not very impressive but confirms
   pancytopenia, also some larger RBCs. Pt did receive imipenem at rehab
   and has history of leukopenia w/ beta-lactam antibiotics, which is most
   likely explanation.
   - continue to monitor, trend
   - hold ALL beta-lactam antibiotics
   - neutropenic precautions
   - transfuse if hct < 21, plt <10k or actively bleeding
   - consider bone marrow biopsy in the near future
   .
   #) CLL. Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 183**].
   .
   #) Thrush/dental pain: Continue nystatin swish, peridex.
   - f/u panorex x-ray
   - dental consult appreciated. Pt will need extraction in future when
   medicall stable
   - pain control
   .
   #) Diabetes. QID finger sticks, continue sliding scale, diabetic diet.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism. Continue levothyroxine 75mcg daily.
   .
   #) F/E/N. Cardiac/diabetic diet. Lyte repletion PRN.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic stable diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 55%), hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine), diabetes mellitus type 2, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and gout. She was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), renal failure, and hypertensive urgency. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which was treated with CPAP and diuresis. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation but still shows signs of respiratory distress.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may have been triggered by hypoxia in the setting of flash pulmonary edema. She is on rate control medications but not anticoagulation due to chronic low platelets.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of malignant hypertension and is on multiple antihypertensive medications. Her blood pressure remains elevated despite medication.
4. AMS: The patient presented with altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including UTI, recent neutropenia, and multiple sedating medications. Her mental status has improved after stopping oxycontin and other sed"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo F with CLL, HTN, CAD, chronic stable diastolic CHF (EF 55
   %), hyperlipdemia, hypothyroid, DM2,, and a-fib admitted with AMS,
   renal failure, and [**Hospital 182**] transferred to ICU w/HTN, hypoxia, tachycardia,
   found to have flash pulmonary edema.
   .
   #) FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA - in setting of Afib w/ RVR and hypertensive
   urgency that may have placed an excessive strain on her LV, causing
   transient decreased compliance and pulmonary overload. Repeat CXR
   confirms massive volume overload.
   -          aggressive diuresis today with goal
 1 to 1.5 liters
   -          liberal use of CPAP as needed
   -          continue nitroglycerin paste
   -          d/c Albuterol and salmeterol as may be contributing to
   tachycardia which in turn worsens LV function
   -          avoid morphine as possible rash hypersensitivity
   -          repeat echocardiogram to reassess LVEF, as progression of
   CAD and CHF may render her more susceptible to ischemia, thus
   precipitating acute flashes of pulmonary edema
   -          ? temporal relation to aztreonam dosing. Will monitor.
   #) Atrial Fibrillation: she is not a candidate for anticoagulation
   secondary to chronic thrombocytopenia.
   -          maxed out on carvedilol
   -          maxed out on po diltiazem
   -          would add esmolol for rate control  if HR >90
   -          avoid digoxin given CRI
   #) Diastolic CHF
   -          already on failure regimen of ACE-I, carvedilol, and lasix
   -          consult Heart Failure service today for assistance in
   management
   -          optimize afterload reduction, goal SBP <130
   #) Hypertension: Patient has history of malignant hypertension in prior
   admissions with symptoms of headache and epigastric/left sided chest
   pain
   -          continue current regimen of lisinopril, BB, nitrate,
   clonidine, and diltiazem.
   -          she should have a workup for secondary causes of
   hyptertension in the future
   .
   #) AMS
 A+O x3 this AM but was altered last night in setting of
   pulmonary edema. Had similar episode during previous night.
   -          Patient p/w known UTI, infection could contribute to AMS
   -          pan-cultured; cultures so far NGTD
   -          continue current ABx as detailed below
   -          Head CT was negative.
   -          hold all sedating meds including oxycontin, diphenhydramine,
   gabapentin
   -          AVOID lorazepam
   -          Use haldol prn, monitor QTc
   #) FEVER AND UTI
 pt had UTI with 2 morphologies of E. coli, put on
   bactrim although one colony is resistant to this [**Doctor Last Name **].
   -          Despite this, most recent urine culture negative
   -          coverage broadened yesterday in setting of acute
   decompensation, now on vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP coverage
   -          would d/c above 3 antibiotics if no culture growth after
   tomorrow
   -          should remain on flagyl for dental abscess, anaerobe
   coverage
   -          Bactrim was started [**2-27**], would d/c [**3-9**]
   -          f/u all cultures
   #) CAD:
   - medical management with ASA, beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor, CCB,
   nitrate
   - ECG w/o new ST-T changes, CK
s flat
   #) CRI.
   - monitor UOP, Crea
   - dose meds renally
   .
   #) Pancytopenia. Patient has CLL and chronically has low counts. Recent
   bone marrow [**12-20**] w/o clear explanation to account for pancytopenia.
   Per Onc, suspect CLL-assosciated ITP. Also, known history of leukopenia
   w/ beta-lactam antibiotics
   - continue to trend counts
   - hold ALL beta-lactam antibiotics
   - transfuse if hct < 21 ([**Male First Name (un) 194**] any units of blood with lasix), plt <10k
   or actively bleeding
   .
   #) CLL.
   -          Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 183**]
   #) Thrush/dental pain:
   -          Continue nystatin swish
   #) Diabetes.
   -          QID finger sticks, continue sliding scale, diabetic diet
   #) Hypothyroidism.
   -          Continue levothyroxine 75mcg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic stable diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 55%, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), renal failure, and later found to have flash pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient experienced flash pulmonary edema in the setting of AFib with right ventricular overload and hypertensive urgency. This could have placed excessive strain on her left ventricle, causing transient decreased compliance and pulmonary overload. The patient received aggressive diuresis and CPAP as needed for management.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic AFib and is not a candidate for anticoagulation secondary to chronic thrombocytopenia. Rate control measures such as carvedilol, diltiazem, and esmolol will be considered if the heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute.
3. Diastolic CHF: The patient has a history of chronic stable diastolic CHF. Management includes optimization of afterload reduction and goal systolic blood pressure below 130 mmHg. Consultation with the Heart"

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old woman with acute, intermittent respiratory distress with
   diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.  Clinically, this appears to be acute
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema although she is at risk for pulmonary
   infections including atypical pathogens.
 RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
   As above, this is most likely to be acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema,
   although we need to consider other etiologies.  Today, we will
   1) repeat echocardiogram to ensure no major changes in LVEF or
   pericardial disease
   2) rate control Atrial fibrillation today --> now in in sinus.  If she
   needs additional rate control today, would try esmolol
   3) Stop inhaled adrenergics
   4) consult heart failure service today
   5) although infection seems an unlikely etiology at present, we will
   continue current ABX (vanco, aztreonam, flagyl (?dental issue)) for
   possible nosocomial infection.  We will observe closely to see if there
   is a temporal relationship between aztreonam dosing and episodes of
   acute respiratory distress, since anaphylaxis may present like this.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with acute intermittent respiratory distress and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. The most likely diagnosis is acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, although other etiologies need to be considered. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, pancytopenia, and CLL.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema or infection.
2. Hypotension and shock due to cardiogenic or septic causes.
3. Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, which the patient already has.
4. Worsening renal function due to hypotension, sepsis, or acute kidney injury.
5. Further thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications.
6. Poor glycemic control in the setting of diabetes mellitus.
7. Coronary artery disease progression leading to myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation, fluid balance, and laboratory values. Treatment should focus on managing the underlying causes, such as heart failure, infection, and optimizing cardiovascular and renal function. Regular communication and interdisciplinary rounds are necessary to ensure comprehensive care for the patient."

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) and
   regional function is normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
   Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
   (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-23**], findings
   are similar except patient now in sinur rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Pulmonary Edema
   Occurred in setting of afib with RVR. Echo with diastolic dysfunction,
   therefore will not tolerate tachycardia well. Currently in SR with
   improved rate control. Think hypersensitivity reaction to aztreonam is
   less likely given clinical improvement despite continuing aztreonam.
   Still with pulmonary edema on exam.
   --Continue diuresis goal 1-2L negative
   --D/C nitropaste today
   2. Atrial fibrillation
   Unable to anticoagulate secondary to chronic thrombocytopenia.
   Currently in SR with HR in 70
s. CHF service recommendations
   appreciated.
   --Continue diltiazem and carvedilol
   --Start amiodarone if returns to afib
   3. CHF, diastolic, chronic
   --Continue carvelilol, lisinopri, statin. Continue diuresis as above.
   4. HTN
   Patient has h/o malignant hypertension
   --Continue lisinopril, carvedilol, clonidine, and diltiazem. Increase
   lisinopril to 40 today.
   --Consider outpatient workup for secondary causees of hypertension such
   as renal artery stenosis
   5. Altered mental status
   Clear today. Likely multifactorial with hypoxia, infection,
   ?hypertension. Has had negative head CT. Follow, avoid sedating
   medications.
   6. Fever and urinary tract infection
   Currently afebrile without leukocytosis. Patient with known dental
   abscess for which she is being treated with flagy (had GI upset with
   clindamycin). CXR c/w edema no focal infiltrate strongly suggestive of
   pna
   --Will treat with nitrofurantoin x14 day course given foley
   --Discontinue vancomycin, aztreonam, cipro in absence of other
   infectious source
   --Continue flagyl for now
   7. CAD
   Continue ASA, beta blocker, statin, nitrates. No evidence of active
   ischemia, cardiac enzymes flat.
   8. Pancytopenia
   Patient has CLL and chronically has low counts. Recent bone marrow
   [**12-20**] w/o clear explanation to account for pancytopenia. Per Onc,
   suspect CLL-assosciated ITP. Also, known history of leukopenia w/
   beta-lactam antibiotics
   --Follow ANC
   -- transfuse if hct < 21 ([**Male First Name (un) 194**] any units of blood with lasix), plt
   <10k or actively bleeding
   9. CLL.
   -- Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 183**]
   10. Thrush/dental pain:
   -- Continue nystatin swish
   11. Diabetes.
   --QID finger sticks, continue sliding scale, diabetic diet
   12. Hypothyroidism.
   - -Continue levothyroxine 75mcg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath and tachycardia. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, AFib, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, altered mental status, fever, urinary tract infection, coronary artery disease, pancytopenia, and CLL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's current symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles in the bilateral lung fields indicate ongoing pulmonary edema. Continued diuresis and monitoring for fluid balance are necessary.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AFib and is currently in sinus rhythm with improved rate control. However, there is a concern for recurrent AFib, especially with the presence of diastolic dysfunction. Close monitoring and consideration for anticoagulation if the patient returns to AFib.
3. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of moderate diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography. Management should focus on controlling blood pressure, reducing fluid overload, and optimizing medications for heart failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of malignant hypertension. Blood pressure control is essential to prevent further end-organ damage. Adjustments in antihypertensive medications may be needed.
5. Altered Mental Status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and multiple comorbidities, including congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal failure (CRF), and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath (SOB) and tachycardia. Diuretics were administered, and red blood cells (RBCs) were transfused. ASA was stopped, and a statin was started. The patient's heart rate has been in the 70s throughout the day, and an echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 55% with moderate diastolic dysfunction. The patient's platelet count is dropping, but there is no evidence of bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis/hypertensive emergency: The patient has a history of hypertension and currently has blood pressure readings ranging from 136/59 mmHg to 140/67 mmHg.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is low, and there is also a decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt).
3. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and the serum creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which can lead to ischemic heart disease.
5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib, which increases the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications.
6. Pulmonary edema: Crackles are noted on the respiratory examination, indicating possible fluid accumulation in the lungs.
7. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemia: Blood glucose levels are elevated.
8. Urinary tract infection (UTI): There is a concern for UTI based on the provided lab values.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which can affect multiple organ systems.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures are in place, but the patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information. Additional assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) and
   regional function is normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
   Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
   (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free

   There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-23**], findings
   are similar except patient now in sinur rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   #) FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA - in setting of Afib w/ RVR and hypertensive
   urgency that may have placed an excessive strain on her LV, causing
   transient decreased compliance and pulmonary overload. Repeat CXR
   confirms massive volume overload.
   -          aggressive diuresis today with goal
 1 to 1.5 liters
   -          liberal use of CPAP as needed
   -          continue nitroglycerin paste
   -          d/c Albuterol and salmeterol as may be contributing to
   tachycardia which in turn worsens LV function
   -          avoid morphine as possible rash hypersensitivity
   -          repeat echocardiogram to reassess LVEF, as progression of
   CAD and CHF may render her more susceptible to ischemia, thus
   precipitating acute flashes of pulmonary edema
   -          ? temporal relation to aztreonam dosing. Will monitor.
   #) Atrial Fibrillation: she is not a candidate for anticoagulation
   secondary to chronic thrombocytopenia.
   -          maxed out on carvedilol
   -          maxed out on po diltiazem
   -          would add esmolol for rate control  if HR >90
   -          avoid digoxin given CRI
   #) Diastolic CHF
   -          already on failure regimen of ACE-I, carvedilol, and lasix
   -          consult Heart Failure service today for assistance in
   management
   -          optimize afterload reduction, goal SBP <130
   #) Hypertension: Patient has history of malignant hypertension in prior
   admissions with symptoms of headache and epigastric/left sided chest
   pain
   -          continue current regimen of lisinopril, BB, nitrate,
   clonidine, and diltiazem.
   -          she should have a workup for secondary causes of
   hyptertension in the future
   #) AMS
 A+O x3 this AM but was altered last night in setting of
   pulmonary edema. Had similar episode during previous night.
   -          Patient p/w known UTI, infection could contribute to AMS
   -          pan-cultured; cultures so far NGTD
   -          continue current ABx as detailed below
   -          Head CT was negative.
   -          hold all sedating meds including oxycontin, diphenhydramine,
   gabapentin
   -          AVOID lorazepam
   -          Use haldol prn, monitor QTc
   #) FEVER AND UTI
 pt had UTI with 2 morphologies of E. coli, put on
   bactrim although one colony is resistant to this [**Doctor Last Name **].
   -          Despite this, most recent urine culture negative
   -          coverage broadened yesterday in setting of acute
   decompensation, now on vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP coverage
   -          would d/c above 3 antibiotics if no culture growth after
   tomorrow
   -          should remain on flagyl for dental abscess, anaerobe
   coverage
   -          Bactrim was started [**2-27**], would d/c [**3-9**]
   -          f/u all cultures
   #) CAD:
   - medical management with ASA, beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor, CCB,
   nitrate
   - ECG w/o new ST-T changes, CK
s flat
   #) CRI.
   - monitor UOP, Crea
   - dose meds renally
   #) Pancytopenia. Patient has CLL and chronically has low counts. Recent
   bone marrow [**12-20**] w/o clear explanation to account for pancytopenia.
   Per Onc, suspect CLL-assosciated ITP. Also, known history of leukopenia
   w/ beta-lactam antibiotics
   - continue to trend counts
   - hold ALL beta-lactam antibiotics
   - transfuse if hct < 21 ([**Male First Name (un) 194**] any units of blood with lasix), plt <10k
   or actively bleeding
   #) CLL.
   -          Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 183**]
   #) Thrush/dental pain:
   -          Continue nystatin swish
   #) Diabetes.
   -          QID finger sticks, continue sliding scale, diabetic diet
   #) Hypothyroidism.
   -          Continue levothyroxine 75mcg daily.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) and
   regional function is normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
   Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
   (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Pulmonary Edema
   Occurred in setting of afib with RVR. Echo with diastolic dysfunction,
   therefore will not tolerate tachycardia well. Currently in SR with
   improved rate control. Think hypersensitivity reaction to aztreonam is
   less likely given clinical improvement despite continuing aztreonam.
   Still with pulmonary edema on exam.
   --Continue diuresis goal 1-2L negative
   --Continue nitropaste
   2. Atrial fibrillation
   Unable to anticoagulate secondary to chronic thrombocytopenia.
   Currently in SR with HR in 70
s. CHF service recommendations
   appreciated.
   --Continue diltiazem and carvedilol
   --Start amiodarone if returns to afib
   3. CHF, diastolic, chronic
   --Continue carvelilol, lisinopri, statin. Continue diuresis as above.
   4. HTN
   Patient has h/o malignant hypertension
   --Continue lisinopril, carvedilol, clonidine, and diltiazem
   --Consider outpatient workup for secondary causees of hypertension such
   as renal artery stenosis
   5. Altered mental status
   Clear today. Likely multifactorial with hypoxia, infection,
   ?hypertension. Has had negative head CT. Follow, avoid sedating
   medications.
   6. Fever and urinary tract infection
   Currently afebrile without leukocytosis. Patient with known dental
   abscess for which she is being treated with flagy (had GI upset with
   clindamycin). CXR c/w edema no focal infiltrate strongly suggestive of
   pna. No sputum sample yet obtained. On vancomycin, aztreonam, cipro.
   --Does have GNRs from urine, concern that she has failed treatment for
   her highly-resistant ESBl E.coli UTI as only 1 of 2 isolates was
   bactrim sensitive. Would therefore discontinue bactrim.
   7. CAD
   Continue ASA, beta blocker, statin, nitrates. No evidence of active
   ischemia, cardiac enzymes flat.
   8. Pancytopenia
   Patient has CLL and chronically has low counts. Recent bone marrow
   [**12-20**] w/o clear explanation to account for pancytopenia. Per Onc,
   suspect CLL-assosciated ITP. Also, known history of leukopenia w/

   - hold ALL beta-lactam antibiotics
   - transfuse if hct < 21 ([**Male First Name (un) 194**] any units of blood with lasix), plt <10k
   or actively bleeding
   #) CLL.
   -          Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 183**]
   #) Thrush/dental pain:
   -          Continue nystatin swish
   #) Diabetes.
   -          QID finger sticks, continue sliding scale, diabetic diet
   #) Hypothyroidism.
   -          Continue levothyroxine 75mcg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and hypertension (HTN) who was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath and tachycardia. The patient has been experiencing pulmonary edema, altered mental status, fever, urinary tract infection, coronary artery disease (CAD), and pancytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 70s and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and has improved rate control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles on lung examination suggest pulmonary edema. This condition can be exacerbated by tachycardia and diastolic dysfunction, which the patient has. Continued diuresis and rate control are important to manage this condition.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of AFib increases the risk of complications such as stroke and heart failure. Despite being in sinus rhythm, the patient may return to AFib, which would require anticoagulation. However, due to chronic thrombocytopenia, anticoagulation is currently not possible.
3. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's echocardiogram shows moderate diastolic dysfunction and mild left ventricular hypertrophy. This suggests chronic diastolic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. She presented with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. She has multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, pancytopenia secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 120/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is currently receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient has received various treatments, including diuretics, rate control medication for atrial fibrillation, and subcutaneous insulin for diabetes. She also has a PICC line in place for medication administration.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, with slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels. Her liver enzymes are also within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure puts her at risk for worsening cardiac function and fluid overload. Close monitoring of her fluid balance and hemodynamics is essential.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, pancytopenia secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure. She is currently in the ICU for acute diastolic CHF and respiratory distress. The patient has been improving with better rate control of her atrial fibrillation and treatment for heart failure. Her vital signs are stable, and she is on various medications for her conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure puts her at risk for worsening heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory complications: Given her respiratory distress, the patient is at risk for developing further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may increase the risk of hypotension and reduced organ perfusion.
4. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection and is at risk for developing other infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient has chronic renal failure, and her renal function should be closely monitored to avoid further deterioration.
6. Bleeding: The patient has throm"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is in the ICU with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, malignant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, and acute on chronic heart failure.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/50 to 144/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen.
- The patient has been weaned off supplemental oxygen and remains in sinus rhythm.
- A lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENIs) was performed due to concern for right upper extremity > left upper extremity, but no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was found.
- Urine culture grew out E. coli again, so the patient was started on nitrofurantoin per sensitivities.
- The patient has allergies to morphine, beta-lactams, iodine, and hives.
- The patient received various medications including vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole.
- The patient's flow sheet data shows a temperature of 37.1°C, weight of 87.7 kg (admission weight: 88.2 kg), and fluid balance with an input of 1,720 mL and output of 3,790 mL.
- The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with an oxygen saturation of 95% and ABG results of /_31.
- Physical examination findings include no acute distress, symmetric breath sounds with crackles anteriorly and at the bases, decreased wheezing, trace edema in both extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.
- Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 14 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, sodium of 120 mg/dL, potassium of 1.3 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL.
- Imaging studies include a chest X-ray (CXR) showing predominantly perihilar consolidation in both lungs with a smaller region of abnormality at the right base laterally, and an echocardiogram indicating normal left ventricular systolic function but increased left ventricular filling pressure and moderate diastolic dysfunction.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, malignant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection, pancytopenia, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, and acute on chronic heart failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Pneumonia
- Acute kidney injury (AKI)
- Worsening heart failure
- Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
- Infection from indwelling lines or catheters
- Further deterioration of renal function
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer prophylaxis"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Pulmonary Edema
   Occurred in setting of afib with RVR. Echo with diastolic dysfunction,
   therefore will not tolerate tachycardia well. Currently in SR with
   improved rate control. Still with pulmonary edema on exam.
   --Continue diuresis goal 1-2L negative
   2. Atrial fibrillation
   Unable to anticoagulate secondary to chronic thrombocytopenia.
   Currently in SR with HR in 70
s. CHF service recommendations
   appreciated.
   --Continue diltiazem and carvedilol
   --Start amiodarone if returns to afib
   3. CHF, diastolic, chronic
   --Continue carvelilol, lisinopri, statin. Continue diuresis as above.
   4. HTN
   Patient has h/o malignant hypertension
   --Continue lisinopril, carvedilol, clonidine, and diltiazem. Increase
   lisinopril to 40 today.
   --Consider outpatient workup for secondary causees of hypertension such
   as renal artery stenosis
   5. Altered mental status
   Clear today. Likely multifactorial with hypoxia, infection,
   ?hypertension. Has had negative head CT. Follow, avoid sedating
   medications.
   6. Fever and urinary tract infection
   Currently afebrile without leukocytosis. Patient with known dental
   abscess for which she is being treated with flagy (had GI upset with
   clindamycin). CXR c/w edema no focal infiltrate strongly suggestive of
   pna
   --Will treat with nitrofurantoin x14 day course given foley
   --Discontinue vancomycin, aztreonam, cipro in absence of other
   infectious source
   --Continue flagyl for now
   7. CAD
   Continue ASA, beta blocker, statin, nitrates. No evidence of active
   ischemia, cardiac enzymes flat.
   8. Pancytopenia
   Patient has CLL and chronically has low counts. Recent bone marrow
   [**12-20**] w/o clear explanation to account for pancytopenia. Per Onc,
   suspect CLL-assosciated ITP. Also, known history of leukopenia w/
   beta-lactam antibiotics
   --Follow ANC
   -- transfuse if hct < 21 ([**Male First Name (un) 194**] any units of blood with lasix), plt
   <10k or actively bleeding
   9. CLL.
   -- Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 183**]
   10. Thrush/dental pain:
   -- Continue nystatin swish
   11. Diabetes.
   --QID finger sticks, continue sliding scale, diabetic diet

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, coronary artery disease, pancytopenia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diabetes, hypothyroidism, and allergies to morphine, beta-lactams, iodine, and hives.

24-hour events include remaining in sinus rhythm with good rate control, weaning down on supplemental oxygen, performance of lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) due to concern for right upper extremity (RUE) > left upper extremity (LUE), no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and growth of E. coli in urine. The patient was started on nitrofurantoin per sensitivities. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole.

Vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/50 to 144/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently not experiencing acute distress.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the anterior chest and bases, decreased wheezing, warm skin, and normal neurological findings."

   1. Pulmonary Edema
   Occurred in setting of afib with RVR. Echo with diastolic dysfunction,
   therefore will not tolerate tachycardia well. Currently in SR with
   improved rate control. Still with pulmonary edema on exam.
   --Continue diuresis goal 1-2L negative
   2. Atrial fibrillation
   Unable to anticoagulate secondary to chronic thrombocytopenia.
   Currently in SR with HR in 70
s. CHF service recommendations
   appreciated.
   --Continue diltiazem and carvedilol
   --Start amiodarone if returns to afib
   3. CHF, diastolic, chronic
   --Continue carvelilol, lisinopri, statin. Continue diuresis as above.
   4. HTN
   Patient has h/o malignant hypertension
   --Continue lisinopril, carvedilol, clonidine, and diltiazem. Increase
   lisinopril to 40 today.
   --Consider outpatient workup for secondary causees of hypertension such
   as renal artery stenosis
   5. Altered mental status
   Clear today. Likely multifactorial with hypoxia, infection,
   ?hypertension. Has had negative head CT. Follow, avoid sedating
   medications.
   6. Fever and urinary tract infection
   Currently afebrile without leukocytosis. Patient with known dental
   abscess for which she is being treated with flagy (had GI upset with
   clindamycin). CXR c/w edema no focal infiltrate strongly suggestive of
   pna
   --Will treat with nitrofurantoin x14 day course given foley
   --Discontinue vancomycin, aztreonam, cipro in absence of other
   infectious source
   --Continue flagyl for now
   7. CAD
   Continue ASA, beta blocker, statin, nitrates. No evidence of active
   ischemia, cardiac enzymes flat.
   8. Pancytopenia
   Patient has CLL and chronically has low counts. Recent bone marrow
   [**12-20**] w/o clear explanation to account for pancytopenia. Per Onc,
   suspect CLL-assosciated ITP. Also, known history of leukopenia w/
   beta-lactam antibiotics

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old overweight/obese male with a history of chronic hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patient was admitted to the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and acute decompensated heart failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/50 to 144/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and has improved rate control.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (14 K/uL), hemoglobin (8.1 g/dL), blood glucose (163 mg/dL), creatinine (1.5 mg/dL), and potassium (4.8 mEq/L). The patient's chest X-ray reveals predominantly perihilar consolidation in both lungs with a smaller region of abnormality at the right base laterally, which has worsened since the previous day. The echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular systolic function but increased left ventricular filling pressure and moderate diastolic dysfunction.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing diuretics for pulmonary edema, beta-blockers for rate control and CHF, angiotensin-con"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic renal failure (CRF). She is currently in the ICU for worsening atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled blood pressure and heart rate. She is on several medications, including antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as indicated by crackles in the lung bases and diminished breath sounds.
