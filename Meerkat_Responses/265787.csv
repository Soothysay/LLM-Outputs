   =============================
   Patient with rhabdomyolysis probably from pressure necrosis due to
   lying on floor. Patient has acute renal failure, which may reflect ATN
   or rhabdo toxicity to kidney. Need to transduce the CVP to assess
   intravascular volume status. Cool extremities argue for high SVR and
   against a septic picture; this may be related in part to intravascular
   volume status being down - patient has diminished pulses during
   inspiration on ventilator. Will reduce PEEP to help hemodynamics. Check
   echo re: underlying cardiac function.
   Patient has acceptable oxygenation but requiring moderate to high FIO2.
   CXR suggests possible Left mid zone infiltrate. Start on antibiotics
   for possible aspiration; may have aspirated. Low flow state may also be
   contributing to hypoxemia. Reduce PEEP as above. Try to reduce FIO2 to
   0.5 later today if hemodynamics improve. No significant secretions from
   ETT at this time.
   Patient had evidence of GI bleed yesterday. On PPI. GI to consult re:
   endoscopy.  Patient had modest coagulopathy. Will give vitamin K.
   Follow hct - not at transfusion threshold at last check.
   Patient is anuric. Will need to watch potassium closely. Checking
   volume status as above. Will need renal consult for possible urgent
   dialysis.

   Total time spent:
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include acute respiratory failure, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 0.6 and PEEP of 8. They have minimal urine output, suggesting possible acute kidney injury or rhabdomyolysis-induced kidney damage.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 97/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide any history. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels at 161 mg/dL, decreased total CO2 levels at 27 mmol/L, and normal lactic acid levels at 1.5 mmol/L. Imaging reveals haziness in the left mid zone on chest X-ray, suggesting possible lung infiltrates.

The assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, anemia, coagulopathy, and potential pressure necrosis leading to rhabdomyolysis. The medical team is concerned about the patient's intravascular volume status, low flow state contributing to hypoxemia, potential aspiration, and need for urgent dialysis.

The ICU care plan involves nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin,"

   Access: RIJ
   Code:  Full, presumed
   Communication: Patient
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and peptic ulcer disease who presented to the emergency department after falling at home. He was found unresponsive and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury (ARF), hypotension, possible aspiration pneumonia, and elevated liver function tests. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and aggressive management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of stridor and low oxygen saturation indicates respiratory failure. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The need for aggressive respiratory support suggests ongoing respiratory compromise.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and history of prolonged immobility after the fall suggest rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine levels, and muddy casts on urinalysis suggest acute kidney injury. This may be due to rhabdomyolysis or hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of renal function and aggressive fluid resuscitation are necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient requires vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure. Hypotension could be due to volume depletion, sepsis, or cardiac dysfunction.

   Chief Complaint: s/p fall
   24 Hour Events:
   - GI consulted for coffee-ground OG tube material: continue ppi gtt,
   follow Hct closely, they will be on standby.
   - renal consult: + muddy brown casts in sediment.  Agree with
   aggressive rehydration with bicarb, but if calcium drops would change
   to normal saline for hydration.  Would not correct hypocalcemia
   currently as pt at risk for hypercalcemia during recovery phase causing
   muscle deposition of calcium.
   - started flagyl to cover for potential aspiration while pt was down
   - gentle insulin ss
   - consider echo tomorrow
   - calcium stable, creatinine rising, CK falling, still essentially
   anuric.
   - renal attending says to consider stopping fluid if patient remains
   anuric and respiratory status continues to worsen.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and peptic ulcer disease who was found down at home with rhabdomyolysis. He is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, likely caused by severe pulmonary edema. The patient also has hypotension requiring pressors, elevated creatinine levels, and anuria. He has a history of falls and may have sustained an injury to his head or spine. The patient has multiple medical complications including possible gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, bandemia, and skin blisters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and he requires mechanical ventilation. The underlying cause is severe pulmonary edema, which needs to be managed promptly to improve oxygenation.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) indicating muscle breakdown, which can lead to kidney damage if not treated appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient is requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure, suggesting possible volume depletion or sepsis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's anuria and rising creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and careful electrolyte management are necessary.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of coffee-ground emesis and history of peptic ulcer disease raise concern for upper"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male who was found unconscious and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications, including acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/57 mmHg to 74/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), lactate, and liver enzymes. The electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.

The patient's physical examination reveals right facial bruising, right surgical pupil, bilateral lower extremity edema, and unresponsive neurologic status.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Respiratory failure: The goal is to increase PEEP and decrease FiO2.

   resuscitation. Some consolidation is present at the left lung base that
   could
   be due to pneumonia. No pneumothorax. ET tube and right internal
   jugular
   line in standard placements. Nasogastric tube is looped probably in a
   hiatus
   hernia or distended distal esophagus.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: intubated after development of stridor. PO2
   marginally on FIO2 50%.  Could be unable to wean d/t pulm edema from
   worsening fluids, component of emphysema, possible PNA (difficult to
   see LLL), poor perfusion to lung, or large hiatal hernia in chest.
   - wean FiO2 to 40% today or PEEP to [**7-1**] depending on what tolerates.
   - would give fluid bolus for MAP <65.  Also, would start vasopressin
   rather than go up on levophed if needed.
   - ceftriaxone, azithro and flagyl (started [**2111-11-23**]; now day 2) for
   possible aspiration pneumonia
   - CTA today for possible PE.  Was found down.
   - re pan-culture including mini-BAL because could not get sputum
   sample.

","The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is rhabdomyolysis after a fall. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 50% due to respiratory failure. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring pressors such as norepinephrine and vasopressin. The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI) with muddy casts and likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to rhabdomyolysis and potential pre-renal component due to hypoperfusion. The patient has elevated liver enzymes, possibly indicating rhabdomyolysis or other liver dysfunction. The patient also has a coagulopathy with elevated PT and PTT, likely due to liver dysfunction and possible malnutrition. Additionally, the patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and coffee ground emesis, raising concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if unable to wean off mechanical ventilation, further deterioration of renal function leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), progression of liver dysfunction resulting in hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization, and worsening of"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 set at 50%. This indicates a severe respiratory condition that requires support. The patient's ability to wean off the ventilator may be compromised due to factors such as pulmonary edema, component of emphysema, possible pneumonia, poor lung perfusion, or a large hiatus hernia in the chest.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient experienced a fall on 1-26 and had a high CK level at OSH, which is now downtrending. The elevated creatinine and decreasing urine output suggest ongoing kidney damage due to rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring the CK levels, correcting electrolyte imbalances, and following renal recommendations are essential.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has muddy casts and likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to rhabdomyolysis and possibly a pre-renal component due to hypoperfusion. The patient is oliguric with increasing creatinine and BUN levels. Intravenous fluids should be continued, and the need for dialysis should be closely monitored.

4. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. The possible causes include extreme volume depletion, sepsis with bandemia and elevated lactate, or a cardiac etiology. An"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man who was found down with septic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. He responded to fluid boluses and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, pain management, and prophylactic measures. His vital signs and lab results indicate ongoing respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and other complications. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure despite improvements in FiO2. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation and oxygenation are crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's low central venous pressure (CVP) suggests third spacing of fluid due to septic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and fluid balance is essential to maintain adequate perfusion and prevent organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's poor urine output indicates ongoing acute renal failure, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Frequent assessment of renal function and appropriate management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of edema and the patient's immobilization increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning, skin assessment, and proper nursing"
