   CIWA scale for treatment of withdrawal in progress in the emergency
   department.
   .
   FLANK PAIN
   Presents with bilateral flank pain. No clear renal or GU pathology that
   easily explains this. CT abdomen/pelvis is negative by wet read for
   renal or abdominal pathology. Patient states this pain is usually
   resolved with fluids. Not clear why this is, but will give fluids.
   - ?renal ultrasound
   - fluids
   .
   ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL
   High requirements in the ED. Continuing CIWA scale. Needing close
   monitoring at this point given frequency of return of symptoms;
   however, hopefully should be able to complete latter part of withdrawal
   management on the floor.
   - continue CIWA q1/2 hr, valium for CIWA >10
   - zofran for nausea
   - holding home Concerta in setting of tachycardia, hypertension
   - continue low-dose home amlodipine
   - restart venlafaxine given interaction of EtOH w depression in this
   pt; likely having some venlafaxine w/d symptoms unrelated to EtOH w/d
   as well
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS
   ALT=AST, not suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis.
   - review for past hepatitis serologies in [**Hospital1 1670**] records via Logician
   - if not available, Hep B+C serologies
   - consider RUQ u/s for outpt f/u, not an ICU need
   - trend labs
   - continue effexor at home dose given that he has been stable on this,
   may need dose reduction if liver impairment increases
   .
   DEPRESSION
   On venlafaxine at home, has not been taking. Restart, as above.
   .
   ADHD
   On Concerta. Would hold in setting of acute alcohol withdrawal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient required high doses of valium for diaphoresis, agitation, and CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) score >10. The patient appeared anxious throughout the day but responded well to reassurance. No known drug allergies were reported. Diazepam (Valium) was initiated on 2109-07-27 at 04:15 AM.

Vital signs as of 2109-07-27 06:27 AM show a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 81 bpm (normal range 81-104 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 161/111 mmHg to 133/84 mmHg (normal range 101/65-130/85 mmHg), respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (normal range 12-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,877 mL since 12 AM, with outputs including 1,550 mL of urine, 1,400 mL of total out (likely including drainage or other losses), and a fluid balance of 2,327 mL positive.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g"

   20mg q1h PO per CIWA. Will consult addiction services and will continue
   IVF until tolerating PO diet. Given lactate elevation on admission will
   give aggressive IV thiamine repletion, pan-culture, and continue
   hydration until taking better POs. Per report, flank pain has occurred
   on prior occasions when he had EtOH w/d
 monitor, no clear sign of
   infection or structural disease. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male admitted to the ICU for ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal and delirium. The patient has been receiving diazepam infusions and will transition to oral valium 10-20mg every 2 hours based on Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (CIWA) assessment. The patient is also receiving IV fluids, IV thiamine repletion, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Lactate levels are decreasing, and the patient's vital signs are stable. The patient's review of systems and flow sheet data are unchanged from admission except for the noted improvements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient experienced a bout of ventricular tachycardia (Vtach) that was successfully treated with potassium and magnesium repletion. Seizures can still occur due to ongoing ETOH withdrawal, so continuous monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
2. Delirium: The patient is still experiencing delirium, as indicated by the alert and conversant but slightly tremulous mental status. Close monitoring for changes in mental status and continued use of benzodiazepines as needed are recommended.
3. Infection: The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.
4. Fluid balance: The patient has had significant fluid input and output over the past 24 hours. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a past history of alcohol abuse, who
   presents with flank pain and intoxication, with high requirements by
   CIWA scale for treatment of withdrawal in progress in the emergency
   department.
   .
   ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL: High requirements in the ED and overnight.
   Continuing CIWA scale. Needing close monitoring at this point given
   frequency of return of symptoms; however, hopefully should be able to
   complete latter part of withdrawal management on the floor.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse.
- He presented with flank pain and intoxication.
- He has high requirements for treatment of withdrawal in progress.
- He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 153/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- He has received Valium for CIWA scale, Zofran for nausea, and his IV fluids have been decreased to 75ml/hr as he tolerates a PO diet.
- He also has transaminitis with elevated ALT/AST levels, depression/anxiety, and ADHD.
- He is currently on venlafaxine and Concerta but will hold Concerta due to acute alcohol withdrawal.
- His lab results show some abnormalities including low magnesium, low potassium, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and normal white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient is still experiencing frequent return of symptoms, indicating ongoing withdrawal. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.
2. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated ALT/AST levels, suggesting transaminitis. This could progress to alcoholic hepatitis if alcohol consumption continues. Monitoring liver function and considering RUQ ultrasound for further evaluation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with flank pain and intoxication. He is currently in the ICU for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which are being managed with Valium. The patient is also on a low-dose H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis and heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. His vital signs are stable, but he has shown some fluctuations in blood pressure. He has a history of depression, anxiety, and ADHD, for which he is taking venlafaxine and Concerta, respectively. His back pain etiology is unclear, and imaging has been negative. The patient's labs indicate mild anemia and elevated levels of potassium and bicarbonate. He is tolerating a regular diet and is expected to remain in the ICU until his CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure Scale) scores become less stringent.

Potential Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential complications that can arise include worsening alcohol withdrawal symptoms, development of delirium tremens, electrolyte imbalances, and infection due to immobility and invasive lines. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, especially blood pressure, and administer appropriate medications to manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent complications. Regular assessments of electrolyte levels and mental status should be conducted to promptly identify any abnormalities. Additionally, proper infection control measures should be maintained to minimize the risk of acquiring an infection while in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with chief complaints of ETOH withdrawal. The patient is currently alert and oriented, with no significant changes in vital signs. He has been receiving Valium for agitation and has been started on a tapering dose of Valium 10 mg every four hours based on CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) scores. The patient's laboratory values are within normal limits, except for elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient is also scheduled to receive nutritional support, prophylactic antibiotics, and deep vein thrombosis prevention. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities. The plan is to consult addiction services for rehabilitation planning and transfer the patient to the floor when he can tolerate oral intake of Valium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can lead to seizures, which can be a medical complication. The patient is currently on Valium, which helps in preventing seizures.
2. Delirium tremens (DTs): DTs is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, and tremors. The patient's agitation and need for Valium suggest that he is at risk for DTs.
3. Hypoglycemia: Chronic alcohol abuse can cause hypoglycemia. The patient's glucose"

","The patient's chief complaint is ETOH withdrawal. The patient is currently alert and oriented, with normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels. Their blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a slight elevation in heart rate. The patient's weight remains relatively unchanged since admission.

The patient's labs show a slight decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels. The white blood cell count is within normal range. The liver enzymes (AST, ALT) are within normal limits, and there are no abnormalities in the amylase or lipase levels.

The patient has been receiving IV fluids and will continue until they are tolerating oral intake. Thiamine repletion has been initiated, along with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The plan includes transitioning to oral valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and consulting addiction services. The patient will continue to be monitored closely in the ICU and will be transferred to the floor when able to manage their CIWA q4.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur 48-96 hours after the last drink. It is characterized by severe agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and autonomic instability.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can also lead to seizures, which can range from generalized tonic-clonic seizures to focal motor seizures.
3. Infections: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and impaired respiratory function"
