   -w/u for secondary causes- perform leg pressures, w/u for pheo may be
   skewed given acute setting, TSH normal 6 months ago, patient seems to
   have OSA- may at least in part be contributing to hypertension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic deep vein thrombosis (VTE), and hypertension. She presented with hypertensive emergency and delta MS. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure near the goal of systolic blood pressure (SBP) 200. She is currently on a labetalol drip to titrate to SBP 180 and prn IV hydralazine. The patient's electrolyte abnormalities have resolved, and she is euvolemic. She is awaiting to start peritoneal dialysis (PD) next week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's high blood pressure requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. It is essential to monitor her potassium levels and treat any imbalances promptly.
3. Chronic VTE: The patient has a history of chronic VTE, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and other complications related to blood clots.
4. ESRD: As the patient has ESRD, she is at an increased risk for complications related to kidney failure, including fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia.

","The patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not on dialysis, chronic deep vein thrombosis (VTE) with right upper extremity (RUE) and facial swelling, presenting with hypertensive emergency and delta myocardial infarction (MS).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 197/96 to 155/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient weighs 54 kg and is 60 inches tall.

The patient has received multiple infusions, including morphine sulfate and hydralazine. She has also been ordered labetalol drip to titrate to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of 180, and Coumadin has been held.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for neurologic symptoms such as headache, which is improving. The patient reports fatigue and blurry vision but no chest pain or dyspnea. She denies abdominal pain or nausea.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination is notable for a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs. Peripheral pulses are present bilaterally, but distal pulses are not assessed. Respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE). She presents with hypertensive emergency, delta myocardial infarction, and possible posterior reversible encephalopathic changes (PRES). Her current medications include nifedipine, hydralazine, clonidine, and a direct renin inhibitor. She is also on prednisone for SLE and keppra for seizure prophylaxis. The patient has facial swelling, which may be due to VTE or angioedema. She has anemia and metabolic acidosis likely related to renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure in the 120s on nifedipine and heart rate in the 90s. She is euvolemic and responding well to medical management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's high blood pressure can lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage if not promptly controlled.
2. Chronic VTE: The patient has a history of VTE, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.
3. ESRD: The patient's renal function is compromised, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and metabolic acidosis.
4. PRES: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   23 F with SLE, ESRD not on HD, chronic VTE with RUE and facial swelling
   p/w hypertensive emergency and delta MS.
   # HTN Emergency: BP much better controlled, now on Nifedipine 30mg CR
   [**Hospital1 **], on hydral 25mg po tid (home dose), clonidine patch, not on
   labetalol.
   -can continue uptitrating Nifedipine CR as tolerated then next step
   will be to add labetalol
   -per renal, requesting adding direct renin inhibitor, discuss with
   pharmacy as may not be availble
   -leg pressures systolic 10 points higher than upper ext.
   -secondary causes, when not in acute setting 24hr urine metanephrines,
   TSH normal, CPAP trial while inpatient vs outpatient sleep study
   # Previous Seizure in setting of HTN and possible PRES: per neuro start
   Keppra [**Hospital1 **].
   -MRI read: On the FLAIR sequence, there is evidence of hyperintensity
   areas in the parietal regions, left occipital lobe, which are
   nonspecific and may represent possible
   posterior reversible encephalopathic changes.
   # VTE. L Brachiocephalic VTE chronic with collaterals. Also h/o other
   VTE [**2-11**] to lines in the past. Currently on coumadin. INR 2.2.  Hold
   coumadin for now.  Restart likely tomorrow as patient rec'd cipro for
   UTI and likely this is increasing INR.
   # Facial Swelling. Unclear etiology likely [**2-11**] to VTE in RUE
   (brachiocephalic) vs. angioedema.
   - hold ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] for now
   - IV heparin when INR <2, restart coumadin once stable, no need for
   lines etc.
   - follow clinically.
   # ESRD. Currently no on HD due to patient preference, awaiting to start
   PD next week.
   -seems euvolemic
   -for hyperkalemia on standing kayexalate, start lasix 40mg po bid today
   as was outpatient plan and then d/c kayexalate
   -f/u renal recs
   -patient requesting regular diet, states she never complies with renal
   diet, discuss low potassium diet
   # Metabolic Acidosis: renal failure related most likely.
   -home regimen of sodium bicarb tabs 650mg- 2 tabs daily
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Anemia: drop in hct and plts but now stable, [**Hospital1 **] cbc.  since seems to
   have stabilized and BP is controlled likely aggrevating factor is no
   longer present.
   # SLE. On prednisone chronically, likely needs PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] at some point
   --Atovaquone to prevent hyperkalemia
   -continue prednisone 10mg daily
   # Dispo: ICU level of care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE). The patient presented with hypertensive emergency, likely due to secondary causes such as renal artery stenosis or pheochromocytoma. The patient's blood pressure has been better controlled with Nifedipine and hydralazine, and labetalol will be added next.

The patient also has a previous seizure in the setting of hypertension and possible posterior reversible encephalopathic changes (PRES). An MRI showed hyperintensity areas in the parietal regions and left occipital lobe, which are nonspecific and may represent possible PRES. Keppra has been started for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient has chronic VTE with right upper extremity (RUE) and facial swelling. The etiology of the facial swelling is unclear, likely related to VTE in the RUE or angioedema. ACE inhibitors have been held, and IV heparin will be started when the INR is below 2. Coumadin will be restarted once stable, without the need for lines.

The patient has ESRD and is not on hemodialysis (HD). She prefers peritoneal dialysis (PD) next week. Hyperkalemia has been managed with kayex"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), anemia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and hemolysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have high blood pressure. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated levels of troponin and lactic acid. The patient's blood counts indicate anemia and low white blood cell count. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving medications for glycemic control, stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and seizure prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible kidney dysfunction. AKI can further worsen the patient's existing ESRD.

2. Seizures: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of seizures suggest a potential risk for recurrent seizures. Seizures can lead to neurological complications and increase the patient's risk of injury.

3. Respiratory infections: Mechanical ventilation puts the"

   # HTN Emergency: Elevated this AM to 220/110. On Nifedipine 60mg CR
   [**Hospital1 **], on hydral 25mg po tid (home dose), clonidine patch. Restarted
   labetalol 600 tid. Aliskerin not available. Ordered. Should be
   available today.
   -IV labetalol 30 x 1 now
   - titrate up PO labetalol
   -If no improvement in BP, continue uptitrating Nifedipine CR
   - follow up renal recs and consider rennin inhibitor
   # Previous Seizure in setting of HTN and possible PRES: per neuro start
   Keppra [**Hospital1 **].
   -MRI read: On the FLAIR sequence, there is evidence of hyperintensity
   areas in the parietal regions, left occipital lobe, which are
   nonspecific and may represent possible posterior reversible
   encephalopathic changes.
   - Neuro signed off; contact regarding whether we can stop keppra
   # VTE. L Brachiocephalic VTE chronic with collaterals. Also h/o other
   VTE [**2-11**] to lines in the past. Currently on coumadin. INR 1.3 today
   - Restart coumadin
   # Facial Swelling. Unclear etiology likely [**2-11**] to VTE in RUE
   (brachiocephalic) vs. angioedema.
   - hold ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] for now
   - follow clinically.
   # ESRD. Currently not on HD due to patient preference; Plan to start PD
   today after TPA administered to PD catheter
   -for hyperkalemia on standing kayexalate,
   - start lasix today with plan to d/c kayexalate
   -f/u renal recs
   -patient requesting regular diet, states she never complies with renal
   diet, discuss low potassium diet
   # Metabolic Acidosis: renal failure related most likely.
   -home regimen of sodium bicarb tabs 650mg- 2 tabs daily
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
    # Anemia: drop in hct and plts but now stable, [**Hospital1 **] cbc.
   - monitor daily
    # SLE. On prednisone chronically, likely needs PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] at some point
   --Atovaquone to prevent hyperkalemia
   -continue prednisone 10mg daily
    # Dispo: ICU level of care, may call out later today or tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE). She is currently in the ICU for hypertensive emergency and delta myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 183/96 mmHg. She has a slightly elevated heart rate and normal oxygen saturation. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen, but no mechanical ventilation. 

The physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, oriented, and responds appropriately to verbal stimuli. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and normal white blood cell count. Imaging studies are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments. Further titration of nifedipine and addition of labetalol are planned to achieve better control. Aliskiren is ordered but not available yet.
2. Previous Seizure in setting of HTN and possible PRES: The patient had a seizure, and an MRI showed evidence of possible posterior reversible encephalopathic changes. Neurology is consulted, and levetiracetam (Keppra) has been started.

   23 F with SLE, ESRD not on HD, chronic VTE with RUE and facial swelling
   p/w hypertensive emergency and delta MS.
   # HTN Emergency: BP much better controlled, now on Nifedipine 60mg CR
   [**Hospital1 **], on hydral 25mg po tid (home dose), clonidine patch. Restarted
   labetalol. Aliskerin not available. Ordered. Should be available today.
   -can continue uptitrating Nifedipine CR and labetalol
   -Begin renin inhibitor today if available
   - follow up renal recs
   # Previous Seizure in setting of HTN and possible PRES: per neuro start
   Keppra [**Hospital1 **].
   -MRI read: On the FLAIR sequence, there is evidence of hyperintensity
   areas in the parietal regions, left occipital lobe, which are
   nonspecific and may represent possible posterior reversible
   encephalopathic changes.
   - Neuro signed off
   # VTE. L Brachiocephalic VTE chronic with collaterals. Also h/o other
   VTE [**2-11**] to lines in the past. Currently on coumadin. INR 2.2.  Hold
   coumadin for now.  Restart likely tomorrow as patient rec'd cipro for
   UTI and likely this is increasing INR.
   - Restart coumadin when
   # Facial Swelling. Unclear etiology likely [**2-11**] to VTE in RUE
   (brachiocephalic) vs. angioedema.
   - hold ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] for now
   - IV heparin when INR <2, restart coumadin once stable, no need for
   lines etc.
   - follow clinically.
   # ESRD. Currently not on HD due to patient preference, awaiting to
   start PD next week.
   -seems euvolemic
   -for hyperkalemia on standing kayexalate,
   - start lasix today
   -f/u renal recs
   -patient requesting regular diet, states she never complies with renal
   diet, discuss low potassium diet
   # Metabolic Acidosis: renal failure related most likely.
   -home regimen of sodium bicarb tabs 650mg- 2 tabs daily
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
    # Anemia: drop in hct and plts but now stable, [**Hospital1 **] cbc.  since seems
   to have stabilized and BP is controlled likely aggrevating factor is no
   longer present.
    # SLE. On prednisone chronically, likely needs PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] at some point
   --Atovaquone to prevent hyperkalemia
   -continue prednisone 10mg daily
    # Dispo: ICU level of care, may call out later today or tomorrow.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 23-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE). She is currently in the ICU for hypertensive emergency and delta myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 183/96 mmHg to 131/72 mmHg. Her heart rate is within normal limits, and her respiratory rate is slightly elevated. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 99%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate several abnormalities. Her potassium level is elevated at 5.1 mEq/L, and she has hyperkalemia. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting renal dysfunction. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated, indicating a potential infection. Her platelet count is within normal range. Her liver function tests show elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), indicating possible liver involvement. Her electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, and phosphate, are also abnormal.

The patient has multiple medical conditions and is receiving various medications, including antihypertensives, immunosuppressants, and anticoagulants. She requires close"

","The patient's chief complaint is hypertensive urgency. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). They also have hemolytic anemia, immunosuppression, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 204/133 mmHg, which is significantly elevated. Other vital signs are within normal limits. The patient is receiving hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid balance is being closely monitored.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms, which have improved. The physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with no significant abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. The patient is oriented and neurologically intact.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while platelet count is within normal range. Troponin T levels are within normal limits, indicating no signs of cardiac injury.

The patient's plan includes initiating peritoneal dialysis (PD) and managing high blood pressure. The initial medication, nifedipine, is causing too great of a drop in blood pressure, so it will be replaced with labetalol. Calcium channel blockers may also be considered to further control blood pressure.

Overall, the patient's main concern is hypertensive urgency, and they are being managed with appropriate medications and close"

   Plan to initiate PD today. BP remains elevated - we are restarting her
   out patient meds.  Nifedipine is a problem - she is responsive but too
   responsive as BP drops. Will increase labetolol first then consider
   increasing Ca++ channel blocker.  Hct stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Her vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 204/133 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus rhythm and normal fluid balance.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and soft abdomen with a peritoneal dialysis catheter. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, oriented to time, place, and person, and follows simple commands. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10400 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 7.4 mg/dL, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 117 mEq/L, and hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 6.8 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 23-year-old female with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE). She presented with a hypertensive emergency and was found to have elevated blood pressure readings throughout the day. She is currently on multiple antihypertensive medications including nifedipine, hydralazine, clonidine, and labetalol. Additionally, she has been started on a direct renin inhibitor called aliskiren.

The patient's VTE has resulted in right upper extremity (RUE) swelling, which could be due to collateral circulation or angioedema. She is currently on warfarin for anticoagulation, but her INR is subtherapeutic at 1.3. Her ESRD has led to metabolic acidosis and anemia, both of which are being monitored closely. She is not currently on dialysis but will be initiating peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the near future.

The patient also has a history of possible posterior reversible encephalopathic syndrome (PRES) and is being treated with levetiracetam (Keppra). She has been advised to follow up with neurology regarding the continuation of this medication.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 23-year-old female with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not on dialysis, chronic venous thromboembolism (VTE) with right upper extremity and facial swelling. The patient presented with a hypertensive emergency and was initially managed with nifedipine, hydralazine, and labetalol. She also has a history of possible posterior reversible encephalopathic changes (PRES) and is currently on levetiracetam. The patient has chronic VTE and is on warfarin with an INR of 1.3. Her facial swelling is unclear etiology, possibly related to VTE or angioedema. The patient is not currently on dialysis but will be starting peritoneal dialysis (PD). She has metabolic acidosis likely related to renal failure and anemia with a drop in hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient is also on prednisone for SLE management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's high blood pressure requires immediate management to prevent end-organ damage. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications are necessary.
2. Possible PRES: The patient's previous seizure in the setting of hypertension and MRI findings suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathic changes indicate a potential risk for neurological complications. Monitoring for neurological symptoms"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency. He has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), anemia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), history of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and upper extremity thrombosis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 183/101 to 131/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient is currently receiving peritoneal dialysis and has been experiencing labile and difficult-to-control blood pressure. He is also experiencing nausea but has a relatively benign examination otherwise. The plan is to initiate PD if the catheter can be cleared, as it is hoped that BP will be easier to control on dialysis. 

The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels and a decreased hemoglobin level. Other lab results are within normal range. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypertension, further decline in renal function, development of infections related to the peritoneal dialysis catheter, and potential bleeding due to elevated PT/INR levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypertensive urgency
   SLE
   Anemia
   ESRD
   Peritoneal dialysis
   OSA
   H/O PRESS
   UE thrombosis
   BP remains labile and difficult to control on home regime.  Plan to
   initiate PD if catheter can be cleared.  Hopefully BP will be easier to
   control on dialysis. C/O nausea this am but exam is relatively benign.
   Will watch through day.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypertensive urgency. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), anemia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The patient is currently undergoing peritoneal dialysis due to ESRD and has unstable blood pressure that is difficult to control. The patient complains of nausea but has a relatively benign examination. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's high blood pressure may lead to complications such as cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, or aortic dissection if not properly managed.
2. SLE flare-up: As the patient has a history of SLE, there is a possibility of a flare-up or worsening of the disease, which can affect multiple organ systems.
3. Anemia exacerbation: The patient's anemia could worsen if there is inadequate treatment or if there are complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. ESRD progression: The patient's end-stage renal disease may progress further, leading to further decline in kidney function and potential complications related to renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of catheters and lines, as well as his immunocompromised state.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's"
