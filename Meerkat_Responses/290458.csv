","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with no past medical history, presenting with weakness and vomiting due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the setting of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM). He was started on an arterial line and required a high dose of insulin drip, which was titrated down to 10 units per hour. Lipase levels were elevated while amylase levels were normal. The patient's blood glucose levels have been in the 130s, and his condition has improved. His allergies include aspirin and penicillins. He is currently on D5NS at 75 cc/hr and regular insulin at 10 units/hour. 

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with profound acidosis and an anion gap of 28, which has now decreased to 8 after receiving IV fluids and an insulin drip overnight. Continuous monitoring of blood sugar levels and electrolytes is necessary. The patient may require potassium and phosphate supplementation.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, but this could be due to anxiety and dehydration. Regular monitoring is recommended.

3. Sinus tachycardia: The patient has a slightly elevated heart rate, which could be attributed to dehydration and anxiety. Monitoring the heart rate is advised.

4. Lack of primary care physician (PCP): The patient does not have a PCP, and it will be necessary to arrange for one"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 36-year-old male with no past medical history, presented with weakness and vomiting caused by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the setting of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient required high doses of insulin overnight due to significant insulin resistance. His lipase level is elevated, while amylase and complement levels are normal. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is tachycardic and has slightly elevated blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an adequate intake of fluids with minimal output, resulting in a positive fluid balance. Respiratory support is not required, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 96%. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for the presence of ketones in the urine. Laboratory results indicate hyperglycemia, elevated white blood cell count, and decreased hematocrit and platelet count. Renal function is impaired, as indicated by increased serum creatinine levels. Other lab values, including liver enzymes and electrolytes, are within normal ranges. The patient's arterial line was inserted due to the need for continuous blood glucose monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels require ongoing management with insulin to prevent further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA, which is a medical emergency caused by a combination of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with diabetes mellitus type I and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has been receiving high doses of insulin and is showing signs of insulin resistance. His lipase levels are elevated while amylase levels are normal. The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin and penicillins. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-142/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 292 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. His laboratory results indicate elevated glucose levels, slightly low potassium, and normal white blood cell count. The patient is currently on insulin infusion and is being monitored closely. Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of glycemic control, hypoglycemia, infections due to prolonged ICU stay, and potential cardiovascular complications related to his underlying diabetes and DKA."

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old gentleman with no past medical history presenting with weakness and vomiting from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the setting of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM). He was initially found to have profound acidosis with an anion gap (AG) of 28 on initial labs, which has improved to 7 after receiving intravenous fluids and insulin drip. The patient is now on a basal dose of insulin and a sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient presented with DKA, a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. It requires immediate medical attention and management.
2. Hypoglycemia - The patient is on insulin therapy, which carries the risk of hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of blood sugar levels will be necessary to prevent and manage this condition.
3. Hyperkalemia - The patient has received multiple repletions of potassium due to ongoing losses. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is required to prevent hyperkalemia.
4. Hypophosphatemia - The patient may require ongoing supplementation of phosphate due to shifts from extracellular to intracellular spaces during treatment for DKA. Monitoring of phosphate levels is important to prevent hypophosphatemia.
5. Diabetic nephropathy - Long-term management of diabetes can lead to kidney damage and diabetic neph"

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA): Likely from new onset DM.  Presented
   with profound acidosis with an AG of 28 on initial labs, now 7 after IV
   fluids and insulin drip and now on basal dose and sliding scale.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old gentleman with no past medical history presenting with weakness and vomiting due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the setting of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM). He is currently being treated in the ICU for DKA. His arterial blood gas (ABG) initially showed an anion gap (AG) of 28, which has now decreased to 7 after receiving IV fluids and an insulin drip. The patient is now on basal insulin and a sliding scale regimen. He requires close monitoring of his blood sugar levels every other hour, potassium, and phosphate supplementation. Diabetic teaching and outpatient follow-up are also necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia/Hypoglycemia: As the patient is on insulin therapy, there is a risk of developing hypoglycemia if the insulin dose is not adjusted properly. On the other hand, if the insulin dose is inadequate, it can lead to persistent hyperglycemia.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Recurrence: Although the patient's AG has improved, there is still a risk of DKA recurrence if the patient does not adhere to the prescribed diabetic diet, takes insulin irregularly, or develops an infection.
3. Hypokalemia/Hyperkalemia: Due to the patient's requirement of potassium supplementation, there is a risk of developing hypokalemia if the potassium levels are not carefully monitored and managed. Conversely"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old individual with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's medical history includes type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and they presented with an elevated blood glucose level of 233 mg/dL. 

Upon admission, the patient was started on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient's condition has since improved, with their blood glucose levels decreasing to 167 mg/dL. The patient has also advanced to a full diet and is receiving diabetic teaching. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 125/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal neurological findings. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin of 13.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 201 K/uL. The creatinine level has returned to normal, indicating improvement in renal function. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,643 mL and output of 3,675 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 968 mL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and no rashes or jaundice.
