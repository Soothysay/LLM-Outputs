   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old man with hx of multiple sclerosis c/b paraplegia, DM2, PUD,
   agitated depression, and aspiration presenting from nursing home after
   being found unresponsive, hypotensive,  hypoxic, and with evidence of
   GI bleed.
    1)  Shock: Patient was admitted with a lactate of 5.4, bandemia (21
   bands) and signs of end-organ dysfunction (mental status and elevated
   Cr) in setting of likely infection, so sepsis is the most likely
   etiology.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be complicated by a GI bleed as patient has had
   significant UGIB in the past.  Potential sources of infection include
   UTI, pneumonia, infected pressure ulcer given severiety of wound on L
   heel. Patient also at risk for hospital acquired pathogens.  Initially
   started on vanc/zosyn for broad coverage.  Efforts were made at
   aggressive volume resuscitation on admission with compromise of
   patient's respiratory status (increased pulmonary edema and work of
   breathing).
   - Goals of care discussed at length with patient's HCP, his nephew.
   [**Name (NI) 53**] would not want intubation or resuscitation.   Given his current
   clinical state, the decision was made to pursue comfort care. The
   patient was started on low morphine as he is able to acknowledge he is
   not in pain.  Will accelerated to morphine gtt if patient becomes
   uncomfortable or develops increased work of breathing.
   - No further lab draws, comfort medications only
   - Will continue close discussions with family
   2) Hypoxia: DDX pneumonia or early ARDS from urosepsis complicated by
   volume resuscitation.  Currrently oxygenating well with NC and shovel
   mask.
   - Continue current management given patient appears to be clinically
   comfortable
   3) Acute blood loss anemia on admission: patient has hx of severe PUD
   with gastritis and visible vessel now with BRBPR and decrease (although
   mild) in Hct.
   - No current management, no longer trending Hct
   4) Altered Mental status: non-focal neuro exam in patient with history
   of agitated depression.
   - Attempt to correct shock as above
   - Patient able to communicate with effort
   5) Acute renal failure: likely pre-renal +/- ATN.
   - No longer trending, patient has indwelling foley at baseline given
   neurogenic bladder from MS.
   6) Dispo: Patient is currently comfort measures. Will likely be able to
   call out today to a private room. Will consider palliative care
   consult.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, peptic ulcer disease, and agitation/depression. He was admitted from a nursing home with hypotension, hypoxemia, acute renal failure, and mental status changes. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and pressure ulcers. He was found unresponsive and required fluid resuscitation. The initial plan was to provide comfort care, but after discussions with the healthcare team, the patient's nephew agreed to pursue aggressive treatment within the patient's wishes. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and his mental status has improved.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1) Shock: The patient's history of infection, end-organ dysfunction, and signs of shock indicate the possibility of septic shock. This is further complicated by a potential gastrointestinal bleed due to his past history of significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
2) Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and the possibility of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from urosepsis may lead to continued hypoxia. Oxygenation is currently being managed with a nasal cannula and shovel mask.
3) Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's history of severe peptic ulcer disease and the current presentation with visible bleeding suggest the possibility of ongoing blood loss and acute blood loss anemia.
4) Altered mental status: The patient's non-focal neuro exam and history of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple sclerosis who is currently in the ICU for sepsis and possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory distress, acute renal failure (ARF), and a potential GI bleed. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory distress, which has since stabilized after aggressive volume resuscitation. He is currently on comfort care only and is not expected to regain decision-making capacity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, and death if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress due to pneumonia and volume resuscitation. This could progress to acute respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further due to sepsis, hypovolemia, and other underlying conditions, potentially leading to permanent kidney damage or end-stage renal disease.
4. GI Bleed: The patient's possible GI bleed could worsen and cause significant blood loss, leading to hypotension, shock, and multiorgan failure.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged stay on mechanical ventilation, he is at an increased risk of developing VAP, which can complicate his respiratory status"

","The patient's chief complaint is sepsis, and they have been admitted to the ICU for care. The patient's family meeting decided to make them comfort care only. The patient remains persistently tachycardic.

The patient's allergies include Prozac (oral) and unknown allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently receiving various infusions and other ICU medications.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted above and below. The review of systems indicates dyspnea under respiratory.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but they are experiencing sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 125 bpm. Blood pressure is low at 93/46 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has received a total of 1,250 mL of IV fluids since 12 AM, with a total output of 540 mL of urine and 440 mL of blood products. The balance shows a negative fluid balance of 440 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has fair air movement in their chest. Physical examination reveals that the patient is lying in bed, speaking but tachypneic, with very dry orophary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, peptic ulcer disease, agitation, and depression. He was admitted from a nursing home after being found unresponsive, hypotensive, hypoxic, and with evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has several medical complications including shock, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, hypoxemia, ARF, and mental status changes suggests sepsis as the most likely etiology. Potential sources of infection include urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, and infected pressure ulcer.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of significant UGIB, which could complicate his current condition.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia and respiratory failure due to compromised respiratory status.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate pre-renal azotemia, possibly due to septic shock and hypovolemia.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be a result of septic shock and hypovolemia.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has significant pressure ulcers that require wound care and prevention measures.
7. Aspiration Risk"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, peptic ulcer disease, agitation, and depression. He was admitted to the ICU from another hospital with hypotension, hypoxemia, acute renal failure, and mental status changes. The patient has a background of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and pressure ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with signs of septic shock, including high lactate levels, bandemia, and evidence of end-organ dysfunction.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to his underlying peptic ulcer disease.
3. Infection: Potential sources of infection include urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, and infected pressure ulcers.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, which improved with fluid resuscitation.
5. Tachycardia: The patient experienced sinus tachycardia, likely due to septic shock and hypovolemia.
6. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with hypoxemia, which could be due to pneumonia or early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from urosepsis.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has significant pressure ulcers that require wound care management.
8. Aspiration Risk: The patient aspirates with oral intake, necessitating a speech and"

   80 year old man with hx of multiple sclerosis c/b paraplegia, DM2, PUD,
   agitated depression, and aspiration presenting from nursing home after
   being found unresponsive, hypotensive,  hypoxic, and with evidence of
   GI bleed.
   #  Shock: Patient was admitted with a lactate of 5.4, bandemia (21
   bands) and signs of end-organ dysfunction (mental status and elevated
   Cr) in setting of likely infection, so sepsis is the most likely
   etiology.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be complicated by a GI bleed as patient has had
   significant UGIB in the past.  Potential sources of infection include
   UTI, pneumonia, infected pressure ulcer given severiety of wound on L
   heel. Patient also at risk for hospital acquired pathogens.  Initially
   started on vanc/zosyn for broad coverage.  Efforts were made at
   aggressive volume resuscitation on admission with compromise of
   patient's respiratory status (increased pulmonary edema and work of
   breathing).  Goals of care discussed at length with patient's HCP, his
   nephew.  [**Name (NI) 53**] would not want intubation or resuscitation.   Given
   his clinical state, the decision was made to pursue comfort care. The
   patient was started on low morphine.  Patient maintained blood pressure
   and oxygen sat overnight, with persistent sinus tachycardia.  Mental
   status improved this am.  Patient able to communicate and vital signs
   stable. Given clinical improvement, discussed pursuing more aggressive
   treatment within patient
s wishes.
   - DNR/DNI as per his wishes
   - Restarted small fluid boluses, 100cc/hr now s/p 2 L
   - Lactate at 1.9 yesterday down from 5.4
   - Restarted Vanc/Zosyn for broad sepsis coverage
   - Follow bcx, ucx, legionella urinary ag
   - Continue NC and shovel mask, titrate oxygen as needed
   - Will continue close discussions with family
   # Hypoxia: DDX pneumonia or early ARDS from urosepsis complicated by
   volume resuscitation.  Currrently oxygenating well with NC and shovel
   mask.
   - Continue current management given patient appears to be clinically
   comfortable
   - No intubation, so will bolus fluids carefully
   - Consider CXR today if develops increased hypoxia
   # Acute blood loss anemia on admission: patient has hx of severe PUD
   with gastritis and visible vessel now with BRBPR and decrease (although
   mild) in Hct.
   - Will trend HCT, transfuse for active bleeding or >30
   - Down to 28 today though after fluid resuscitation, will consider 1u
   prbcs today
   # Altered Mental status: non-focal neuro exam in patient with history
   of agitated depression.
   - Correcting shock as above
   - Patient able to communicate with effort
   # Acute renal failure: likely pre-renal +/- ATN. Improved to baseline.
   - Continue fluids prn for sepsis/hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Has been in sinus with APCs. Initially persistently in
   the 130s, now down to 110s with fluids. Likely combination of septic
   shock and hypovolemia.
   - Continue current management with gentle IVF to correct underlying
   disorder
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - ECG this morning.
   # Dispo: Continue current management. Close discussions with family
   regarding progression.  Will restart home medications. Plan to call out

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, peptic ulcer disease, agitation, and depression. He was admitted from a nursing home after being found unresponsive, hypotensive, hypoxic, and with evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is stable with improved vital signs. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam) for suspected sepsis. His mental status has improved, and he is able to communicate. The patient's goals of care include comfort measures, avoiding intubation or resuscitation, and pursuing aggressive treatment within his wishes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient presented with signs of end-organ dysfunction, bandemia, and elevated lactate levels, indicating septic shock. This is being managed with aggressive volume resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia could be due to pneumonia or early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from urosepsis. He is currently oxygenating well with a nasal cannula and shovel mask. Close monitoring and consideration of a chest X-ray if there is increased hypoxia will be necessary.

3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has a history of severe peptic ulcer disease, which may have contributed to his current anemia. Active bleeding or a significant decrease in hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yr old man with hx of multipe sclerosis presents with septic shock
   and possible GI bleed.
   1. Sepsis: Multiple potential etiologies with UTI and PNA most likely
   and possible osteo with bacteremia from left heel abscess and stage IV
   sacral decub - Covered broadly with Vanco, Zosyn, pending data from pan
   culture, foley has been changed, foot films.
   Clinically improved. He is s/p aggressive volume resuscitation
   complicated by resp distress
 this resp distress has since stabilized
   and we have resumed volume repletion.
   2. Resp distress: in setting of PNA and likely vasc leak with volume
   resuscitation, he is DNI and breathing has stabilized. Watch carefully
   as resume hydration.
   3.  ARF: in setting of sepsis and hypovolemia, s/p volume resusitating.
   Cr improved 1.4--> 1.1.
   4. GI bleed: Possible recurrent gastritis, bleeding vessel, ischemia.
   At this point supportive care with blood. Hct at baseline.
   5. Code: Was CMO Saturday afternoon when severe resp distress. Now that
   he has improved we have discussed with nephew return to DNR/DNI status
   but will resume fluids, ABX and continue supportive care. Of he worsens
   again from a resp status we will readdress.

","The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of multiple sclerosis who presents with septic shock and possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He also has respiratory failure and is receiving hydration for resuscitation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/59 mmHg to 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He is receiving fluids and antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.8 K/uL, elevated hematocrit of 33.1%, and decreased platelet count of 326. Other lab values indicate elevated creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, low glucose level of 92 mg/dL, and abnormal arterial blood gas results.

Assessment and plan:
1. Sepsis: Multiple potential etiologies with urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia (PNA) most likely, and possible osteomyelitis with bacteremia from left heel abscess and stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer. Covered broadly with vancomycin and Zosyn, pending data from pan culture, foley has been changed, foot films.
