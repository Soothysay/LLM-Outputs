","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old Cambodian female who presented with a moderate to large pericardial effusion, which was causing intermittent palpitations and worsening shortness of breath with exertion. She underwent elective pericardial drainage, during which 600 cc of bloody fluid was drained. A follow-up echocardiogram showed a residual small effusion located posterior to the right atrium. The patient has been doing well without any acute complaints since the procedure.

The patient has a history of renal transplantation for IgA nephropathy-related renal failure. Her current creatinine level is 1.6, which is around her baseline. The renal team recommends continuing CellCept at 500 mg PO BID and Rapamycin at mg/day. The patient's sirolimus level is 4.2, below the normal range.

The patient also has hypertension and bipolar disorder, for which she is currently taking Amlodipine 5 mg and Toprol, and Benztropine and Risperidal therapy, respectively.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: Given the presence of bloody fluid drained from the pericardial effusion, there is a potential risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or worsening symptoms, is essential.

2. Cardiac tamponade: Although the pericardial effusion has been drained, there is still a small residual effusion present. This could"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, the patient is a 46-year-old cambodian speaking female who
   presents s/p elective drainage for a moderate to large size pericardial
   effusion noted on echocardiogram after patient was worked up for 1
   month of intermittent palpitation episodes and worsening shortness of
   breath with exertion. She had no signs or symptoms of overt tamponade
   and is otherwise stable.
   .
   #Pericardial Effusion: patient underwent elective pericardial drainage
   earlier this afternoon and has drain in place currently with 600cc+
   sanguinous fluid removed. Lab data c/w hemopericardium. Underlying
   etiology of effusion is unclear, but could be due to malignancy, TB,
   fungal infections, viral infections, lyme disease, a collagen vascular
   disease, or drug effects (case reports of either Cellcept or Rapamune)
   or idiopathic.
   - will monitor with telemetry
   - measure overnight output from pericardial drainage, once tapers and
   stops draining will consider removal
   - follow-up cytology, gram stain, culture, thyroid and SLE tests
   (dsDNA, complement) &  anti-thyroglobulin Ab
   - repeat ECHO in a.m.
   - CXR in a.m.
   - EKG in a.m.
   - serial pulsus checks q8 hrs
   .
   #Bradycardia - patient had brief episode of bradycardia with
   hypotension immediately post-procedure after drainage which was
   attributed to a vagal reaction. Patient stabilized smoothly after 1mg
   Atropine given. Stable since CCU arrival with HR 70-80s, SBPs 105-130s
   range.
   .
   #Renal Transplant: status post renal transplant [**11-18**] for IgA
   nephropathy related renal failure. Current Cr 1.4 which is patient's
   baseline. Appreciate renal team's recommendations and will continue
   CellCept at 500mg PO BID and Rapamycin mg/day.
   - Continue Calcium & Vitamin D supplement
   - CBC/Chem7
   - check Sirolimus level in a.m.

   # Hypertension: will plan to continue Amlodipine 5mg and Toprol 100mg
   with hold parameters for SBP < 105 given recent bout of hypotension
   post-drainage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, presenting with intermittent palpitations and worsening shortness of breath. She underwent elective drainage for a moderate to large pericardial effusion. The underlying cause of the effusion is unclear, but it could be due to malignancy, tuberculosis, fungal infections, viral infections, Lyme disease, collagen vascular disease, or drug effects. The patient is currently stable with no signs or symptoms of overt tamponade.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a drain in place with sanguinous fluid removed, increasing the risk of infection. Monitoring with telemetry and following up with cytology, gram stain, culture, thyroid, and SLE tests will help identify any potential infections.
2. Bleeding: As the fluid removed from the pericardial space was described as sanguinous, there is a risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of vital signs and coagulation parameters will be necessary.
3. Bradycardia: The patient experienced a brief episode of bradycardia post-procedure, which was attributed to a vagal reaction. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect any further episodes.
4. Renal function: The patient has a history of renal transplant, and her current creatinine level is within baseline. Regular monitoring of renal function and following the recommendations of the renal team will be important.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of"
