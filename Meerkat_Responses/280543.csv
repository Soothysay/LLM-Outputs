   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 year old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension,
   dCHF, HIV, DM, OSA, Morbid obesity who presnts to the ED with Dyspnea
   and increasing edema.
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial.  Concerns are for worsening pulmonary
   artery hypertension, infection, CHF.  Infectious etiologies include
   normal pneumonias or oportunistic pathogens such as PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1256**] CD4
   count is 385 ([**February 2183**]).  Aother possibilities include CAD/anginal
   equivalent, PE or anxiety.  Patient has been afebrile and there are no
   signs of infection on history and physcial.  WBC is not elevated.  dCHF
   is certainly a possibility however his BMP was not elevated.  Also no
   real O2 requirement just subjective dyspnea.  Still in the setting of
   volume overload this is a consideration.  Unlikely to be CAD or anginal
   equvalent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be partly contributed by anxiety.
   -Hold lasix currently given hyptensive episode.  If pressures stable
   overnight re-start in am.
   -Continue Sildenafil TID
   -Hep gtt for possible PE (increased risk given PAH)
   -ROMI
   -check CD4 count
   -LDH
   -LFTs
   # Pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **] HTN: Difficult treating.  Presumed due to HIV and
   dCHF.  Has not been able to tolerate sildenafil as getting ""drunk""
   feelings.  Per recent notes from end of 09 patient seems to be getting
   worse.
   -D/w attending further treatment for PAH, Flolan or other inhailed
   vasodilator.
   -Continue Sildenafil
   -O2 as needed
   -CPAP overnight
   -Consider dig.
   -Assess for pulmonary rehab.
   # Hyperkalemia: K often runs in upper 5s and occasionally lower 6.
   Currently is elevated.  S/p Ca in ED and Kayexelate.  No ECG changes.
   Likely related to renal disase.
   -Kayxelate
   -ECG in am
   -Low K diet.
   # dCHF: Presumed based on Echo and R heart cath.  LV EF preserved and
   hyperdynamic.  Elevated E wave acceleration time.  Unclear if currently
   worse given normal BNP and lack of true desaturation.  Do not suspect
   that dCHF is causing large component of DOE at this time.
   -Holding lasix given sensative preload with PAH and recent hypotensive
   episode.
   # HIV:  Last CD4 count in [**2-17**] was 384.  Patient currently on ARVT.
   -Continue ARV while in house.
   -Check CD4 count, if low consider oportunistic infections.
   # Anemia: Currently stable.  Attributable to HIV and multiple medical
   illenss.
   -Trend hct
   -Transfuse if < 21
   # OSA: Patient with history of noncompliance of CPAP in past, currently
   tolerating it well.  CPAP seems to improve his breathing.
   -CPAP at night
   # Acute renal failre: [**Month (only) 51**] be in setting of increase diuresis.  Recieved
   some fluid in ED.  Will hold am lasix and trend Cr.
   -F/u cr.  If worsening will send urine lytes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), HIV, diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and morbid obesity.
- The patient presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath (SOB) and increasing edema.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions and is currently in the ICU.
- The patient's dyspnea is likely multifactorial, with concerns for worsening pulmonary artery hypertension, infection, and CHF.
- Infectious etiologies include normal pneumonias or opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
- Other possibilities include coronary artery disease (CAD) or angina equivalent, pulmonary embolism (PE), or anxiety.
- The patient's white blood cell count is not elevated, and there are no signs of infection on history and physical examination.
- CHF is a possibility, but the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was not elevated, and there is no real oxygen requirement, suggesting that it may not be the primary cause of the dyspnea.
- Unlikely to be CAD or anginal equivalent. Anxiety may partly contribute to the dyspnea.
- Lasix (a diuretic) is being held due to a recent hypotensive episode, and will be restarted in the morning if blood pressures are stable.
- The patient is currently on sildenafil for pulmonary"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 year old male with a history of pulmonary HCV (s/p
   successful interferon), stage IV cirrhosis, dCHF, HIV, DM, OSA, Morbid
   obesity who presents to the ED with Dyspnea and increasing edema.
   58 y/o severe pulm HTN, HIV >> diastolic dysfunction, cirrhosis,
   admitted with ARF and dyspnea.
   Feels improved today
 etiology for decompensation still unclear.  Had
   not been diuresed significantly by the time he was feeling better,
   improvement may be simply due to supplemental O2.  Further hx suggests
   some chills and malaise, reasonable to cover for CAP given basilar
   opacities.  Volume overload by exam and hx
 BNP inconsistent - will

   Reasonable to check repeat echo in meantime.
   Remainder of plan as above.
   Pt is critically ill.  CC time 35 minutes.
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial.  Concerns are for worsening pulmonary
   artery hypertension, infection, CHF.  Infectious etiologies include
   normal pneumonias or oportunistic pathogens such as PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1256**] CD4
   count is 385 ([**February 2183**]).  Aother possibilities include CAD/anginal
   equivalent, PE or anxiety.  Patient has been afebrile and there are no
   signs of infection on history and physcial.  WBC is not elevated.  dCHF
   is certainly a possibility however his BMP was not elevated.  Also no
   real O2 requirement just subjective dyspnea.  Still in the setting of
   volume overload this is a consideration.  Unlikely to be CAD or anginal
   equvalent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be partly contributed by anxiety.
   -Hold lasix currently given hyptensive episode.  If pressures stable
   overnight re-start in am.
   -Continue Sildenafil TID
   -Hep gtt for possible PE (increased risk given PAH)
   -ROMI
   -check CD4 count
   -LDH

   # Pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **] HTN: Difficult treating.  Presumed due to HIV and
   dCHF.  Has not been able to tolerate sildenafil as getting ""drunk""
   feelings.  Per recent notes from end of 09 patient seems to be getting
   worse.
   -D/w attending further treatment for PAH, Flolan or other inhailed
   vasodilator.
   -Continue Sildenafil
   -O2 as needed
   -CPAP overnight
   -Consider dig.
   -Assess for pulmonary rehab.
   # Hyperkalemia: K often runs in upper 5s and occasionally lower 6.
   Currently is elevated.  S/p Ca in ED and Kayexelate.  No ECG changes.
   Likely related to renal disase.
   -Kayxelate
   -ECG in am
   -Low K diet.
   # dCHF: Presumed based on Echo and R heart cath.  LV EF preserved and
   hyperdynamic.  Elevated E wave acceleration time.  Unclear if currently
   worse given normal BNP and lack of true desaturation.  Do not suspect
   that dCHF is causing large component of DOE at this time.
   -Holding lasix given sensative preload with PAH and recent hypotensive
   episode.
   # HIV:  Last CD4 count in [**2-17**] was 384.  Patient currently on ARVT.
   -Continue ARV while in house.
   -Check CD4 count, if low consider oportunistic infections.
   # Anemia: Currently stable.  Attributable to HIV and multiple medical
   illenss.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, stage IV cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, HIV, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and increasing edema. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and possible pulmonary embolism. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been started on dialysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's history of severe pulmonary hypertension may contribute to his dyspnea and could potentially lead to right heart failure.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF, which could be exacerbated by his current symptoms and medical conditions.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and the need for dialysis.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
5. Possible Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of immobilization and risk factors, there is a concern for PE, which could lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
6. HIV and Associated Infections: As an immunocompromised patient with HIV, the patient is at increased risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocyst"

   admitted with ARF and dyspnea.
   Feels improved today
 etiology for decompensation still unclear.  Had
   not been diuresed significantly by the time he was feeling better,
   improvement may be simply due to supplemental O2.  Further hx suggests
   some chills and malaise, reasonable to cover for CAP given basilar

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of long-standing HIV, pulmonary hypertension, HCV, stage IV cirrhosis, diastolic heart failure, morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, renal insufficiency, and previous hyperkalemia. He presents to the emergency department with weight gain, chills, dyspnea, and increasing edema. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, and his condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening pulmonary artery hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to worsening of symptoms such as dyspnea.
2. Infection: Despite being afebrile and lacking signs of infection on history and physical examination, the patient's low white blood cell count raises concern for opportunistic infections like pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms, including dyspnea and edema, may be indicative of CHF, especially considering his history of diastolic heart failure and cirrhosis.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's risk factors for PE, such as immobility and history of pulmonary hypertension, this should be considered as a possible cause of his symptoms.
5. Anxiety: The patient's dyspnea could be partly attributed to anxiety, especially considering his history of obstructive sleep apnea"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 year old male with a history of long-standing HIV on
   HAART, pulmonary hypertension, HCV (s/p successful interferon), stage
   IV cirrhosis, dCHF, morbid obesity, DM, OSA, renal insufficiency and
   previous hyperkalemia, who presents to the ED with weight gain, chills,
   dyspnea and increasing edema, ARF. Today he endorses headache and
   myalgia.
   # Dyspnea
   Likely multifactorial and numerous possibilities including typical and
   atypical pneumonias, pulmonary hypertension, fluid overload, pulmonary
   embolism. Fluid overload and exacerabation of CHF not supported by BNP.
   Crackles in this context would be unimpressive given pulmonary
   hypertension (as we see today, with few crackles). Infection possible
   given malaise, chills, will therefore send nasopharyngeal swab for flu.
   Await CD4 to determine DDx for organisms. Concerns are for worsening
   pulmonary artery hypertension, although again without evidence of
   raised BNP. PE possible, but pressures good and again. This is low
   suspicion given subacute presentation and present improvement.  Patient
   has been afebrile. He is likely feeling more comfortable because of O2
   therapy. WBC is not elevated, but will need to see were HIV activity is
   before difinitive. Unlikely to be CAD or anginal equvalent. Patient
   endorses quite some fluid overload.
   - Given stability and increased weight, will diurese and evaluate
   effect.
   - Continue Sildenafil TID
   - Hep gtt for possible PE (increased risk given PAH)
   - Check LENIs as proxy for CTA given renal function and low likelihood
   - Await cell counts (CD4)
   - Echo
   - Lasix drip to 50 cc/hr out minimum
   # Pulmonary Arterial HTN
   Difficult treating.  Presumed due to HIV and dCHF. Has not been able to
   tolerate sildenafil as getting ""drunk"" feelings.  Per recent notes from
   end of 09 patient seems to be getting worse.
   - D/w outpatient Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 9749**] treatment for PAH, Flolan or other
   inhailed vasodilator.
   - Continue Sildenafil in this setting
   - O2 as needed
   - CPAP overnight
   - Consider dig.
   - Echo
   - Assess for pulmonary rehab.
   # Hyperkalemia
   K often runs in upper 5s and occasionally lower 6.  Per patient, this
   correlates with renal failure. Somewhat surprising elevation given
   level of renal failure. On ACEI which may also contribute. Possible
   heparin effect.
   - Control with polystyrene today, then more HD on Renal
s advice
   - Low K diet
   # HCV/Liver failure
   Liver failure may also have resulted in some relatively opaque ascites
   in this patient that may account for some weight gain, malaise.
   Therefore also possible SBP. This would also be consistent with pleural
   effusion
 mild effusion is seen.
   - Bedside ultrasound
   - Diuresis
   # dCHF
   Presumed based on Echo and R heart cath.  Unclear if currently worse
   given normal BNP and lack of true desaturation.  Do not suspect that
   dCHF is causing large component of DOE at this time. Nonetheless,
   weight gain is likely fluid. Will trial diuresis.
   - Lasix drip
   # HIV
   Last CD4 count in [**2-17**] was 384.  Patient currently on ARVT. Patient
   was
long term survivor
 off treatment. Likely CD4 count okay, but need
   to evaluate before narrowing differentials for possible pulmonary
   process.
   - Continue ARV while in house
   - Await CD4 count
   # Anemia, near-leucopenia
   Currently stable.  Attributable to HIV and multiple medical illnesses.
   -Trend hct
   -Transfuse if < 21
   # OSA
   Patient with history of noncompliance of CPAP in past, currently
   tolerating it well.  CPAP seems to improve his breathing.
   -CPAP at night
   # Acute renal failre
   Concern for poor renal perfusion given possible fluid overload (BNP
   does not support) versus over-diuresis with recent increase in Lasix at
   home. Will trend Cr and trial diuresis.
   -F/u Cr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including long-standing HIV on HAART, pulmonary hypertension, HCV (s/p successful interferon), stage IV cirrhosis, dCHF, morbid obesity, DM, OSA, renal insufficiency, and previous hyperkalemia. The patient presented to the ED with weight gain, chills, dyspnea, and increasing edema, ARF. 

The patient's current assessment includes dyspnea, pulmonary arterial hypertension, potential pulmonary embolism, fluid overload, anemia, near-leukopenia, and acute renal failure. The plan includes diuresis to manage fluid overload, continuing sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension, awaiting CD4 count for HIV evaluation, and an echocardiogram.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's symptoms of dyspnea, malaise, and risk factors such as immobility, obesity, and pulmonary hypertension, there is a concern for a possible PE. Further evaluation with lower extremity venous ultrasound (Hep gtt) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be necessary.

2. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of dCHF, and symptoms like weight gain, edema, and crackles on auscultation raise concerns for worsening cardiac function. Diuretic"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 year old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension,
   dCHF, HIV, DM, OSA, Morbid obesity who presnts to the ED with Dyspnea
   and increasing edema.
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial.  Concerns are for worsening pulmonary
   artery hypertension, infection, CHF.  Infectious etiologies include
   normal pneumonias or oportunistic pathogens such as PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1256**] CD4
   count is 385 ([**February 2183**]).  Aother possibilities include CAD/anginal
   equivalent, PE or anxiety.  Patient has been afebrile and there are no
   signs of infection on history and physcial.  WBC is not elevated.  dCHF
   is certainly a possibility however his BMP was not elevated.  Also no
   real O2 requirement just subjective dyspnea.  Still in the setting of
   volume overload this is a consideration.  Unlikely to be CAD or anginal
   equvalent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be partly contributed by anxiety.
   -Hold lasix currently given hyptensive episode.  If pressures stable
   overnight re-start in am.
   -Continue Sildenafil TID
   -Hep gtt for possible PE (increased risk given PAH)
   -ROMI
   -check CD4 count
   -LDH
   -LFTs
   # Pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **] HTN: Difficult treating.  Presumed due to HIV and
   dCHF.  Has not been able to tolerate sildenafil as getting ""drunk""
   feelings.  Per recent notes from end of 09 patient seems to be getting
   worse.
   -D/w attending further treatment for PAH, Flolan or other inhailed
   vasodilator.
   -Continue Sildenafil
   -O2 as needed
   -CPAP overnight
   -Consider dig.
   -Assess for pulmonary rehab.
   # Hyperkalemia: K often runs in upper 5s and occasionally lower 6.
   Currently is elevated.  S/p Ca in ED and Kayexelate.  No ECG changes.
   Likely related to renal disase.
   -Kayxelate
   -ECG in am
   -Low K diet.
   # dCHF: Presumed based on Echo and R heart cath.  LV EF preserved and
   hyperdynamic.  Elevated E wave acceleration time.  Unclear if currently
   worse given normal BNP and lack of true desaturation.  Do not suspect
   that dCHF is causing large component of DOE at this time.
   -Holding lasix given sensative preload with PAH and recent hypotensive
   episode.
   # HIV:  Last CD4 count in [**2-17**] was 384.  Patient currently on ARVT.
   -Continue ARV while in house.
   -Check CD4 count, if low consider oportunistic infections.
   # Anemia: Currently stable.  Attributable to HIV and multiple medical
   illenss.
   -Trend hct
   -Transfuse if < 21
   # OSA: Patient with history of noncompliance of CPAP in past, currently
   tolerating it well.  CPAP seems to improve his breathing.
   -CPAP at night
   # Acute renal failre: [**Month (only) 51**] be in setting of increase diuresis.  Recieved
   some fluid in ED.  Will hold am lasix and trend Cr.
   -F/u cr.  If worsening will send urine lytes.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 year old male with a history of long-standing HIV on
   HAART, pulmonary hypertension, HCV (s/p successful interferon), stage
   IV cirrhosis, dCHF, morbid obesity, DM, OSA, renal insufficiency and
   previous hyperkalemia, who presents to the ED with weight gain, chills,
   dyspnea and increasing edema, ARF. Today he endorses headache and
   myalgia.
   # Dyspnea
   Likely multifactorial and numerous possibilities including typical and
   atypical pneumonias, pulmonary hypertension, fluid overload, pulmonary
   embolism. Fluid overload and exacerabation of CHF not supported by BNP.
   Crackles in this context would be unimpressive given pulmonary
   hypertension (as we see today, with few crackles). Infection possible
   given malaise, chills, will therefore send nasopharyngeal swab for flu.
   Await CD4 to determine DDx for organisms. Concerns are for worsening
   pulmonary artery hypertension, although again without evidence of
   raised BNP. PE possible, but pressures good and again. This is low
   suspicion given subacute presentation and present improvement.  Patient
   has been afebrile. He is likely feeling more comfortable because of O2
   therapy. WBC is not elevated, but will need to see were HIV activity is
   before difinitive. Unlikely to be CAD or anginal equvalent. Patient
   endorses quite some fluid overload.
   - Given stability and increased weight, will diurese and evaluate
   effect.
   - Continue Sildenafil TID
   - Hep gtt for possible PE (increased risk given PAH)
   - Check LENIs as proxy for CTA given renal function and low likelihood
   - Await cell counts (CD4)
   - Echo
   - Lasix drip to 50 cc/hr out minimum
   # Pulmonary Arterial HTN
   Difficult treating.  Presumed due to HIV and dCHF. Has not been able to
   tolerate sildenafil as getting ""drunk"" feelings.  Per recent notes from
   end of 09 patient seems to be getting worse.
   - D/w outpatient Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 9749**] treatment for PAH, Flolan or other
   inhailed vasodilator.
   - Continue Sildenafil in this setting
   - O2 as needed
   - CPAP overnight
   - Consider dig.
   - Echo
   - Assess for pulmonary rehab.
   # Hyperkalemia
   K often runs in upper 5s and occasionally lower 6.  Per patient, this
   correlates with renal failure. Somewhat surprising elevation given
   level of renal failure. On ACEI which may also contribute. Possible
   heparin effect.
   - Control with polystyrene today, then more HD on Renal
s advice
   - Low K diet
   # HCV/Liver failure
   Liver failure may also have resulted in some relatively opaque ascites
   in this patient that may account for some weight gain, malaise.
   Therefore also possible SBP. This would also be consistent with pleural
   effusion
 mild effusion is seen.
   - Bedside ultrasound
   - Diuresis
   # dCHF
   Presumed based on Echo and R heart cath.  Unclear if currently worse
   given normal BNP and lack of true desaturation.  Do not suspect that
   dCHF is causing large component of DOE at this time. Nonetheless,
   weight gain is likely fluid. Will trial diuresis.
   - Lasix drip
   # HIV
   Last CD4 count in [**2-17**] was 384.  Patient currently on ARVT. Patient
   was
long term survivor
 off treatment. Likely CD4 count okay, but need
   to evaluate before narrowing differentials for possible pulmonary
   process.
   - Continue ARV while in house
   - Await CD4 count
   # Anemia, near-leucopenia
   Currently stable.  Attributable to HIV and multiple medical illnesses.
   -Trend hct
   -Transfuse if < 21
   # OSA
   Patient with history of noncompliance of CPAP in past, currently
   tolerating it well.  CPAP seems to improve his breathing.
   -CPAP at night
   # Acute renal failre
   Concern for poor renal perfusion given possible fluid overload (BNP
   does not support) versus over-diuresis with recent increase in Lasix at
   home. Will trend Cr and trial diuresis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of long-standing HIV on HAART, pulmonary hypertension, HCV (successful interferon treatment), stage IV cirrhosis, dCHF, morbid obesity, DM, OSA, renal insufficiency, and previous hyperkalemia. He presents to the ED with weight gain, chills, dyspnea, and increasing edema. He also endorses headache and myalgia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea may be multifactorial and could be caused by typical or atypical pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, fluid overload, or pulmonary embolism. The BNP is not consistent with fluid overload, and crackles are minimal due to pulmonary hypertension. Infection is possible, so a nasopharyngeal swab for flu is sent. The patient's improvement with O2 therapy suggests that worsening pulmonary artery hypertension or PE is less likely.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, which may be related to renal failure. His K levels are elevated, and he is on ACEI, which may contribute to this condition. Possible heparin effect is also considered.
3. Liver failure: The patient has stage IV cirrhosis, and his liver failure may result in opaque ascites and possible SBP. A bedside ultrasound is recommended to evaluate this further.
4. dCHF: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 year old male with a history of long-standing HIV on
   HAART, pulmonary hypertension, HCV (s/p successful interferon), stage
   IV cirrhosis, dCHF, morbid obesity, DM, OSA, renal insufficiency and
   previous hyperkalemia, who presents to the ED with weight gain, chills,
   dyspnea and increasing edema, ARF. Today he endorses headache and
   myalgia.
   Overall, major contributors to his present condition are weight gain
   secondary to both increased ascites (cardiogenic and hepatic),
   pulmonary hypertension and renal failure. BNP and signs of volume
   overload are not marked, and venous pressure is slightly up. Therefore
   likely some increased interstitial fluid/intravascular fluid, with a
   possible large contribution from ascites. This accounts for weight gain
   and some increased difficulty walking before the admission. Pulmonary
   hypertension and resulting fixed cardiac output with slight fluid
   overload are likely contributors to dyspnea, which is recovering well
   with oxygen, Lasix drip. We need to also be mindful of HIV as a cause
   of pulmonary hypertension and also for atypical infections. We still
   await T cell counts.
   # Dyspnea
   Likely multifactorial as mentioned. Pneumonia seems less likely now
   given no constitutional signs of infection. Pulmonary hypertension,
   slight fluid overload are most likely, while we are mindful of unlikely
   pulmonary embolism (given rapid recovery and likely little reserve
   given his underlying physiology). Flu swab is negative and there is
   little concern for CAP.
   - Convert diuresis to bolus for move to floor
   - Continue Sildenafil TID and talk to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] further about this
   - Hep gtt for possible PE (increased risk given PAH)
   - Await read of echo
   - Check LENIs as proxy for CTA given renal function and low likelihood
   - Await cell counts (CD4)
   - Stop azithromycin, do not start Tamiflu
   # Pulmonary Arterial HTN
   Difficult treating.  Presumed due to HIV and dCHF. Has not been able to
   tolerate sildenafil as getting ""drunk"" feelings.  Per recent notes from
   end of 09 patient seems to be getting worse.
   - Await echo
   - D/w outpatient Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 9749**] treatment for PAH, Flolan or other
   inhailed vasodilator.
   - Continue Sildenafil in this setting
   - O2 as needed
   - CPAP overnight
   # Hyperkalemia
   Is improved now renal function and acid-base improved. Further HD not
   likely needed at this time.
   - Remove HD line today
   - Low K diet
   # HCV/Liver failure
   Liver failure may also have resulted in some relatively opaque ascites

   # dCHF
   Presumed based on Echo and R heart cath.  Unclear if currently worse
   given normal BNP and lack of true desaturation.  Do not suspect that

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of long-standing HIV on HAART, pulmonary hypertension, HCV (successful interferon treatment), stage IV cirrhosis, dCHF, morbid obesity, DM, OSA, renal insufficiency, and previous hyperkalemia. He presents to the ED with weight gain, chills, dyspnea, and increasing edema. He also endorses headache and myalgia.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which can contribute to dyspnea.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has presumed dCHF based on echo and R heart cath. However, his BNP is not consistent with fluid overload, and there is no true desaturation. Weight gain may be due to increased ascites, pulmonary hypertension, and renal failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to poor renal perfusion caused by fluid overload or over-diuresis.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's previous hyperkalemia has improved now that renal function and acid-base balance have improved.
5. HCV/Liver Failure: Liver failure may result in some relatively opaque ascites, which could account for weight gain and malaise.
6. HIV: The patient's HIV status needs to be evaluated, especially considering his low CD4 count and potential for at"

   This is a 58 year old male with a history of long-standing HIV on
   HAART, pulmonary hypertension, HCV (s/p successful interferon), stage
   IV cirrhosis, dCHF, morbid obesity, DM, OSA, renal insufficiency and
   previous hyperkalemia, who presents to the ED with weight gain, chills,
   dyspnea and increasing edema, ARF. Today he endorses headache and
   myalgia.
   # Dyspnea
   Likely multifactorial and numerous possibilities including typical and
   atypical pneumonias, pulmonary hypertension, fluid overload, pulmonary
   embolism. Fluid overload and exacerabation of CHF not supported by BNP.
   Crackles in this context would be unimpressive given pulmonary
   hypertension (as we see today, with few crackles). Infection possible
   given malaise, chills, will therefore send nasopharyngeal swab for flu.
   Await CD4 to determine DDx for organisms. Concerns are for worsening
   pulmonary artery hypertension, although again without evidence of
   raised BNP. PE possible, but pressures good and again. This is low
   suspicion given subacute presentation and present improvement.  Patient
   has been afebrile. He is likely feeling more comfortable because of O2
   therapy. WBC is not elevated, but will need to see were HIV activity is
   before difinitive. Unlikely to be CAD or anginal equvalent. Patient
   endorses quite some fluid overload.
   - Given stability and increased weight, will diurese and evaluate
   effect.
   - Continue Sildenafil TID
   - Hep gtt for possible PE (increased risk given PAH)
   - Check LENIs as proxy for CTA given renal function and low likelihood
   - Await cell counts (CD4)
   - Echo
   - Lasix drip to 50 cc/hr out minimum
   # Pulmonary Arterial HTN
   Difficult treating.  Presumed due to HIV and dCHF. Has not been able to
   tolerate sildenafil as getting ""drunk"" feelings.  Per recent notes from
   end of 09 patient seems to be getting worse.
   - D/w outpatient Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 9749**] treatment for PAH, Flolan or other
   inhailed vasodilator.
   - Continue Sildenafil in this setting
   - O2 as needed
   - CPAP overnight
   - Consider dig.
   - Echo
   - Assess for pulmonary rehab.
   # Hyperkalemia
   K often runs in upper 5s and occasionally lower 6.  Per patient, this
   correlates with renal failure. Somewhat surprising elevation given
   level of renal failure. On ACEI which may also contribute. Possible
   heparin effect.
   - Control with polystyrene today, then more HD on Renal
s advice
   - Low K diet
   # HCV/Liver failure
   Liver failure may also have resulted in some relatively opaque ascites
   in this patient that may account for some weight gain, malaise.
   Therefore also possible SBP. This would also be consistent with pleural
   effusion
 mild effusion is seen.
   - Bedside ultrasound
   - Diuresis
   # dCHF
   Presumed based on Echo and R heart cath.  Unclear if currently worse
   given normal BNP and lack of true desaturation.  Do not suspect that
   dCHF is causing large component of DOE at this time. Nonetheless,
   weight gain is likely fluid. Will trial diuresis.
