   Head CT wnl
   -transfusing 2 U PRBCs for Hct 21.6, received lasix in between units.
   -HR came down to 80s, still in a fib.  Stopped dilt and transitioned IV
   metoprolol --> HR went back up and changed back to dilt drip.  Pt
   extremely agitated whenever urinating with increased HR up to 180s
   (looked like flutter).  Required extra ativan, with lopressor 5 mg IV
   push, then HR came down. (this happened 3 times).
   -Also noticed maculopapular rash on back when agitated -> maybe drug
   rash?
   -this am, morphology of rhythm looked different on tele monitor, got
   ecg and did not look significantly different from prior, except maybe
   more significant TWI in V3.

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.
   #. Tachycardia:
   Per cardiology read of EKG on admission to the ICU, patient's curent
   rhythm is atypical atrial flutter with variable conduction to
   ventricles. She has certainly had atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier
   in her hospital course. Possible that her recent episodes of atrial
   fib/flutter are due to or exacerbated by volume overload. Current
   evidence of overload is pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, JVP
   elevation, increasing weight. Complicating her tachycardia is her
   fever, which was as high as 102.1 early this AM. Regarding long-term
   managment of atrial fib/flutter, her CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension) and she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation, though platelet count of 12 precludes that currently.
   - Diltiazem drip
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Diueresis given her clinical exam consistent with volume overload and
   her pulmonary edema per recent CT scan
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient reportedly withdrawing compared to
   prior interactions with healthcare teams. Concerning that her mental
   status changes are coming in setting of PLT count of 14 and 12 in last
   two days. Additional consideration that patient is having febrile
   neutropenia and encephalitis or meningitis could be contributing.
   - STAT head CT
   - Follow-up PLT count
   - Increase cefepime to Q8H and increase daptomycin to 6 mg/kg for
   additional CNS coverage
   - Consider MRI if ongoing concern for infectious etiologies of AMS
   - Consider neurology consult if no clearing of mental status
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with new oxygen requirement in the last few days. Currently
   mid-90s on 3L NC. Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and
   bilbasilar crackles. Possible that hypoxia is all due to pulmonary
   edema from poor LV filling in setting of LVH and tachycardia.
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Trend supplemental oxygen requirement with diuersis and resolution of
   tachycardia as above
   - CXR to assess for any focal consolidation
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +6.
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:
   Patient's ANC this AM was 5. Tmax in last 24 hours was 102.1 at 0100
   today. Prior to transfer to ICU, temperature was down to 99.9.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 5), cefepime (currently day 8),
   daptomycin (currently day 4), acyclovir (currently day 9)
   #. VRE UTI:
   Urine culture positive from [**2112-1-23**]. Sensitive to linezolid;
   however, BMT did not want to use linezolid due to marrow suppression.
   Daptomycin was started on [**2112-1-26**] and daptomycin sensitivies are
   pending.
   - ID consult input appreciated
   - Continue daptomycin (currently day 4)
   - Await urine culture sensitivities for daptomycin
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   Patient received a bag of platelets this AM for PLT count of 12.
   - Post-transfusion PLT count
   - Trend PLTs
   #. Hypertension:
   End-organ damage given LVH on EKGs. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - Additional diuresis as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine if blood pressure
   greater than 150s systolic while on diltiazem drip
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Regular low bacteria diet as allowed by her mucositis, TPN
   w/ Lipids - [**2112-1-28**] 10:49 AM 65 mL/hour
   Glycemic Control: [**Hospital1 7**] FSBS with HISS
   Lines: Tunneled (Hickman) Line - [**2112-1-28**] 10:50 AM
   Prophylaxis:
   - DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   - Bowel regimen will be added as needed
   - Pain management with PRN morphine IV

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU for now while requiring diltiazem drip for control of
   atrial fib/flutter
","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, presenting to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s this morning.
- She has had multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response earlier in her hospital course.
- Possible that her recent episodes of atrial fib/flutter are due to or exacerbated by volume overload.
- Current evidence of overload includes pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, JVP elevation, and increasing weight.
- She also has a fever, which was as high as 102.1 early this morning.
- Her CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), and she will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation, though her platelet count of 12 precludes that currently.
- She is currently on diltiazem drip, and her fever is being controlled as much as possible.
- Diuretics are being given due to her clinical exam consistent with volume overload and her pulmonary edema per recent CT scan.
- Daily weights are being appreciated, and cardiology input is being awaited.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tachycardia:
- The patient's current rhythm is atypical atrial flutter with variable conduction to the ventricles.
- She has certainly had atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in her hospital course.
- Possible that her recent episodes of atrial fib/flutter are due to or exacerbated"

   Disposition: ICU for now while requiring diltiazem drip for control of
   atrial fib/flutter
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma presenting to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response earlier in the hospital course. The patient's current rhythm is atypical atrial flutter with variable conduction to the ventricles. She has also had atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in her hospital course.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has evidence of volume overload, including pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, JVP elevation, and increasing weight. This can lead to respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has had multiple episodes of AFib with RVR, which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is further complicated by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on EKGs. This can lead to end-organ damage if not controlled.
4. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient is withdrawing and experiencing mental status changes, which could be due to several factors such as febrile neutropenia, encephalitis, meningitis, or medication effects.
5. Hypoxia: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has coarse"

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EDEMA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient reportedly withdrawing compared to
   prior interactions with healthcare teams. Additional consideration that
   patient is having febrile neutropenia and encephalitis or meningitis
   could be contributing.  CT head was normal, without evidence of bleed.
   Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so we have been intermittently
   using morphine, ativan and haldol to calm her.  She is nearly
   non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain.
   - PRN haldol for now, if working well/using regularly, can switch to
   standing dose.
   - Increase cefepime to Q8H and increase daptomycin to 6 mg/kg for
   additional CNS coverage
   - Consider MRI if ongoing concern for infectious etiologies of AMS
   - Continue PRN ativan and morphine.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider daptomycin as contributing to delirium.
   #. Tachycardia:
   Today appears to be in Afib with RVR. Possible that her recent episodes
   of atrial fib/flutter are due to or exacerbated by volume overload.
   Current evidence of overload is pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, JVP
   elevation, increasing weight. Complicating her tachycardia is continued
   fever.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she will
   eventually require consideration for anticoagulation, though platelet
   count of 12 precludes that currently.
   - Continue diltiazem drip w/ PRN lopressor when not controlled.
   - Consider amiodarone or digoxin.  Amiodarone would likely be more
   effective, but may cause cardioversion and it is impossible to know
   without a TEE or prolonged anticoagulation whether he has a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5624**].  Digoxin may be more realistic at this point.
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Continue diuresis as creatinine allows.
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with new oxygen requirement in the last few days. Currently
   mid-90s on 3L NC. Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and
   bilbasilar crackles. Possible that hypoxia is all due to pulmonary
   edema from poor LV filling in setting of LVH and tachycardia.  This
   hypothesis supported by worsening hypoxia when tachy to 150s.
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Diuresis as creatinine allows.
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +7.  Will likely nadir until days [**12-19**].
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:
   Patient's ANC now 0. Patient persistently febrile on micafungin,
   cefepime, daptomycin and acyclovir.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 5), cefepime (currently day 8),
   daptomycin (currently day 4), acyclovir (currently day 9)
   #. VRE UTI:
   Urine culture positive from [**2112-1-23**]. Sensitive to linezolid;
   however, BMT did not want to use linezolid due to marrow suppression.
   Daptomycin sensitive, so dapto started on [**2112-1-26**].
   - ID consult input appreciated
   - Continue daptomycin (currently day 4)
   - Await urine culture sensitivities for daptomycin
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - Additional diuresis as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient reportedly withdrawing compared to
   prior interactions with healthcare teams. Additional consideration that
   patient is having febrile neutropenia and encephalitis or meningitis
   could be contributing.  CT head was normal, without evidence of bleed.
   Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so we have been intermittently
   using morphine, ativan and haldol to calm her.  She is nearly
   non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain.
   - PRN haldol for now, if working well/using regularly, can switch to
   standing dose.
   - Increase cefepime to Q8H and increase daptomycin to 6 mg/kg for
   additional CNS coverage
   - Consider MRI if ongoing concern for infectious etiologies of AMS
   - Continue PRN ativan and morphine.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider daptomycin as contributing to delirium.
   #. Tachycardia:
   Today appears to be in Afib with RVR. Possible that her recent episodes
   of atrial fib/flutter are due to or exacerbated by volume overload.
   Current evidence of overload is pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, JVP
   elevation, increasing weight. Complicating her tachycardia is continued
   fever.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she will
   eventually require consideration for anticoagulation, though platelet
   count of 12 precludes that currently.
   - Continue diltiazem drip w/ PRN lopressor when not controlled.
   - Consider amiodarone or digoxin.  Amiodarone would likely be more
   effective, but may cause cardioversion and it is impossible to know
   without a TEE or prolonged anticoagulation whether he has a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5624**].  Digoxin may be more realistic at this point.
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Continue diuresis as creatinine allows.
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with new oxygen requirement in the last few days. Currently
   mid-90s on 3L NC. Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and
   bilbasilar crackles. Possible that hypoxia is all due to pulmonary
   edema from poor LV filling in setting of LVH and tachycardia.  This
   hypothesis supported by worsening hypoxia when tachy to 150s.
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Diuresis as creatinine allows.
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +7.  Will likely nadir until days [**12-19**].
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:
   Patient's ANC now 0. Patient persistently febrile on micafungin,
   cefepime, daptomycin and acyclovir.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 5), cefepime (currently day 8),
   daptomycin (currently day 4), acyclovir (currently day 9)
   #. VRE UTI:
   Urine culture positive from [**2112-1-23**]. Sensitive to linezolid;
   however, BMT did not want to use linezolid due to marrow suppression.
   Daptomycin sensitive, so dapto started on [**2112-1-26**].
   - ID consult input appreciated
   - Continue daptomycin (currently day 4)
   - Await urine culture sensitivities for daptomycin
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - Additional diuresis as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled

","Summary:
- The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, presenting to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
- She has altered mental status, which is most consistent with delirium, but there are concerns for possible CNS infection. The patient reportedly withdrawing compared to prior interactions with healthcare teams.
- Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so she has been intermittently using morphine, ativan, and haldol to calm her.
- She is nearly non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain.
- There are concerns about pulmonary edema, hypertension, hypoxia, febrile neutropenia, VRE UTI, and multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or underlying medical conditions.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with RVR and current tachycardia to 180s suggests a high risk for further cardiac arrhythmias. These can lead to complications like heart failure or stroke.
3. Hypotension: Given the patient's hypertension and the use of diuretics, there is a risk of developing hypotension, which can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the hospital for an auto-SCT (stem cell transplant) complicated by febrile neutropenia, VRE UTI (vancomycin-resistant enterococci urinary tract infection), AMS (acute mental status changes), and mucositis. She was transferred for rapid atrial fibrillation and pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of allergies to Percocet (Oxycodone/Acetaminophen), Ciprofloxacin, Oxycodone, and hallucinations. She is currently on multiple medications including diltiazem, hydralazine, meperidine, furosemide, metoprolol, pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, haloperidol, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rapid atrial fibrillation: The patient's rapid atrial fibrillation remains uncontrolled despite diltiazem infusion. The plan is to convert back to oral beta-blocker and control agitation with pain medications and Haldol.
2. Altered mental status: The patient has AMS with some component of delirium. Haldol has been started based on prn needs.
3. Febrile neutropenia: The patient's febrile neutropenia is being covered with cefipime, daptomycin, and micafungin. Further management will be discussed with the BMT/cards team,"

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient reportedly withdrawing compared to
   prior interactions with healthcare teams. Additional consideration that
   patient is having febrile neutropenia and encephalitis or meningitis
   could be contributing.  CT head was normal, without evidence of bleed.
   Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so we have been intermittently
   using morphine, ativan and haldol to calm her.  She is nearly
   non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain.
   - PRN haldol for now, if working well/using regularly, can switch to
   standing dose.
   - Increase cefepime to Q8H and increase daptomycin to 6 mg/kg for
   additional CNS coverage
   - Consider MRI if ongoing concern for infectious etiologies of AMS
   - Continue PRN ativan and morphine.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider daptomycin as contributing to delirium.
   #. Tachycardia:
   Today appears to be in Afib with RVR. Possible that her recent episodes
   of atrial fib/flutter are due to or exacerbated by volume overload.
   Current evidence of overload is pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, JVP
   elevation, increasing weight. Complicating her tachycardia is continued
   fever.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she will
   eventually require consideration for anticoagulation, though platelet
   count of 12 precludes that currently.
   - Continue diltiazem drip w/ PRN lopressor when not controlled.
   - Consider amiodarone or digoxin.  Amiodarone would likely be more
   effective, but may cause cardioversion and it is impossible to know
   without a TEE or prolonged anticoagulation whether he has a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5624**].  Digoxin may be more realistic at this point.
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Continue diuresis as creatinine allows.
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with new oxygen requirement in the last few days. Currently
   mid-90s on 3L NC. Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and
   bilbasilar crackles. Possible that hypoxia is all due to pulmonary
   edema from poor LV filling in setting of LVH and tachycardia.  This
   hypothesis supported by worsening hypoxia when tachy to 150s.
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Diuresis as creatinine allows.
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +7.  Will likely nadir until days [**12-19**].
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:
   Patient's ANC now 0. Patient persistently febrile on micafungin,
   cefepime, daptomycin and acyclovir.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 5), cefepime (currently day 8),
   daptomycin (currently day 4), acyclovir (currently day 9)
   #. VRE UTI:
   Urine culture positive from [**2112-1-23**]. Sensitive to linezolid;
   however, BMT did not want to use linezolid due to marrow suppression.
   Daptomycin sensitive, so dapto started on [**2112-1-26**].
   - ID consult input appreciated
   - Continue daptomycin (currently day 4)
   - Await urine culture sensitivities for daptomycin
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - Additional diuresis as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled

   Disposition: ICU for now while febrile and altered
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She is currently in the ICU with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, febrile neutropenia, altered mental status, and pulmonary edema. The patient underwent stem cell transplantation on day +7 and is expected to have a nadir until days 12-19. She also has a urinary tract infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be consistent with delirium, but there is a concern for possible CNS infection due to her febrile neutropenia. Further evaluation is needed, and an MRI may be considered if there is ongoing concern for infectious etiologies of altered mental status (AMS).

2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia appears to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Possible causes include volume overload and fever. Efforts should be made to control her heart rate and blood pressure, and consideration should be given to anticoagulation once her platelet count improves.

3. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which may be related to pulmonary edema. Controlling her heart rate and blood pressure, as well as continuing diuresis as creatinine allows, are important management strategies.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite
   treatment with broad-spectrum abx.  Cannot give Tylenol PO or PR.
   Toradol worked but has renal toxicity.  Only using cooling blanket at
   this point.  UTI VRE is daptomycin sensitive, so unlikely to be source
   - Culture once daily while spiking.
   - Give Demerol for rigors, using sparingly given low GFR.
   - Continue dapto/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/micafungin/acyclovir for antibiotic coverage.
   - Consider LP to find source.
   - Consider intubation to allow for further work-up (bronchoscopy, CT
   scan, LP, etc.)
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient  is febrile and neutropenic, so
   encephalitis or meningitis could be contributing.   Her mental status
   is worsening.  CT head was normal, without evidence of bleed, despite
   her thrombocytopenia.  Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so we have
   been intermittently using morphine, ativan and haldol to calm her.  She
   is nearly non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain.
   - Would like to do LP, but patient would likely need intubation for
   procedure.  Will discuss with oncology and family.
   - Will keep antibiotics at doses for CNS penetration.
   - PRN haldol for now, if working well/using regularly, can switch to
   standing dose.
   - Consider MRI if ongoing concern for infectious etiologies of AMS
   - Continue PRN ativan and morphine.
   - Daptomycin unlikely cause of delirium.
   - platelets trending down, give 1 unit to avoid head bleed.
   #. Tachycardia:
   Today appears to be in Afib with RVR. We thought her tachycardia was
   exacerbated by volume overload, though today she appears dry and
   remains tachy with a cloudy CXR.  Complicating her tachycardia is
   continued fever.  Will continue dilt drip with PRN lopressor and also
   load with digoxin.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation, though
   platelet count of 12 precludes that currently.
   - Continue diltiazem drip w/ PRN lopressor when not controlled.
   - Start dig load.
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Hold off on diuresis for today given hyponatremia and rising
   creatinine.  Do not give back fluid given tenuous respiratory status.
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with new oxygen requirement in the last few days. Currently
   mid-90s on 3L NC. Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and
   bilbasilar crackles. Possible that hypoxia is all due to pulmonary
   edema from poor LV filling in setting of LVH and tachycardia.  Diuresis
   has been limited by hyponatremia and rising Cr.  This hypothesis
   supported by worsening hypoxia when tachy to 150s.
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Diuresis as creatinine allows.
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +8.  Will likely nadir until days [**12-19**].
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:
   Patient's ANC now 0. Patient persistently febrile on micafungin,
   meropenem, daptomycin and acyclovir.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 6), cefepime/meropenem (currently
   day 8+1), daptomycin (currently day 5), acyclovir (currently day 10)
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - Additional diuresis as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Regular low bacteria diet as allowed by her mucositis, TPN

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who presents to the ICU with tachycardia, altered mental status, febrile neutropenia, and respiratory distress. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals for suspected infections. The patient's condition has been complicated by atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, and hypoxia. She has a low white blood cell count and is neutropenic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient's persistent fever and neutropenia indicate an increased risk of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the source of infection remains unclear. Further investigations, such as a lumbar puncture (LP), may be necessary to identify the cause.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is worsening, which could be due to delirium or an infectious etiology. Immediate steps include controlling fever, providing supportive care, and considering an LP to rule out central nervous system (CNS) infection.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia appears to be multifactorial, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and fever. It is important to control her heart rate and consider anticoagulation when her platelet count improves.

4. Hypoxia: The patient"

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient reportedly withdrawing compared to
   prior interactions with healthcare teams. Additional consideration that
   patient is having febrile neutropenia and encephalitis or meningitis
   could be contributing.  CT head was normal, without evidence of bleed.
   Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so we have been intermittently
   using morphine, ativan and haldol to calm her.  She is nearly
   non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain.
   - PRN haldol for now, if working well/using regularly, can switch to
   standing dose.
   - Increase cefepime to Q8H and increase daptomycin to 6 mg/kg for
   additional CNS coverage
   - Consider MRI if ongoing concern for infectious etiologies of AMS
   - Continue PRN ativan and morphine.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider daptomycin as contributing to delirium.
   #. Tachycardia:
   Today appears to be in Afib with RVR. Possible that her recent episodes
   of atrial fib/flutter are due to or exacerbated by volume overload.
   Current evidence of overload is pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, JVP
   elevation, increasing weight. Complicating her tachycardia is continued
   fever.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she will
   eventually require consideration for anticoagulation, though platelet
   count of 12 precludes that currently.
   - Continue diltiazem drip w/ PRN lopressor when not controlled.
   - Consider amiodarone or digoxin.  Amiodarone would likely be more
   effective, but may cause cardioversion and it is impossible to know
   without a TEE or prolonged anticoagulation whether he has a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5624**].  Digoxin may be more realistic at this point.
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Continue diuresis as creatinine allows.
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with new oxygen requirement in the last few days. Currently
   mid-90s on 3L NC. Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and
   bilbasilar crackles. Possible that hypoxia is all due to pulmonary
   edema from poor LV filling in setting of LVH and tachycardia.  This
   hypothesis supported by worsening hypoxia when tachy to 150s.
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Diuresis as creatinine allows.
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +7.  Will likely nadir until days [**12-19**].
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:
   Patient's ANC now 0. Patient persistently febrile on micafungin,
   cefepime, daptomycin and acyclovir.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 5), cefepime (currently day 8),
   daptomycin (currently day 4), acyclovir (currently day 9)
   #. VRE UTI:
   Urine culture positive from [**2112-1-23**]. Sensitive to linezolid;
   however, BMT did not want to use linezolid due to marrow suppression.
   Daptomycin sensitive, so dapto started on [**2112-1-26**].
   - ID consult input appreciated
   - Continue daptomycin (currently day 4)
   - Await urine culture sensitivities for daptomycin
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - Additional diuresis as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled

She is febrile with a temperature of 103.6°F and her white blood cell count is low at 0.1 K/uL. Her platelet count is also low at 15 K/uL.

Her current medications include diltiazem, furosemide (Lasix), lorazepam (Ativan), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), meperidine (Demerol), and haloperidol (Haldol). She has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently in AF with RVR. 

Her recent lab results show a sodium level of 120 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, and chloride level of 98 mEq/L. Her BUN is elevated at 36 mg/dL, creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, and glucose is 124 mg/dL. Her WBC count is 0.1 K/uL, HCT is 21.6%, and PLT is 49 K/uL.

Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions, possibly increased on the right, and a cardiac silhouette likely unchanged allowing for differences in lung volumes. There are signs of fluid overload similar to the previous day's chest x-ray.

The patient's urine culture is positive for a VRE UTI, which is sensitive to linezolid. However, the BMT team does not want to use linezolid due to marrow suppression. Daptomycin is sensitive, so it has been started. The patient's blood cultures are negative for growth.

The patient's recent vital signs include a temperature of 103.6°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 126/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 3L NC."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old female with multiple myeloma who underwent an auto-SCT (autologous stem cell transplant). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress, which may be due to pulmonary edema/pleural effusion aggravated by rapid atrial fibrillation (afib) and sepsis. Intubation and rate control of afib may be necessary.
2. Neutropenic fever: The patient has febrile neutropenia and is currently on acyclovir, daptomycin, and cefipime. Further evaluation and discussion with the ID (infectious disease) team is needed to determine if additional antifungal or listeria treatment is required.
3. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's AMS represents delirium, pain, and sepsis. A head CT after intubation should be performed to rule out a bleed, and a lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered assuming the head CT is negative.
4. Atrial fibrillation (afib): The patient has persistent afib, and current medications include diltiazem and metoprolol. Digoxin will also be added for rate control.
5. Multiple myeloma (MM): The patient's MM"

   ID came by and asked for a whole slew of labs (especially for CSF

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma (cancer) who is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, discomfort, and agitation, leading to intubation.

The patient has been experiencing fever with no clear source of infection. Invasive ventilation was started on [**2112-1-30**] at 12:46 PM, and a bronchoscopy was performed the same day at 01:35 PM. The patient underwent an MRI head and a CT abdomen and pelvis, but the results are still pending.

The patient has allergies to Percocet (oral), which causes nausea/vomiting; ciprofloxacin, resulting in a rash; and oxycodone, leading to hallucinations. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefipime on [**2112-1-29**] at 10:00 AM, azithromycin on [**2112-1-30**] at 05:15 PM, daptomycin on [**2112-1-30**] at 05:27 PM, acyclovir on [**2112-1-30**] at 08:03 PM, micafungin on [**2112-1-30**] at 09:04 PM, meropenem on [**2112-1-30**] at 11:01 PM, and clindamycin on [**2112-1-31**] at 03:07 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (Versed), along with other ICU medications. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Flowsheet data as of [**2112-1-31**] 07:33 AM shows the patient's vital signs with a maximum temperature of 39.2 C (102.6 F), current temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate (HR) of 108 bpm with a range of 92-141 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 111/54 mmHg to 152/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute with a range of 13-46 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF) and has a current weight of 70.2 kg, with an admission weight of 65.5 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,302 mL, including 475 mL of PO and 1,139 mL of IVF, with a total output of 595 mL. The patient remains neutropenic, but the counts are expected to rise in the next"

   CXR this AM
   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   No intubated to facilitate procedures given continued
   agitation in setting of fevers and likely bacteremia.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite
   treatment with broad-spectrum abx.  Cannot give Tylenol PO or PR.
   Toradol worked but has renal toxicity.  Only using cooling blanket at
   this point.  UTI VRE is daptomycin sensitive, so unlikely to be source
   - Culture once daily while spiking.
   - Give Demerol for rigors, using sparingly given low GFR.
   - Continue [**Month/Year (2) 8023**]/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/micafungin/acyclovir for antibiotic coverage.
   Now also with azithromycin, primaquin and clinda per ID
   - Consider LP today if able to get platelets > 50K.
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient  is febrile and neutropenic, so
   encephalitis or meningitis could be contributing.   Her mental status
   is worsening.  CT head was normal, without evidence of bleed, despite
   her thrombocytopenia.  Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so we have
   been intermittently using morphine, ativan and haldol to calm her.  She
   is nearly non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain.
   - LP today as above
   - Will keep antibiotics at doses for CNS penetration.
   - f/u MRI results
   - Daptomycin unlikely cause of delirium.
   #. Tachycardia:
   Today appears to be in Afib with RVR. We thought her tachycardia was
   exacerbated by volume overload, though today she appears dry and
   remains tachy with a cloudy CXR.  Complicating her tachycardia is
   continued fever.  Dig loaded yesterday.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation, though platelet count of 12 precludes that currently.
   - Continue Digoxin.
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Hold off on diuresis for today given hyponatremia and rising
   creatinine.  Do not give back fluid given tenuous respiratory status.
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Hypoxia: Patient with new oxygen requirement in the last few days.
   Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and bilbasilar crackles.
   Possible that hypoxia is all due to pulmonary edema from poor LV
   filling in setting of LVH and tachycardia.  Diuresis has been limited
   by hyponatremia and rising Cr.  This hypothesis supported by worsening
   hypoxia when tachy to 150s.  Patient now intubated with FiO2 60%.
   - wean FiO2; given neutropenia will defer placing a line and follow
   peripheral O2 sat
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Diuresis as creatinine allows.
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +9.  Will likely nadir until days [**12-19**].
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:
   Patient's ANC now 0. Patient persistently febrile on micafungin,
   meropenem, daptomycin and acyclovir, with new abx added yesterday.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 7), cefepime/meropenem (currently
   day 10), daptomycin (currently day 6), acyclovir (currently day 11)
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - Additional diuresis as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation and is currently intubated due to agitation, altered mental status, discomfort, and the need for tests.

The patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her laboratory results show leukopenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). Imaging shows moderate right and small left pleural effusions, relatively symmetric bilateral airspace opacities, small pericardial effusion, and nonspecific mesenteric and perinephric stranding.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Fevers: The patient's persistent high-grade fevers suggest a possible ongoing infection despite antibiotic treatment. This could indicate the need for further investigation and adjustment of the antibiotic regimen.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's worsening mental status is concerning for possible delirium or central nervous system (CNS) infection. Given her febrile and neutropenic state, encephalitis or meningitis could be contributing factors. Further evaluation with a lumbar puncture (LP) is planned if platelets are above 50K.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia appears"

   increased since the prior chest CT.
   2. Relatively symmetric bilateral airspace opacities, perihilar
   predominant, which may reflect infection or pulmonary edema, worse
   since the prior study. Interlobular septal thickening at the lung
   apices indicates pulmonary edema.
   3. Small pericardial effusion.
   4. Nonspecific mesenteric and perinephric stranding. While this could
   relate to an infectious process such as pyelonephritis, or
   pancreatitis, this may be related to a generalized anasarca. Clinical
   correltion with urine analysis and pancreatic enzymes is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated to facilitate procedures given continued
   agitation in setting of fevers and likely infection.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite
   treatment with broad-spectrum abx.  UTI VRE is daptomycin sensitive, so
   unlikely to be source
   - Culture once daily while spiking.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Give Demerol for rigors, using sparingly given low GFR.
   - Continue [**Month/Year (2) 8023**]/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/micafungin/acyclovir for antibiotic coverage.
   Now also with azithromycin, primaquin and clinda per ID
   - Consider LP today if able to get platelets > 50K.
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: Patient with new oxygen requirement in
   the last few days. Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and
   bilbasilar crackles.  Patient now intubated with FiO2 60%.
   - wean FiO2; will get ABG now and use VBGs along with peripheral SaO2
   to wean vent settings
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Diuresis on hold for now given worsening renal failure.
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient  is febrile and neutropenic, so
   encephalitis or meningitis could be contributing.   Her mental status
   is worsening.  CT head was normal, without evidence of bleed, despite
   her thrombocytopenia.  Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so we have
   been intermittently using morphine, ativan and haldol to calm her.  She
   is nearly non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain.
   - LP today as above
   - Will keep antibiotics at doses for CNS penetration.
   - f/u MRI results
   - Daptomycin unlikely cause of delirium.
    .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Most likely pre-renal/ATN from sepsis.
   - will follow I/O and CVP
   - prn fluid boluses for low UOP
   - urine lytes
   - renally dose meds
   - consider renal u/s if persists
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR. We thought her tachycardia was
   exacerbated by volume overload, as well as fever and agitation.  Dig
   loaded yesterday.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation, though
   platelet count of 12 precludes that currently.
   - Continue Digoxin.
   - Add diltiazem PO and titrate up as needed for better rate control
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +9.  Will likely nadir until days [**12-19**].
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:  Patient continues to be neutropenic and
   persistently febrile on micafungin, meropenem, daptomycin and
   acyclovir, with new abx added yesterday.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 7), cefepime/meropenem (currently
   day 10), daptomycin (currently day 6), acyclovir (currently day 11)
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - Hold on diuresis for now as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: TPN on hold for now, will request tube feed recs

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been intubated due to agitation and potential procedures. She has high-grade fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and is suspected to have an infection. She is febrile and neutropenic, making her at risk for CNS infection. Her mental status is worsening, and she may have delirium or encephalitis/meningitis. She has acute renal failure likely due to sepsis, hypertension, and possible volume overload. She has a history of multiple myeloma and recently underwent a stem cell transplant. She is currently on multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This indicates that the infection has not been fully controlled, and further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and is intubated with FiO2 60%. Weaning of FiO2 should be done carefully, and ABG analysis should guide the weaning process.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing worsening mental status, which could be due to delirium or a possible CNS infection"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT). She presents with febrile neutropenia, altered mental status (AMS), and rapid atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. She also has pulmonary edema, hypertension, and pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Opportunistic infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to neutropenia and pancytopenia increases the risk of opportunistic infections. Extensive coverage with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals is being provided, and cultures are pending.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function may be pre-renal or due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sepsis. Close monitoring of intake and output, urine electrolytes, and consideration of renal ultrasound if persistent are recommended.
3. Central nervous system (CNS) infection: Given the patient's AMS and risk of CNS infection, a lumbar puncture (LP) has been planned to rule out CNS infection.
4. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's acute respiratory failure necessitates ongoing mechanical ventilation support. Weaning off FiO2 and adjusting ventilator settings will be important for successful extubation.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant. She is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions, including febrile neutropenia, altered mental status (AMS), rapid atrial fibrillation (AF), acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including a tunneled line, and is receiving multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Opportunistic infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy and stem cell transplant increases the risk of opportunistic infections. Extensive coverage with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals is being provided while awaiting culture results.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which can cause severe lung dysfunction and potentially lead to multiorgan failure.
3. Delirium: The patient's AMS could be a result of sepsis or an underlying CNS infection. Delirium can worsen outcomes in critically ill patients.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's rapid AF and use of digoxin increase the risk of further cardiac arrhythmias. Monitoring and appropriate management are crucial.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is worsening, which may progress to AKI. Close monitoring of fluid balance"

   MRI:
   Multiple small areas of elevated T2 signal within the white
   matter of both cerebral hemispheres and left temporal cortex. In a
   patient of
   this age, these findings could represent prior small vessel infarcts.
   However,
   in view of the history of immunocompromised patient status, an
   underlying
   opportunistic infectious condition cannot be excluded. If a gadolinium-
   enhanced examination is undertaken (provided there are no
   contraindications to
   its performance) the absence of contrast enhancement would favor
   infarction
   over infection. However, this distinction cannot be absolutely rendered
   on
   the basis of contrast enhancement characteristics. See above report re:
   sinus findings.
   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated to facilitate procedures given continued
   agitation in setting of fevers and likely infection.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite
   treatment with broad-spectrum abx.  UTI VRE is daptomycin sensitive, so
   unlikely to be source. CSF does not show clear evidence of infection.
   HSV PCR pending. BAL also unrevealing.
   - Culture once daily while spiking.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Give Demerol for rigors, using sparingly given low GFR.
   - Continue dapto/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/micafungin/acyclovir for antibiotic coverage.
   Now also with azithromycin, primaquin and clinda per ID
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: Patient with new oxygen requirement in
   the last few days. Pulmonary exam with upper airway coarse sounds and
   bilbasilar crackles.  Patient now intubated with FiO2 60%. CT shows
   possible mutlifocal infection, but BAL negative for bacterial cx, viral
   panel, legionella, nocardia, AFB smear, fungi, PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 11083**] pending.
   - wean FiO2
   - Control HR and BP as above
   - Diuresis on hold for now given worsening renal failure.
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, though fevers are concerning for
   possible CNS infection.  Patient  is febrile and neutropenic, so
   encephalitis or meningitis could be contributing.   Her mental status
   is worsening.  CT head was normal, without evidence of bleed, despite
   her thrombocytopenia.  Her agitation drives her tachycardia, so we have
   been intermittently using morphine, ativan and haldol to calm her.  She
   is nearly non-verbal, making it difficult to assess her pain. MRI
   showed small bihemispheric lesions more likely small infarcts but
   cannot rule out infection, as well as sinus disease.
   - LP unrevealing with normal protein and glucose, 0 wbc, HSV PCR
   pending.
   - Will keep antibiotics at doses for CNS penetration.
   - consider further evaluation of sinuses
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Appears pre-renal based on urine electrolytes.
   CVP 8, urine output borderline low.
   - will follow I/O and CVP
   - bolus 500cc NS
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR, exacerbated fever and agitation.
   CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she will eventually
   require consideration for anticoagulation.
   - Continue Digoxin.
   - increase diltiazem PO to 90 QID as tolerated by BP
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +10.  Counts beginning to increase today.
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:  Patient continues to be neutropenic and
   persistently febrile on micafungin, meropenem, daptomycin and
   acyclovir, with new abx added yesterday.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 8), cefepime/meropenem (currently
   day 11), daptomycin (currently day 7), acyclovir (currently day 12)
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - increase diltiazem as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presents to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. The patient is intubated due to continued agitation and likely infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Fevers: The patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This indicates an ongoing infection that needs further evaluation and management.

2. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: The patient has a new oxygen requirement and shows signs of respiratory failure. The CT scan shows possible multifocal infection, but the BAL results are negative for bacterial, viral, Legionella, Nocardia, AFB smear, fungi, and PCP. This suggests the need for additional diagnostic tests or alternative treatment options.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing delirium, which could be consistent with delirium or a possible CNS infection. Given her febrile and neutropenic status, encephalitis or meningitis should be considered. The CT head is normal without evidence of bleed, but an MRI showed small bihemispheric lesions that may represent small infarcts or an underlying opportunistic infection. Further evaluation, including HSV PCR and LP, is pending.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient appears to have pre-renal acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated to facilitate procedures given continued
   agitation in setting of fevers and likely infection.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite
   treatment with broad-spectrum abx.  UTI VRE is daptomycin sensitive, so
   unlikely to be source, on day [**8-18**] of course. CSF does not show
   evidence of infection. HSV PCR pending. BAL also unrevealing, however
   chest CT shows multiple concering areas in chest. Patient also has SC
   line (uncle[**Name (NI) 2037**] what date this was placed). No NGT in place, so sinus
   changes on MRI less likely to be acute.
   - attempt to place PIV and D/C SC line
   - Culture once daily while spiking.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Give Demerol for rigors, using sparingly given low GFR.
   - Continue azithromycin/dapto/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/micafungin/acyclovir for PNA and UTI
   coverage
   - D/C clinda and primaquine since ruled out for toxo and PCP
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure:  Patient now intubated with FiO2 40%,
   decreased from 60%. PSV trial this AM but patient became tachypnic (was
   spiking fever at the time). CT shows possible mutlifocal infection, but
   BAL negative for bacterial cx, viral panel, legionella, nocardia, AFB
   smear, fungi, PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 11083**] pending.
   - repeat PSV trial this PM when afebrile
   - if tachypnic, obtain ABG
   - Control HR and BP as above
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium in setting of infection. MRI showed small
   bihemispheric lesions more likely small infarcts but cannot rule out
   infection, as well as sinus disease.
   - LP unrevealing with normal protein and glucose, 0 wbc, HSV PCR

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who presented to the ICU with tachycardia and episodes of atrial fibrillation. She has been intubated due to agitation and fever. She has been diagnosed with multiple infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sinusitis. The patient has undergone a stem cell transplant and is currently neutropenic. She also has acute renal failure and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This may indicate an ongoing infection or resistance to the current antibiotics.
2. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires supplemental oxygen. There is a concern for multi-focal infection in the lungs, but BAL results have been negative for various pathogens.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is consistent with her infection. An LP has been performed, but results are pending. The patient's medications will be adjusted for better CNS penetration.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is low, and her CVP is within a normal range. Pre-renal causes of renal failure are suspected, but further evaluation is needed.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, exacerbated by fever and agitation. Anticoag"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma admitted
   to the ICU with A-fib with rapid ventricular response following initial
   admission with transplant for multiple myeloma.  This has also been
   complicated by severely altered mental status.  Of note, she has had
   persistent fever through to today and altered mental status which
   persists.  The source of infection is not clear but persistent fevers
   are seen.
   1)       RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-She has had
   worsening multi-focal opacities and with bilteral effusions noted.
   Bronch and BAL without signfiicant organisms found despite extensive
   pannel with CMV pending now.  Initial intubation was in the setting of
   severe alteration of mental status and persistent agitation limiting
   capacity to conduct care.  Now patient limtied by tachpnea and
   tachycardia with PSV trials today.
                          -will move to PSV today
                          -Will check ABG with ventilator wean to guide
   need for mecahnical ventilation
   2)Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Digoxin
   -Diltiazem
   -Will continue to work to control heart rate
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)-LP without any organisms or
   WBC's seen, HSV PCR pending
   -Will have to continue to treat symptomatically but desire wean of
   sedation at this time
   -Will follow up with MRI final [**Location (un) **] and follow LP results to
   conclusion
   -Continue with acyclovir
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)-
   -GCSF
   3)Fever-We have had extensive evaluations without clear sources beyond
   what is perhaps most likely related to pulmonary pathology.  With
   diffuse and broad spectrum antibiotics we have had to cover broad areas
   of possibility.  C. Diff, pancreatitis, acalculous cholecysticis are
   all possible.  Sinusitis

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma admitted to the ICU.
- She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response following a transplant for multiple myeloma.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, with worsening multi-focal opacities and bilateral effusions.
- She has persistent fever and altered mental status.
- The source of infection is not clear, but extensive evaluations have been done without finding a clear source.
- The patient also has hypertension, benign altered mental status (not delirium), multiple myeloma (cancer), and tachycardia/atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, indicated by multi-focal opacities and bilateral effusions. The cause of this failure may be pneumonia, possibly related to pulmonary pathology.

2. Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. It is being treated with digoxin, diltiazem, and other medications to control heart rate.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has persistent altered mental status, which is not delirium. The cause is unknown, and further investigations are pending.

4. Fever: The patient has had persistent fever, which has not been clearly sourced. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been given"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite
   treatment with broad-spectrum abx.  UTI VRE is daptomycin sensitive, so
   unlikely to be source, on day [**9-18**] of course. CSF does not show
   evidence of infection. HSV PCR pending. BAL also unrevealing, however
   chest CT shows multiple concering areas in chest. Patient also has SC
   line (uncle[**Name (NI) 2037**] what date this was placed). No NGT in place, so sinus
   changes on MRI less likely to be acute.
   - attempt to place PIV and D/C SC line
   - Culture once daily while spiking.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Give Demerol for rigors, using sparingly given low GFR.
   - Continue azithromycin/dapto/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/micafungin/acyclovir for PNA and UTI
   coverage
   - D/C clinda and primaquine since ruled out for toxo and PCP
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Respiratory failure:  Patient now intubated with FiO2 40%,
   decreased from 60%. PSV trial this AM but patient became tachypnic (was
   spiking fever at the time). CT shows possible mutlifocal infection, but
   BAL negative for bacterial cx, viral panel, legionella, nocardia, AFB
   smear, fungi, PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 11083**] pending.
   - repeat PSV trial this PM when afebrile
   - if tachypnic, obtain ABG
   - Control HR and BP as above
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium in setting of infection. MRI showed small
   bihemispheric lesions more likely small infarcts but cannot rule out
   infection, as well as sinus disease.
   - LP unrevealing with normal protein and glucose, 0 wbc, HSV PCR
   pending.
   - Will keep antibiotics at doses for CNS penetration.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Appears pre-renal based on urine electrolytes.
   CVP 5-8, urine output borderline low.
   - will follow I/O and CVP
   - bolus 500cc NS
   - PM lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR, exacerbated fever and agitation.
   CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she will eventually
   require consideration for anticoagulation.
   - Continue Digoxin.
   - increase diltiazem PO to 90 QID as tolerated by BP
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +10.  Counts beginning to increase today.
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   #. Febrile neutropenia:  ANC 600, and persistently febrile on
   micafungin, meropenem, daptomycin and acyclovir
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Continue neupogen until ANC greater than 1000
   - Continue micafungin (currently day 8), cefepime/meropenem (currently
   day 11), daptomycin (currently day 7), acyclovir (currently day 12)
   #. Hypertension:
   Normal ventricular function on Echo. Patient has not had hypotension
   during her current course.
   - increase diltiazem as above
   - Consider afterload reduction with IV hydralazine once HR controlled

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) earlier in the hospital course. The patient is now intubated.

The patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The urine culture is positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is sensitive to daptomycin, making it unlikely to be the source of infection. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) does not show evidence of infection. HSV PCR is pending. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) also shows no signs of infection, but a chest CT reveals multiple concerning areas in the chest. The patient also has a subcutaneous (SC) line placed on an unspecified date, and no nasogastric tube (NGT) is in place, so sinus changes on MRI are less likely to be acute.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 92 bpm (with a range of 78-132 bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 95/44 mmHg (with a range of 57-165/38-97 mmHg), respiratory rate"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and required endotracheal intubation. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode. He has been on midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain control, respectively. 

During the 24-hour period, the patient's temperature was 39.5°C, heart rate was 92 bpm, blood pressure was 95/44 mmHg, respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on FiO2 of 40%. The patient's current weight is 70 kg, which is an increase from his admission weight of 65.5 kg. 

The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 120 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count of 25,000/mm^3. The creatinine level is within normal range at 1.7 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite
   treatment with broad-spectrum abx.  Still unclear source for infection,
   but still awaiting final culture results.  Only positive result is UTI
   VRE, which is daptomycin sensitive; this is day [**9-18**] for daptomycin
   course. CSF does not show evidence of infection. HSV PCR pending. BAL
   also unrevealing, however chest CT shows multiple concering areas in
   chest.  Hickman removed yesterday.
   -  Line holiday (just 3 peripherals)
   - Culture once daily while spiking.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Give Demerol for rigors
   - Continue azithromycin/dapto/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/micafungin/acyclovir for PNA and UTI
   coverage
   - D/C clinda and primaquine since ruled out for toxo and PCP
   .
   #. Hypoxic/Respiratory failure:  Patient now intubated on CMV/ASSIT;
   failed PSV twice for unclear reasons.  Etiology of hypoxic status most
   likely from infectious source in lungs (multifocal infiltrates on CT,
   but BAL cultures negative so far) or transplant associated pneumonitis.
   - repeat PSV trial this AM when afebrile
   - if tachypnic, obtain ABG
   - Control HR and BP as above
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium in setting of infection. MRI showed small
   bihemispheric lesions more likely small infarcts but cannot rule out
   infection, as well as sinus disease.
   - LP unrevealing with normal protein and glucose, 0 wbc, HSV PCR
   pending.
   - Will keep antibiotics at doses for CNS penetration
   - Will wean sedation when patient is more stable to better assess
   mental status.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Appears pre-renal based on urine electrolytes,
   though cr. Is improving
   - will follow I/O and CVP
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR, exacerbated fever and agitation.
   CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she will eventually
   require consideration for anticoagulation.
   - Discontinue digoxin and start metoprolol.  Uptitrated today to 25mg
   TID
   - increase diltiazem PO to 90 QID as tolerated by BP
   - Control fever as much as possible
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +11.  Counts beginning to increase today.
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet
   - Consider d/c of neupogen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The source of infection is still unclear, but a urinary tract infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) has been identified. The patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage for this infection.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis does not show any evidence of infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results are also negative for infection. However, a chest CT scan reveals multiple concerning areas in the chest.

The patient's altered mental status is consistent with delirium, likely secondary to infection. An MRI showed small bihemispheric lesions that could be small infarcts or infection. The patient's renal function is showing signs of acute renal failure, which appears pre-renal in nature.

The patient's tachycardia is attributed to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has a CHADS2 score of 2, indicating a need for consideration of anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The source of infection is"

   able to continue support with 10-14/5 with adequate tolerance.  This
   morning with move to SBT patient with rapid evolution of rapid and
   shollow breaths with mild increase in heart rate associated.   This
   would suggest that although static compliance appears to be reasonable
   while supported we do see a rapid decline with move to more minimal
   levels of PEEP and pressure support.  This is all consistent with rapid
   centralization of fluid and pulmonary edema.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with multiple myeloma who has undergone bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is currently admitted with atrial fibrillation and persistent respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may be due to pulmonary edema and fluid centralization in the lungs. This is indicated by the rapid decline in lung compliance when reducing PEEP and pressure support levels.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This condition can lead to poor cardiac output, hypotension, and potential embolic events.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, possibly due to sedation or an underlying infection. Close monitoring and gradual weaning of sedation are recommended.

4. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers despite empiric antibiotic coverage. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection, and antibiotic therapy may need to be adjusted based on culture results.

5. Multiple myeloma: The patient's underlying multiple myeloma may contribute to her susceptibility to infections and other complications. Treatment for the malignancy should continue as per the BMT protocol.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization. Prophylactic measures such as"

   - repeat PSV trial this AM when afebrile
   - if tachypnic, obtain ABG
   - Control HR and BP as above

   Most consistent with delirium in setting of infection. MRI showed small
   bihemispheric lesions more likely small infarcts but cannot rule out
   infection, as well as sinus disease.
   - LP unrevealing with normal protein and glucose, 0 wbc, HSV PCR
   pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presents to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. She is now intubated. The patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her leukocyte count is markedly elevated. She has a urinary tract infection with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is sensitive to daptomycin. Other lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, electrolytes, and liver enzymes. Chest CT shows multiple concerning areas in the chest, and cultures are pending. The patient has been on multiple medications including azithromycin, daptomycin, micafungin, and acyclovir for pneumonia and urinary tract infection coverage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent high-grade fevers and leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection despite broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. It is important to identify the source of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly. Monitoring of cultures and clinical response is crucial.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and presence of multifocal infiltrates on chest CT raise concern for ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is necessary. Prone positioning and consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, presenting to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient continues to have high-grade fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The source of infection is still unclear. She has leukocytosis, which could be consistent with receiving Nupogen. A urinary tract infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has been identified, and the patient is receiving daptomycin-sensitive treatment for it.

The patient's chest X-ray shows pleural effusions, indicating increased volume overload. She also has multifocal infiltrates in her chest, which could be transplant-associated pneumonitis or atypical mycoplasma infection. A chest CT scan reveals multiple areas of small infarct versus infection, but it is difficult to differentiate without contrast.

The patient's mental status is altered, most likely due to delirium in the setting of infection. She has been on high-dose sedatives for several days and has a high sedation requirement. The patient becomes agitated when sedatives are weaned.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is pre-renal in nature, with a decreasing creatinine trend. She will be monitored closely for input/output and central venous pressure. Medications will be dos"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female with multiple myeloma now s/p BMT and now with admission
   to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure and persistent fevers.
   She has now had recovery of WBC count in the setting of BMT and would
   hope in this setting to move towards effective clearance of pulmonary
   pathogens if indeed present and driving persistent respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
Patient intubated with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure.  She now has persistent pleural
   effusions, persistent pulmonary infiltrates and persistent fevers
   noted.  These are all conspiring to maintain patient in ventilator
   dependent state.
   -Will need to check NIF to evaluate for weakness
   -Will need to move to negative fluid balance as possible
   -Will move to wean PSV today
   -This will be unlikely to improve until mental status and infection
   improved.
 PULMONARY EDEMA-
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be volume overloaded or non-specific pneumonitis driving
   persistent infiltrate and edema
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-
   -Transient tachycardia overnight but quite well controlled with control
   of patient sedation levels
   -Fentanyl 100mg/Versed 2mg IV
   FEVER-
   -HSV negative and with counts return will continue acyclovir in the
   setting of persistent fevers
   -Will continue with other ABX and micafungin, although fungal studies
   have been negative to date
   -Specifically-Daptomycin for Urinary Tract Infection and Meropenem (500
   q8 hours)/Azithromycin coverage
   -CVL D/C
d 2 days ago
   -Will continue to discuss with ID for final decisions on antibiotics
   and treatment path
   -Will follow up with MRI given persistent obtundation

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and persistent fevers. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary edema, and fever. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. bloodstream infection due to indwelling catheters.
3. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization.
4. nosocomial infection due to immunosuppression from the BMT.
5. hepatic dysfunction due to drug toxicity or sepsis.
6. renal dysfunction due to drug toxicity, hypotension, or sepsis.
7. delirium or agitation due to sedative medications or underlying infection.
8. gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration due to stress ulcer prophylaxis medications.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies should be performed to detect any potential complications early on."

   (actually we stopped azithro also, but I don't think BMT cared about
   that, as it was ID's idea).  ID wanted to stop mica, dapto, acyclovir
   and azithro but held off per BMT recs.  ID attending came by in PM and
   said we should definitely stop dapto and acyclovir tomorrow (that will
   be 10 days dapto for VRE urine and CSF was HSV neg)

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated.
   #. Fevers: Pt had only low grade fevers x 24 hours.  No clear source
   for infection. Leukocytosis consistent with receiving Nupogen. Only
   positive result is UTI VRE, which is daptomycin sensitive; this is day
   10/10-14d. LP and BAL unrevealing. Chest CT shows multifocal
   infiltrates in chest, possibly [**3-9**] transplant associated pneumonitis vs
   multifocal PNA.  Consider atypical mycoplasma which may take more time
   to grow on BAL samples. MRI also showed mutiple areas of small infarct
   vs. infection, but could not differentiate without contrast. Concern
   would be for septic emboli vs. primary intracranial infection, will
   repeat MRI today with gad.
   - MRI with gad
   - Continue dapto for UTI (last dose today per ID), acyclovir (should
   also end today per ID) and [**Last Name (un) 614**] for PNA
   -  Line holiday (just 3 peripherals)
   - Culture once daily while spiking
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Give Demerol for rigors
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient now intubated on CMV/ASSIT;
   failed PSV twice for unclear reasons.  Etiology of hypoxic status most
   likely from infectious source in lungs (multifocal infiltrates on CT,
   but BAL cultures negative so far) or transplant associated pneumonitis
   with large contribution from mental status.
   - TBB even today
    - maintain on AC today since patient has large sedation requirements
   in setting of delirium
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation.
   - cont metoprolol 37.5mg TID
   - cont diltiazem PO 90 QID
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium in setting of infection, now complicated
   by several days of high dose sedatives. Sedative requirement remains
   high, and patient becomes agitated when sedatives weaned.
   - Will obtain MRI as above.
   - start zyprexa 2.5-5mg TID PRN and attempt to decrease fentanyl/midaz
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Cr back at baseline.
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +13.
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, currently in the ICU.
- She presented with tachycardia up to 180 beats per minute and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient was intubated and is currently on CMV/ASSIST ventilation.
- She has been experiencing fevers for the past 24 hours, but no clear source of infection has been identified.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, which may be due to receiving Nupogen.
- The patient has a UTI caused by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is sensitive to daptomycin. This is on day 10/10-14 days.
- Lumbar puncture (LP) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results are unrevealing.
- A chest CT scan shows multifocal infiltrates in the chest, possibly transplant-associated pneumonitis or multifocal pneumonia.
- An MRI also revealed multiple areas of small infarcts versus infection, but it could not differentiate without contrast.
- The concern is for septic emboli versus primary intracranial infection, so an MRI with gadolinium will be repeated today.
- The plan is to continue dapto for the UTI (last dose today per Infectious Disease), acyclovir (should also end today per ID), and"

   Chief Complaint: ABX: Per BMT attending, only d/c'd micafungin
   (actually we stopped azithro also, but I don't think BMT cared about
   that, as it was ID's idea).  ID wanted to stop mica, dapto, acyclovir
   and azithro but held off per BMT recs.  ID attending came by in PM and
   said we should definitely stop dapto and acyclovir tomorrow (that will
   be 10 days dapto for VRE urine and CSF was HSV neg)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and refractory episodes. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She also has fevers, leukocytosis, and a urinary tract infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is sensitive to daptomycin. The patient has multifocal infiltrates in her chest, possibly transplant-associated pneumonitis or pneumonia. An MRI showed multiple areas of small infarct versus infection, but could not differentiate without contrast. The patient's mental status is poor, and she is experiencing delirium. She also has acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level. The patient is day +13 post-stem cell transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection with VRE and multifocal infiltrates in her chest, suggesting a possible pneumonia. The patient is also febrile, indicating an ongoing infection.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to volume overload, infectious causes (pneumonia), or transplant-associated pneumonitis. The patient failed non-invasive ventilation and required intubation.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, likely secondary to"

   complicated by respiratory failure and persistent fevers
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with persistent requirement for continued
   ventilatory support and oxygenation support with patient demonstrating
   tacypnea and tachycardia and hypertension with SBT.  This has been
   persistent across time.  What is more favorable this morning is patient
   does maintain a favorable tidal volume with 350-400cc seen rather than
   rapid decline with move to minimal support levels in the past.  In
   regards to reversible sources we have seen a decrease in intensity of
   fever, we have seen some return of WBC counts but are still faced with
   agitation and limited compliance with patient in regards to care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with multiple myeloma who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). She is currently in the ICU and experiencing respiratory failure, altered mental status, and fever. 

The patient's respiratory failure is characterized by persistent requirements for ventilatory and oxygenation support. She exhibits tachypnea (rapid breathing), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and hypertension. Sedation has been held this morning for examination, and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) will be conducted today. Arterial blood gas (ABG) will be monitored at 30 minutes of SBT.

The patient's fever is ongoing, with no identifiable source. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem, daptomycin, and acyclovir have been initiated. Acyclovir may be discontinued as herpes simplex virus (HSV) studies were negative. The course of meropenem and daptomycin will be completed based on ID recommendations.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is not delirium. Studies to date have been negative, and she is being treated with Zyprexa (antipsychotic medication) and sedation as needed.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's condition in the ICU poses several risks. These include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and glycemic control issues. The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have low grade fevers, and is currently
   afebrile at 98.6.  No clear source for infection, only urine that is
   positive for VRE (sensitive to daptomycin, and day [**12-18**] for this
   course).  Chest CT with multifocal infiltrates in chest, possibly [**3-8**]
   to transplant associated penumotnitis vs. multifocal PNA.  Consider
   atypical mycoplasma which may take more time to grow on BAL samples.
   MRI also showed mutiple areas of small infarct vs. infection, but could
   not differentiate without contrast.  MRI yesterday with no gross
   abnormalities
   - D/c daptomycin, as no evidence of resistant gram + bacteria at this
   time
   - Change acyclovir to prophylactic dose
   - Continue meropenem until sputum culture back
   - Continue
line holiday
   - Culture once daily while spiking
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Give Demerol for rigors
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient now on PSV, but failed
   extubation attempts twice in the last two days.  Etiology of hypoxic
   status most likely from volume overload, as well as possible infectious
   source in lungs (multifocal infiltrates on CT, but BAL cultures
   negative so far) or transplant associated pneumonitis with large
   contribution from mental status.
   - Lasix overnight
   - Continue on PSV
   - Extubation attempt this AM
   - NPO at MN
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation.
   - increase metoprolol to 37.5mg TID
   - cont diltiazem PO 90 QID
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium in setting of infection, now complicated
   by several days of high dose sedatives. Sedative requirement remains
   high, and patient becomes agitated when sedatives weaned.
   - start zyprexa 2.5-5mg TID PRN and attempt to decrease fentanyl/midaz
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Cr back at baseline.
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +14.
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, presenting to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in the hospital course. She is currently intubated.

The patient continues to have low-grade fevers, and is currently afebrile at 98.6. There is no clear source for infection, except for urine that is positive for VRE (sensitive to daptomycin) on day [**12-18**]. A chest CT shows multifocal infiltrates in the chest, possibly due to transplant-associated pneumonitis vs. multifocal PNA. Consider atypical mycoplasma, which may take more time to grow on BAL samples. An MRI also showed multiple areas of small infarct vs. infection, but could not differentiate without contrast. An MRI yesterday showed no gross abnormalities.

The medical team decided to:
- D/c daptomycin, as there is no evidence of resistant gram + bacteria at this time.
- Change acyclovir to a prophylactic dose.
- Continue meropenem until the sputum culture results are back.
- Continue holiday.
- Culture once daily while spiking.
- Tylenol PRN.
- Give Demerol for rigors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, who presented to the ICU with fevers and agitation after undergoing a stem cell transplantation (SCT). The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's medical history includes allergies to Percocet, ciprofloxacin, oxycodone, and rash; fever with Dr. [Doctor's Last Name]. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and antiviral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Pulmonary edema: The presence of pulmonary edema can increase the risk of respiratory distress and potential cardiac complications.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may progress to a more serious arrhythmia, potentially leading to hemodynamic instability.
4. Hypertension: If left uncontrolled, the patient's hypertension can result in end-organ damage, including cardiovascular events.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status, if not addressed, could lead to worsening confusion, increased risk of falls, and inability to maintain airway protection.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of infections and pressure ulcers.

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated.
   #. Fevers: Patient continues to have low grade fevers, and is currently
   afebrile at 98.6.  No clear source for infection, only urine that is
   positive for VRE (sensitive to daptomycin, and day [**12-18**] for this
   course).  Chest CT with multifocal infiltrates in chest, possibly [**3-8**]
   to transplant associated penumotnitis vs. multifocal PNA.  Consider
   atypical mycoplasma which may take more time to grow on BAL samples.
   MRI also showed mutiple areas of small infarct vs. infection, but could
   not differentiate without contrast.  MRI yesterday with no gross
   abnormalities
   - D/c daptomycin, as no evidence of resistant gram + bacteria at this
   time
   - Change acyclovir to prophylactic dose
   - Continue meropenem until sputum culture back
   - Continue
line holiday
   - Culture once daily while spiking
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Give Demerol for rigors
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient now on PSV, but failed
   extubation attempts twice in the last two days.  Etiology of hypoxic
   status most likely from volume overload, as well as possible infectious
   source in lungs (multifocal infiltrates on CT, but BAL cultures
   negative so far) or transplant associated pneumonitis with large
   contribution from mental status.
   - Lasix overnight
   - Continue on PSV
   - Extubation attempt this AM
   - NPO at MN
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation.
   - increase metoprolol to 50mg TID
   - cont diltiazem PO 90 QID
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium in setting of infection, now complicated
   by several days of high dose sedatives. Sedative requirement remains
   high, and patient becomes agitated when sedatives weaned.
   - start zyprexa 2.5-5mg TID PRN and attempt to decrease fentanyl/midaz
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Cr back at baseline.
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +14.
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions
   - Low bacteria diet

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She is currently in the ICU for tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
- The patient is intubated and has been experiencing low-grade fevers. There is no clear source of infection, except for urine that is positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is sensitive to daptomycin.
- Chest CT shows multifocal infiltrates in the chest, possibly indicative of transplant-associated pneumonitis or multifocal pneumonia. Atypical mycoplasma infection may also be a consideration.
- MRI results showed multiple areas of small infarct vs. infection, but it was not possible to differentiate without contrast. The latest MRI did not show any gross abnormalities.
- The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure. She has failed extubation attempts twice in the last two days.
- The etiology of hypoxic status is most likely due to volume overload, as well as possible infectious sources in the lungs or transplant-associated pneumonitis.
- The patient's tachycardia is attributed to atrial fibrillation with RVR. She has a CHADS2 score of 2, indicating the need for consideration of anticoagulation.
- The patient's mental status is altered, most likely due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, currently in the ICU. She presents with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR. The patient is intubated and has low-grade fevers, with no clear source of infection. She has positive urine for VRE, which is sensitive to daptomycin. Chest CT shows multifocal infiltrates, possibly related to transplant-associated pneumonitis or multifocal pneumonia. MRI head yesterday showed no gross abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient continues to have low-grade fevers, but no clear source of infection has been identified. This could indicate a possible ongoing infection or a response to another underlying condition.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on PSV but failed extubation attempts twice in the last two days. The etiology of hypoxic status is likely from volume overload, as well as possible infectious sources in the lungs or transplant-associated pneumonitis. Other barriers to extubation include mental status, anxiety, and fatigue.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof multiple myeloma --> s/p BMT, now hospital course complicated by
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persisitent.  Unclear etiology, but with
   persisitent abnormal CXR (predominately effusions), unfavorable RSBI,
   and poor SBT attempts.  Suspect mulitifactorial, with major
   contributions of sedation, hypomagnesemia and perhaps generalized
   weakness.  However, need to consider possible pulmonary vascular
   disease (evidence for pulmonary hypertension by echo), cardiac disease,
   or transplant-related cardiac or lung abnormalities.  Consider repeat
   cardiac echo
   FEVER -- unclear etiology.  Only isolate is VRE from urine source.  Now
   overall improved, with antimicrobials adjusted to Meropenem alone
   (other empirical Daptomycin, Acyclovir,  completed), and with WBC
   improving.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- overall, somewhat improved over past 24
   hours.    Unclear etiology (unrevealing LP and head MRI), but most
   recently attributed to sedating medications.
   TACHYCARDIA -- attributed to A-fib --> diltiazem.
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA -- s/p BMT.  Continue to monitor per usual
   post-transplant care.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He is currently hospitalized and suffering from respiratory failure, persistent fevers, and altered mental status. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. He has been on multiple antibiotics but still has a fever. His respiratory status remains unstable, with an unfavorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) and poor spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) attempts. The possible causes of respiratory failure include sedation, hypomagnesemia, generalized weakness, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac disease, or transplant-related cardiac or lung abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent and multifactorial. It is crucial to address the underlying causes such as sedation, hypomagnesemia, generalized weakness, and consider other possibilities like pulmonary hypertension, cardiac disease, or transplant-related complications.
2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers with an isolated VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) in the urine. It is essential to monitor the patient closely for any signs of infection and adjust antimicrobial therapy accordingly.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and it is unclear what the exact cause is. Sedating medications may be contributing to this condition. Further evaluation, including LP (lumbar puncture) and head MRI, may be necessary to determine the et"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating persistent respiratory failure. The cause of the respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be multifactorial, involving factors such as sedation, hypomagnesemia, generalized weakness, pulmonary vascular disease, cardiac disease, or transplant-related cardiac or lung abnormalities.

2. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers, and the source of infection is currently unclear. Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics were started empirically, but now only meropenem is being used. The patient's white blood cell count is improving, suggesting a response to the treatment.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been altered, and it is unclear what the underlying cause is. Recent sedating medications may be contributing to this alteration. Further investigation, such as a lumbar puncture and head MRI, has not revealed a clear etiology.

4. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing tachycardia, specifically atrial fibrillation. The cause is unclear, but there is concern for possible thromboembolic disease as a precipitant. Monitoring of the heart rate is recommended, and diltiazem has been initiated to manage the tachycardia.

5. Multiple myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and has undergone bone marrow"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently intubated.

The patient continues to have low-grade fevers, and there is no clear source of infection. However, her urine is positive for Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) after completing a full course of daptomycin. The chest CT shows multifocal infiltrates in the chest, which may be transplant-associated pneumonitis or multifocal pneumonia. An MRI head did not reveal any gross abnormalities.

The patient has finished her course of daptomycin for VRE, and c.diff is negative. Acyclovir was changed to a prophylactic dose, and meropenem will continue until the sputum culture results are available. The patient's respiratory support includes being on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She has failed two extubation attempts in the last two days.

Renal function has improved, and diuresis will be aggressive today. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 28, and negative inspiratory force (NIF) is -20, indicating a need for increased training and better nutrition before considering extubation. The patient is currently NPO for possible extubation today.

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in the hospital course. She is now intubated.

The patient continues to have low-grade fevers and is currently afebrile at 98.3. No clear source for infection has been identified, except for urine that is positive for VRE after completing a full course of dapto. A chest CT shows multifocal infiltrates in the chest, possibly transplant-associated pneumonitis or multifocal PNA. Consideration is being given to atypical mycoplasma, which may take more time to grow on BAL samples. An MRI head without gross abnormalities was performed.

The patient has finished her course of dapto for VRE. C.diff is negative yesterday, and acyclovir has been changed to a prophylactic dose. Meropenem will be continued until the sputum culture returns (day 1). The patient's line holiday will be continued, with cultures once daily while spiking. Tylenol will be given as needed for pain, and Demerol will be administered for rigors.

The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently on PSV but failed extubation attempts twice in the last two days. The etiology of hypoxic status is likely from volume"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who is currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with tachycardia to 180s, multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR, and is now intubated. The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, with no clear source of infection except for a positive urine culture for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) after completing a full course of daptomycin. A chest CT shows multifocal infiltrates in the chest, possibly transplant-associated pneumonitis or multifocal pneumonia. Other notable findings include renal function improvement, altered mental status consistent with delirium due to infection and high-dose sedatives, and acute renal failure with creatinine levels returning to baseline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers and has a positive urine culture for VRE. Multifocal infiltrates on the chest CT suggest the possibility of pneumonia or transplant-associated pneumonitis. The patient is also on prophylactic acyclovir due to the stem cell transplant. These findings indicate a potential risk for further infections.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She failed spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) twice, indicating difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The multifocal infiltrates on the chest"

   75 yof multiple myeloma --> s/p BMT, now hospital course complicated by
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persisitent.  Unclear etiology, but with
   persisitent abnormal CXR (predominately effusions), unfavorable RSBI,
   marginal NIF, and poor SBT attempts.  Suspect mulitifactorial, with
   major contributions of sedation, hypomagnesemia and perhaps generalized
   weakness.  No evidence for pulmonary vascular disease (evidence for
   pulmonary hypertension by echo), cardiac disease, or transplant-related
   cardiac or lung abnormalities.  Persistent bilateral lung atalectasis
   and/or consolidation).  Consider repeat cardiac echo as f/u to
   pulmonary hypertension.
   FEVER -- unclear etiology.  Only isolate is VRE from urine source.  Now
   overall improved, with antimicrobials adjusted to Meropenem alone
   (other empirical Daptomycin, Acyclovir,  completed), and with WBC
   increasing.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- overall, much more improved over past 24 hours
   (continues to improve over past 48 hours).    Unclear etiology
   (unrevealing LP and head MRI), but most recently attributed to sedating
   medications.  Monitor exam.
   TACHYCARDIA -- attributed to A-fib --> diltiazem.  Unclear etiology,
   but concern for possible thromboembolic disease as precipitant.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He is currently hospitalized and has been complicated by respiratory failure, persistent fevers, altered mental status, tachycardia, and nutritional support.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure with an unclear etiology. There are no evidence of pulmonary vascular disease, cardiac disease, or transplant-related cardiac or lung abnormalities. The patient has bilateral lung atelectasis and/or consolidation.
2. Fever: The patient has persistent fever with an unclear etiology. Only one isolate, VRE from urine source, has been identified. The patient's overall condition has improved with antimicrobials adjusted to Meropenem alone.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved over the past 24 hours. The cause of the altered mental status is unclear, but it is most recently attributed to sedating medications. Monitoring of the patient's exam is recommended.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia attributed to atrial fibrillation (A-fib). Diltiazem has been initiated to control the heart rate. The etiology of the tachycardia is unclear, but concern for possible thromboembolic disease as a precipitant exists.
5. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and has undergone B"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old individual with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The patient's current hospital course is complicated by respiratory failure, persistent fevers, altered mental status, tachycardia, and nutritional support.

The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with no evidence of central pulmonary embolism on the CT angio chest. The patient is more awake and interactive today. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/36 mmHg to 197/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal cardiovascular examination. However, there is evidence of right lower extremity edema and trace left lower extremity edema. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7, and low magnesium level of 0.9 mg/dL. Other lab values show within normal limits.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma.
- She presents to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- She has had multiple episodes of fevers, which have resolved after treatment for a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload and possible underlying lung infection.
- She has a high CHADS2 score for atrial fibrillation, indicating a need for consideration of anticoagulation.
- The patient is experiencing altered mental status, consistent with delirium in the setting of infection and high-dose sedative use.
- She has acute renal failure with creatinine levels returning to baseline.
- The patient is day +15 post-stem cell transplant.
- She is on a low bacteria diet and transplant precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and risk factors such as altered mental status and volume overload, there is a potential for developing VAP. The VAP bundle prophylaxis is in place to reduce the risk.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization due to being intubated increases the risk of developing DVT. The use of pneumatic boots is a preventive measure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who is currently in the ICU. She was admitted with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which have resolved her fevers. Her mental status is improving, and she is alert and interactive. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, consistent with delirium, but it is improving. Her renal function has returned to baseline, and she is on day +15 post-stem cell transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as she failed two extubation attempts. There may be an underlying infectious source in the lungs contributing to her hypoxia. Continued diuresis and optimization for extubation are planned.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be controlled. Propofol was used yesterday with better rate control, and the plan is to continue rate control after extubation with IV medications such as metoprolol or diltiazem.
3. Altered mental status: The patient initially presented with delirium but is now alert and interactive. Zyprexa is being used as needed for continued management of mental status"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof multiple myeloma --> s/p BMT, now hospital course complicated by
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persisitent.  Unclear etiology, but with
   persisitent abnormal CXR (predominately effusions), unfavorable RSBI,
   marginal NIF, and poor SBT attempts.  Suspect mulitifactorial, with
   major contributions of sedation, hypomagnesemia and perhaps generalized
   weakness.  No evidence for pulmonary vascular disease (evidence for
   pulmonary hypertension by echo), cardiac disease, or transplant-related
   cardiac or lung abnormalities.  Persistent bilateral lung atalectasis
   and/or consolidation.  Tolerated net diuresis with radigraphic
   improvement of bilateral effusions.  Consider repeat cardiac echo as
   f/u to pulmonary hypertension.  Hope to move to trial of extubation.
   FEVER -- unclear etiology, now resolved.  Only isolate is VRE from
   urine source.  Now overall improved, with antimicrobials adjusted to
   Meropenem alone (other empirical Daptomycin, Acyclovir,  completed),
   and with WBC increasing.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- overall, much more improved over past 24 hours
   (continues to improve over past 48 hours).    Unclear etiology
   (unrevealing LP and head MRI), but most recently attributed to sedating
   medications.  Monitor exam.
   TACHYCARDIA -- attributed to A-fib --> diltiazem.  Unclear etiology,
   but concern for possible thromboembolic disease as precipitant.
   Monitor HR.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA -- s/p BMT.  Continue to monitor per usual
   post-transplant care.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a bone marrow transplant. He is currently hospitalized and experiencing respiratory failure. The cause of the respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be multifactorial, including sedation, hypomagnesemia, and generalized weakness. The patient also had persistent fevers, which have now resolved. The only isolate found was VRE from the urine source. 

The patient's altered mental status has improved over the past 24 hours and is likely due to sedating medications. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, which is being treated with diltiazem. The etiology of the tachycardia is unclear, but there is a concern for possible thromboembolic disease as a precipitant. 

The patient's potassium levels were initially low but have been repleted. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and is undergoing usual post-transplant care. Nutritional support is being provided through tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and sedation medications may"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof multiple myeloma --> s/p BMT, now hospital course complicated by
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persisitent.  Unclear etiology, but with
   persisitent abnormal CXR (predominately effusions), unfavorable RSBI,
   marginal NIF, and poor SBT attempts.  Suspect mulitifactorial, with
   major contributions of sedation, hypomagnesemia and perhaps generalized
   weakness.  No evidence for pulmonary vascular disease (evidence for
   pulmonary hypertension by echo), cardiac disease, or transplant-related
   cardiac or lung abnormalities.  Persistent bilateral lung atalectasis
   and/or consolidation.  Tolerated net diuresis with radigraphic
   improvement of bilateral effusions.  Consider repeat cardiac echo as
   f/u to pulmonary hypertension.
   FEVER -- unclear etiology, now resolved.  Only isolate is VRE from
   urine source.  Now overall improved, with antimicrobials adjusted to
   Meropenem alone (other empirical Daptomycin, Acyclovir,  completed),
   and with WBC increasing.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- overall, much more improved over past 24 hours
   (continues to improve over past 48 hours).    Unclear etiology
   (unrevealing LP and head MRI), but most recently attributed to sedating
   medications.  Monitor exam.
   TACHYCARDIA -- attributed to A-fib --> diltiazem.  Unclear etiology,
   but concern for possible thromboembolic disease as precipitant.
   Monitor HR.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA -- s/p BMT.  Continue to monitor per usual
   post-transplant care.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, sedated with propofol. He tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning with propofol off.

The patient has a history of allergies to Percocet (oral), causing nausea and vomiting, as well as a rash from ciprofloxacin. The last doses of antibiotics administered were daptomycin on [**2112-2-4**] at 06:45 PM, meropenem on [**2112-2-6**] at 09:45 PM, and acyclovir on [**2112-2-7**] at 05:54 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 88 bpm (with atrial fibrillation), blood pressure ranging from 132/68 mmHg to 160/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion at 30 mcg/kg/min and other medications include furosemide (Lasix).

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for fatigue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, hypertension, and altered mental status. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. The patient has been extubated and is doing well on invasive ventilation. He has been diuresed with IV Lasix and has become hypernatremic with a free water deficit of 2L. The patient is taking pills and sips of POs, remains anxious and intermittently agitated, and is on Haldol 2mg q6h prn, morphine for discomfort. He has urinary irritation possibly from Foley, and Pyridium has been tried. Foley will be discontinued when possible. The patient's allergies include Percocet (oral), nausea/vomiting, ciprofloxacin rash; fever, and oxycodone hallucinations. The last doses of antibiotics were acyclovir on 02/07/2012 at 11:48 PM and meropenem on 02/08/2012 at 03:58 AM. The patient is currently on several medications including furosemide (Lasix), morphine sulfate, metoprolol, and haloperidol (Haldol). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed.
2. Pulmonary"

   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now intubated.
   #. Fevers: Patient afebrile x 48h.  s/p course of dapto for UTI.  Most
   likely pt had neutropenic fevers that have resolved with recovering
   counts.

   -  cont meropenem given fever within past 72 hours, f/u BMT about
   D/Cing -> will cont for now
   - Continue
line holiday
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from volume overload, as well as possible underlying  infectious source
   in lungs, but is becoming less likely after course of broad spectrum
   abx and no fevers.  Mental status is improved off of midazolam.   CT
   showed no PE, unchanged  bilateral pleural effusions. Diuresis likely
   aided extubation yesterday.  Patient tolerating extubation well
   - cont diuresis, TBB goal neg >1L via PRN diuretics
   - speech and swallow eval s/p extubation
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation. Will need continued rate control.
   - cont metoprolol to 50mg TID
   - cont diltiazem PO 90 QID
   - Daily weights
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   - will consider anti-coag today with warfarin
   .
   #  Anemia- Hct drop from 28 to23.8.  No obvious sign of hemorrhage.
   - will guaiac stool, check retic
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, now improving. Patient alert and
   interactive, answering questions appropriately.
   - zyprexa 2.5-5mg TID PRN
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Cr back at baseline.
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. They were previously on invasive ventilation but were successfully extubated and are now on CPAP/PSV with nasal cannula. The patient has shown improvement in their respiratory status.

The patient has a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma and presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. They were intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure, but are now tolerating extubation well.

The patient's mental status has improved since being taken off midazolam. A CT scan showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed bilateral pleural effusions. The patient underwent diuresis, which likely aided their extubation. 

The patient's tachycardia is due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. They have a CHADS2 score of 2, indicating a need for rate control and consideration of anticoagulation in the future. 

The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 28% to 23.8%, but there are no obvious signs of hemorrhage. The patient's altered mental status is consistent with delirium, which is now improving. 

The patient is day +16 post stem cell transplant and has a history of multiple myeloma. They require further management from the BMT team.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. They have a history of multiple myeloma (cancer), hypertension, and altered mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 143/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, and blood transfusions. The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, such as an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with frequent assessments of vital signs, oxygenation, and fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxic respiratory failure, and they are still experiencing respiratory distress despite receiving supplemental oxygen. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which could necessitate advanced respiratory support like mechanical ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever may indicate an underlying infection, such as pneumonia. This could worsen the patient's respiratory status and potentially lead to sepsis.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has"

   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from volume overload, as well as possible underlying  infectious source
   in lungs, but is becoming less likely after course of broad spectrum
   abx and no fevers.  Mental status improved off of midazolam.   CT
   showed no PE, unchanged  bilateral pleural effusions. Diuresis likely
   aided extubation.  Patient tolerating extubation well.  Exam and CXR
   suggest bilateral pleural effusions, left > right.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation. She was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The etiology of her hypoxic status is believed to be volume overload and possible underlying lung infection, but this is less likely after receiving a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics and no fevers. Her mental status has improved since discontinuing midazolam. A CT scan showed no pulmonary embolism and revealed bilateral pleural effusions, with the left side being more prominent than the right. Diuretics were started to aid in fluid removal. The patient tolerated extubation well. 

Other issues include fevers, which have resolved with recovering white blood cell counts. She is currently on prophylactic antibiotics and will have meropenem discontinued since she is afebrile. The patient also has tachycardia due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She requires rate control and consideration for anticoagulation due to a CHADS2 score of 2. Anemia has developed, with a decrease in hematocrit from 28% to 23.8%. This is being monitored, and one unit of packed red blood cells may be given per blood transfusion. The patient's altered mental status is improving and is consistent with delirium. Acute renal failure has resolved, and the patient is on day +18 post-stem cell transplant."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who presents to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in the hospital course. She is now intubated.
- The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure due to pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. Despite excellent diuresis, she had increasing oxygen requirements, with tachypnea, agitation, and tachycardia. She required re-intubation and showed improved oxygenation on positive pressure ventilation, likely due to re-expansion of her atelectatic lung.
- The patient also has fevers, which were most likely neutropenic fevers that have resolved with recovering counts. She is still on prophylactic antibiotics.
- She has tachycardia due to atrial fibrillation with RVR. Her CHADS2 score is 2, so she will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control is being achieved with decreased agitation, sedation, and medication.
- The patient has anemia with a drop in Hct from 28 to 23.8. Her HCT is now stable at 24.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU due to refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely caused by pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. Despite diuresis, her oxygen requirements have been increasing, leading to re-intubation. The patient's A-A gradient is significantly elevated at 480, indicating severe hypoxemia.

The patient's fevers have resolved, possibly due to a course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. However, she is still on prophylactic acyclovir and Bactrim.

Her tachycardia is attributed to atrial fibrillation with RVR. She has a CHADS2 score of 2, indicating the need for consideration of anticoagulation. Rate control is being achieved with metoprolol and diltiazem.

The patient has experienced anemia, with a drop in Hct from 28% to 23.8%. Her Hct has stabilized at 24%. Further evaluation for the cause of anemia is recommended.

The patient's altered mental status is consistent with delirium, which is improving. She is now alert and interactive. Medications such as zyprexa and hald"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, multiple myeloma (cancer), and altered mental status. The patient underwent several procedures including a thoracentesis, placement of a PICC line, and an arterial line. The patient's temperature is elevated at 102.1°F, and there is a concern for possible pneumonia or infection. 

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure and a heart rate within normal limits. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, set tidal volume of 400 mL, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient has a history of allergies to Percocet, ciprofloxacin, and oxycodone. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and lasix.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose level, elevated lactate level, and elevated LDH. Imaging shows bilateral large pleural effusions but no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, pulmonary edema, and impaired skin integrity."

   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia.  ABG on 80% facemask revealed a paO2 of 51,
   with high A-A gradient.  At this point Ms. [**Known lastname 12343**] had to be
   re-intubated.  Her improved oxygenation on positive pressure
   ventilation.  Suspect patient required more aggressive diuresis
   post-extubation in setting of LVH and likely elevated filling pressures
   exacerbated by a. fib with RVR, unfortunately, did not respond to
   diuretics in setting of possible contrast-induced nephropathy.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma.
- She presented to the ICU with refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation and was re-intubated.
- She has hypoxic respiratory failure due to pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung.
- The patient had fevers that have resolved with recovering counts.
- She has tachycardia due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- Her Hct has dropped from 28 to 23.8.
- She is alert and interactive, improving from delirium.
- She has acute renal failure with creatinine back at baseline.
- She is day +19 post-stem cell transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic status is likely due to pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. This condition can worsen and lead to further respiratory compromise if not managed properly.
2. Fevers: Although the patient's fevers have resolved, there is still a possibility of recurrent neutropenic fevers due to her immunocompromised state from the stem cell transplant. Monitoring for any signs of infection is crucial.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to hemodynamic instability and increased risk of thromboembolic events. It is essential to maintain rate control and"

   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia.  ABG on 80% facemask revealed a paO2 of 51,
   with high A-A gradient.  At this point Ms. [**Known lastname 12343**] had to be
   re-intubated.  Her improved oxygenation on positive pressure
   ventilation.  Suspect patient required more aggressive diuresis
   post-extubation in setting of LVH and likely elevated filling pressures
   exacerbated by a. fib with RVR, unfortunately, did not respond to
   diuretics in setting of possible contrast-induced nephropathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and was re-intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by large pleural effusions. She also had fevers that resolved with antibiotics, tachycardia related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, altered mental status consistent with delirium, and acute renal failure possibly due to contrast nephropathy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is alert and interactive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial hypoxic status was due to pleural effusions causing shunting through atelectatic lung. She required re-intubation and improved oxygenation on positive pressure ventilation.
2. Fevers: The patient had fevers that were initially managed with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. The source of infection could be related to her underlying multiple myeloma or other complications such as pneumonia.
3. Tachycardia: The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which contributed to her tachycardia. Rate control is essential, and she may eventually require anticoagulation considering her CHADS2 score of 2.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 28% to 23.8%, indicating significant anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She is currently intubated.

The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. Despite diuresis, her oxygen requirements increased, leading to re-intubation. Improved oxygenation on positive pressure ventilation may be related to re-expansion of her atelectatic lung.

The patient had fevers, which resolved with recovering counts. Empiric antibiotics were started, and observation off vancomycin was recommended.

Tachycardia is attributed to atrial fibrillation with RVR. A CHADS2 score of 2 indicates the need for anticoagulation, which will be considered when hemoglobin concentration stabilizes. Rate control is being achieved with metoprolol and diltiazem.

There is a decrease in hemoglobin concentration from 28% to 23.8%. Further evaluation is needed, including guaiac stool and retic count.

The patient's altered mental status is improving, now alert and interactive. Antipsychotic medication was administered.

Acute renal failure occurred, with creatinine returning to baseline. Monitoring for contrast nephropathy or lasix-induced"

   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia.  ABG on 80% facemask revealed a paO2 of 51,
   with high A-A gradient.  At this point Ms. [**Known lastname 12343**] had to be
   re-intubated.  Her improved oxygenation on positive pressure
   ventilation.  Suspect patient required more aggressive diuresis
   post-extubation in setting of LVH and likely elevated filling pressures
   exacerbated by a. fib with RVR, unfortunately, did not respond to
   diuretics in setting of possible contrast-induced nephropathy.

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma who presented to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) earlier in the hospital course. She has been re-intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. The patient's oxygenation improved on positive pressure ventilation, but she required more aggressive diuresis post-extubation in the setting of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and likely elevated filling pressures exacerbated by AF with RVR. However, she did not respond to diuretics due to possible contrast-induced nephropathy.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension and fevers, which may be caused by pneumonia or an abdominal infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Empiric coverage for C. difficile has also been initiated due to her abdominal exam and prolonged course of antibiotics. A mini-balloon atrial septostomy (mini-BAL) will be performed to evaluate for infection in the lung, including possible Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presents to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring re-intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute kidney injury, anemia, and altered mental status.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. She has been on diuretics but has not responded adequately. There is a suspicion of transudative effusion, possibly caused by diastolic heart failure. A thoracentesis is suggested to further evaluate the effusion.

The patient's fever and hypotension indicate potential sepsis. She has been pan-cultured and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Empiric treatment for C. difficile has also been initiated.

The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with a rising creatinine level. The etiology could be contrast-induced nephropathy or ischemic acute tubular necrosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

The patient has an atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may be due to atrial stretch and possibly exacerbated by infection. Rate control measures are necessary, and anticoagulation should be considered due to her CHADS2 score of 2.

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia.  ABG on 80% facemask revealed a paO2 of 51,
   with high A-A gradient.  At this point Ms. [**Known lastname 12343**] had to be
   re-intubated.  Her improved oxygenation on positive pressure
   ventilation.  Suspect patient required more aggressive diuresis
   post-extubation in setting of LVH and likely elevated filling pressures
   exacerbated by a. fib with RVR, unfortunately, did not respond to
   diuretics in setting of possible contrast-induced nephropathy.
   - favor continuing diuresis, will discuss with team
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - thoracentesis suggest transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**] diastolic CHF
   in setting of a. fib with RVR
   - appreciate Cardiology recs, low suspicion for amyloid given lack of
   echocardiographic findings
   - will perform mini-BAL, see below
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever yesterday, pan-cultured,
   started on broad coverage Abx with vanc and zosyn.  s/p course of dapto
   for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  Most likely pt had neutropenic fevers that have
   resolved with recovering counts.  Etiology of current fever pneumonia
   vs. abdominal course.  Requiring levophed today for hypotension.
   - will treat empirically for C. diff given her abdominal exam,
   prolonged course of Abx
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   - mini BAL to eval for infection in lung, ? PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cont [**Name9 (PRE) **] and zosyn, although will limit GNR coverage if no culture
   data
   - cont to wean levophed as able
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine trending up.  Etiology contrast-induced nephropathy
   vs. ischemic ATN.  Patient has only been on prophylactic dose of
   bactrim.  Less likely pre-renal/post-renal.
   - will send urine lytes
   - will consult Nephrology, appreciate recs
   - will renally dose meds
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation. Will need continued rate control.  Rate control is
   actually best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on
   ventilator.  Etiology of a. fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and
   exacerbated by possible infection.
   - will attempt to decrease metoprolol
   - cont diltiazem PO 90 QID
   - Cards input re: rhythym control greatly appreciated; team is
   considering ;amio load for chemical cardioversion
   - will consider anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has been intubated twice. Her current condition includes hypotension, fevers, acute kidney injury, tachycardia, anemia, and altered mental status. She is also a post-stem cell transplant patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying causes such as pleural effusions and atelectasis are not effectively managed.
2. Infection: The presence of fevers and neutropenic fever suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but additional cultures and mini-BAL may be needed to identify the causative organism.
3. Contrast-Induced Nephropathy: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate potential kidney injury, possibly due to contrast exposure during imaging studies. Monitoring renal function and consulting nephrology would be crucial in managing this complication.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs close monitoring and rate control. Anti-coagulation therapy may be considered to prevent thromboembolic events.
5. Multiple Myeloma Progression: As the patient is a post-stem cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone various tests and interventions. The patient's condition includes fever, altered mental status, respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and multiple myeloma. The patient is on multiple medications including norepinephrine, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is an infection or if the ventilator settings need to be adjusted.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and altered mental status could indicate an infection, which may lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if fluid overload occurs or if there are issues with cardiac function.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be monitored closely as it can increase the risk of clot formation and stroke.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed to prevent complications such as heart attack or stroke.
6. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's underlying multiple myeloma may contribute to increased susceptibility to infections and organ dysfunction.
7. Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity requires"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 54%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow due to
   absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt left
   heart failure. Off pressors.
   - obtain repeat numbers from Swan, then consider D/Cing or converting
   to triple lumen
   - f/u CXR for Swan position
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia, with hypoxemia requiring re-intubation.
   Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**] diastolic CHF
   in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed too
   aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] likely remains total volume overloaded, goal TBB -500cc today
   - control AF with RVR, rhythm conversion would help by adding atrial
   kick
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for 24
   hours.On vanc, zosyn, Flagyl.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric
   [**Last Name (un) **].  No positive cx, C. dif negative x 2.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting
   - send 3^rd C dif, consider D/C Flagyl if negative
   - redose vancomycin q24h and check level before 3^rd dose ([**2-16**])
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine trending down. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial,
   in setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will [**Name2 (NI) **] dose meds
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation. Will need continued rate control.  Rate control is
   actually best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on
   ventilator.  Etiology of a. fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and
   exacerbated by possible infection.
   - start dilt gtt
   - digoxin load
   - will consider amio load if above fails
   - unlikely to benefit from cardioversion while volume overloaded since
   will not maintain sinus
   - will consider anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct drop from 27 to 24 with no obvious
   source. Plt 134 to 108.
   - check retic count, B12, folate and iron studies (bone marrow may not
   have nutritional reserves to respond to stress)
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   - transfusion goals Hct>25 (if still has poor Sv02) and plt>50 only if
   bleeding
   .
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium
   - zyprexa 2.5-5mg TID
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She has been admitted to the ICU due to multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), tachycardia, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 90/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2, and temperature of 37.3°C. The patient's cardiac output is measured at approximately 3 L/min with a cardiac index near 2-2.5 L/min/m2. The mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is at 54%.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with RVR, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, fevers, acute kidney injury (ischemic ATN), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient also has a history of multiple myeloma and has undergone a stem cell transplant.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who presented to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). She has been re-intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. The patient's cardiac output is low, with a cardiac index (CI) near 2-2.5, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 54%. She also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status, likely due to delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Function: The patient may have reduced forward flow due to absent atrial kick and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) in AF with RVR. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and cardiac parameters is necessary. Close attention should be given to fluid balance, as the patient may require IV fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The etiology of hypoxic status is most likely from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. Despite diuresis, the patient had increasing tachypnea, agitation, and tachycardia, with hypoxemia requiring re-intubation."

   Concern that patient may have diastolic dysfunction given the echo
   findings and the PA cath data. The persistent tachycardia may be
   complicating her cardiac output and contributing to ongoing CHF. PA
   cath no longer able to achieve a PCWP. Will restart diltiazem by IV
   infusion for rate control. If it is inadequate or leads to unacceptable
   hypotension, would switch to amiodarone. Suspect we can continue to
   diurse given BUN/Creat ratio and CXR yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] not be able to
   mobilize fluid more than 0.5 L/day. Thus, would not aim for negative
   fluid balance of more than 0.5 L today. Renal function is improving
   from episode of presumed ATN.
   Given that patient had Tmax < [**Age over 90 **] yesterday, would continue antibiotics
   despite absence of specific culture results to guide therapy.
   Hct drifting down slightly. Not at transfusion threshold today, but if
   mixed venous O2 sat still below 60, would consider transfusion.
   Coming down slowly on sedation. Not agitated at this time.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill, elderly individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and anemia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to inadequate tidal volumes. Transient use of levophed was required, but the patient was able to come off pressors with fluid administration. The patient is being treated for presumed pulmonary source of fever with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. There is a concern for diastolic dysfunction, persistent tachycardia, and ongoing congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's altered mental status is not consistent with delirium. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic dysfunction: This can lead to decreased cardiac output and contribute to ongoing CHF.
2. Persistent tachycardia: It may further complicate cardiac output and contribute to hypotension.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure and CHF can result in fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema.
4. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient's heart rhythm is currently in AFib, which can cause irregular and rapid heart rate and potentially lead to complications such as stroke.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion or disorientation may worsen, potentially leading to"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, will d/c Swan, convert to triple lumen to allow
   continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia, with hypoxemia requiring re-intubation.
   Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**] diastolic CHF
   in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed too
   aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] remains total volume overloaded, goal TBB -1000cc today

   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for 48
   hours.  On vanc, zosyn; Flagyl for C. diff.  s/p course of dapto for
   UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No positive cx, C. dif negative x 3.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting
   - cont empiric flagyl despite (-) C. diff studies
   - redose vancomycin q24h and check level before 3^rd dose ([**2-16**])
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine stable. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in
   setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will [**Name2 (NI) **] dose meds, recheck urine lytes today
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation. Will need continued rate control.  Rate control is
   actually best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on
   ventilator.  Etiology of a. fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and
   exacerbated by possible infection.
   - weab dilt gtt to off, cont digoxin load
   - will consider amio load if above fails
   - unlikely to benefit from cardioversion while volume overloaded since
   will not maintain sinus
   - will consider anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct drop from 27 to 24 with no obvious
   source. Plt 134 to 108.
   - B12, folate and iron studies normal
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   - transfusion goals Hct>25 (if still has poor Sv02) and plt>50 only if
   bleeding

   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium.  Discontinued zyprexa given prolonged QT
   .

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been re-intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's cardiac output is measured with a PA catheter, with a value of approximately 3 liters per minute, and her cardiac index is near 2-2.5 liters per minute per square meter. The mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 40-50%. The patient may have reduced forward flow due to the absence of atrial kick and diastolic heart failure in AF with RVR. She is off pressors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been sedated and unable to provide his own history. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's chest X-ray shows clear lung fields bilaterally, and his arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2 of 175 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 20 mEq/L.

Potential Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure could potentially progress to pneumonia due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased venous return increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can lead to DVT.
3. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at risk for stress ulcer bleeding due to increased gastric acid"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 54%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow due to
   absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt left
   heart failure. Off pressors.
   - obtain repeat numbers from Swan, then consider D/Cing or converting
   to triple lumen
   - f/u CXR for Swan position
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia, with hypoxemia requiring re-intubation.
   Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**] diastolic CHF
   in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed too
   aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] likely remains total volume overloaded, goal TBB -500cc today
   - control AF with RVR, rhythm conversion would help by adding atrial
   kick
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for 24
   hours.On vanc, zosyn, Flagyl.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric
   [**Last Name (un) **].  No positive cx, C. dif negative x 2.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting
   - send 3^rd C dif, consider D/C Flagyl if negative
   - redose vancomycin q24h and check level before 3^rd dose ([**2-16**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presents to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) earlier in the hospital course. She has been re-intubated. The cardiac output measured with a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter is approximately 3, with a cardiac index (CI) near 2-2.5 and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 54%. The patient may have reduced forward flow due to absent atrial kick and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) in AF with RVR, but no overt left heart failure. She is off pressors.

The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely caused by pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. Despite diuresis, she experienced increasing tachypnea, agitation, and tachycardia, with hypoxemia requiring re-intubation. Thoracentesis suggested a transudative effusion, likely diastolic CHF in the setting of AF with RVR. The patient was initially diuresed too aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty responding to Lasix in the setting of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). BAL results are negative for bacterial, fungal, and Pneumocystis j"

   Heart rate now under better control. Reducing dose of diltiazem.
   Cardiac index still on low side yesterday but BP has been better with
   lower rate. With CXR still showing gross evidence of pulmonary edema
   and with oxygen saturations a bit lower today, will begin diuresis to
   achieve negative fluid balance of 0.5-1.0 L/day. Will remove PA cath
   today and replace with triple lumen catheter.
   Hct up to 28 with transfusion of PRBCs yesterday.
   Will complete 7 day course of antibiotics. Cultures remain normal.
   Try to reduce sedation now; patient changed from assist control to PSV
   - may be more comfortable on that ventilation mode.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old overweight male with a history of atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, benign hypertension, altered mental status, and multiple myeloma. He also has chronic diastolic heart failure and pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for developing pressure ulcers.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate an infection leading to sepsis.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on medication for rate control. There is a risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure and pulmonary edema may lead to further pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or worsening respiratory distress.
7. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): The patient's multiple organ dysfunction (heart"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, will d/c Swan, convert to triple lumen to allow
   continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia, with hypoxemia requiring re-intubation.
   Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**] diastolic CHF
   in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed too
   aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] remains total volume overloaded, goal TBB -1000cc today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin, goal is to d/c dilt gtt, convert to
   PO dilt if needed
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for 48
   hours.  On vanc, zosyn; Flagyl for C. diff.  s/p course of dapto for
   UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No positive cx, C. dif negative x 3.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting
   - cont empiric flagyl despite (-) C. diff studies
   - redose vancomycin q24h and check level before 3^rd dose ([**2-16**])
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine stable. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in
   setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will [**Name2 (NI) **] dose meds, recheck urine lytes today
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation. Will need continued rate control.  Rate control is
   actually best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on
   ventilator.  Etiology of a. fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and
   exacerbated by possible infection.
   - weab dilt gtt to off, cont digoxin load
   - will consider amio load if above fails
   - unlikely to benefit from cardioversion while volume overloaded since
   will not maintain sinus
   - will consider anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct drop from 27 to 24 with no obvious
   source. Plt 134 to 108.
   - B12, folate and iron studies normal
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   - transfusion goals Hct>25 (if still has poor Sv02) and plt>50 only if
   bleeding
   .
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium.  Discontinued zyprexa given prolonged QT
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +21
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, presenting to the ICU with refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She has been re-intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. The etiology of her hypoxic status is likely diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR.

The patient has been on various medications including digoxin, Lasix, heparin sodium, furosemide, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and others. She has also received multiple doses of antibiotics such as vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, acyclovir, and metronidazole.

Her lab results show an elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI). She has stable renal function with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, which is likely ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, and possible additive component of contrast-induced nephropathy. There is no indication for renal replacement therapy (RRT).

The patient's cardiac output is measured with a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter, showing a cardiac"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, discontinued Swan, converted to triple lumen to
   allow continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia, with hypoxemia requiring re-intubation.
   Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**] diastolic CHF
   in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed too
   aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is hypervolemic, will proceed with diuresis
   today, hopefully this will begin to optimize her pulmonary status.
   - remains total volume overloaded, goal TBB -2000cc today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin, cont to hold on other rate
   controlling meds
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for 72
   hours.  On vanc, zosyn.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, C. dif negative x 3.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**6-10**]
   - will discontinue flagyl
   - cont vancomycin q24h
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine stable. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in
   setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria.  Cont goal of diuresis as above.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will consider [**Month/Day (4) **] dosing meds
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation. Will need continued rate control.  Rate control is
   actually best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on
   ventilator.  Etiology of a. fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and
   exacerbated by possible infection.
   - cont digoxin, hold off other rate controlling meds
   - unlikely to benefit from cardioversion while volume overloaded since
   will not maintain sinus
   - will consider anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct drop from 27 to 24 with no obvious
   source. Plt 134 to 108.
   - B12, folate and iron studies normal
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   - transfusion goals Hct>25 (if still has poor Sv02) and plt>50 only if
   bleeding
   .
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, now resolved.  Discontinued zyprexa
   given prolonged QT

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was initially intubated but required re-intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pleural effusions and secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. The patient's cardiac output is reduced, and she has diastolic heart failure, which may be contributing to her hypoxemia. She has been on diuretics, but her fluid overload persists. Her blood cultures are negative, and she has been afebrile for 72 hours. She has a history of fevers and hypotension, for which she was given empirical antibiotics. The patient also has acute kidney injury, likely due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis, possibly exacerbated by sepsis, diuresis, and contrast-induced nephropathy. She is being managed with diuretics and will be monitored closely. The patient's tachycardia is attributed to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control is being achieved with digoxin, and anticoagulation will be considered when her hematocrit stabilizes. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are unexplained but being monitored. She has delirium, which has resolved, and is on transplant precautions as she is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated. The medical team has performed various interventions, including stopping the PA catheter, starting multi lumen access, administering Lasix, converting Swan to triple lumen over wire, and adjusting medications such as digoxin and sedation.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/51 to 138/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH 7.43, PaCO2 32 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels,"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, discontinued Swan, converted to triple lumen to
   allow continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Despite diuresis, albeit mild, she had increasing tachypnea,
   agitation, and tachycardia, with hypoxemia requiring re-intubation.
   Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**] diastolic CHF
   in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed too
   aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is hypervolemic, will proceed with diuresis
   today, hopefully this will begin to optimize her pulmonary status.
   - remains total volume overloaded, goal TBB -2000cc today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin, cont to hold on other rate
   controlling meds
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for 48
   hours.  On vanc, zosyn.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, C. dif negative x 3.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting
   - will discontinue flagyl
   - redose vancomycin q24h and check level before 3^rd dose ([**2-16**])
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine stable. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in
   setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will [**Name2 (NI) **] dose meds, recheck urine lytes today
   .
   #. Tachycardia:  Afib with RVR.  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and
   hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for
   anticoagulation. Will need continued rate control.  Rate control is
   actually best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on
   ventilator.  Etiology of a. fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and
   exacerbated by possible infection.
   - weab dilt gtt to off, cont digoxin load
   - will consider amio load if above fails
   - unlikely to benefit from cardioversion while volume overloaded since
   will not maintain sinus
   - will consider anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct drop from 27 to 24 with no obvious
   source. Plt 134 to 108.
   - B12, folate and iron studies normal
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   - transfusion goals Hct>25 (if still has poor Sv02) and plt>50 only if

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was reintubated due to increasing agitation, tachypnea, and hypoxemia despite diuretic therapy. Thoracentesis showed a transudative effusion likely secondary to diastolic congestive heart failure in the setting of atrial fib with RVR. The patient is hypervolemic and will proceed with diuresis today to optimize her pulmonary status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Function: The patient's cardiac output is reduced due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR. Continuous monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) is essential.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The etiology of hypoxic status is most likely from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. Diuretic therapy is being continued to optimize her pulmonary status.
3. Hypotension/Fevers: The patient previously had fevers but is now afebrile for 48 hours. She is receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage, and the current regimen should be continued. Vancomycin levels will be checked before the third dose.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Creatinine levels are stable, suggesting ischemic ATN,"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**]
   diastolic CHF in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed
   too aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was diuresed effectively in last 24 hours,
   -2L. On PSV 5/5 currently with RBSI <100, but becoming more agitated,
   tachycardic and hypertensive on lower sedation.
   - D/C versed/fentanyl and try propofol until extubation attempt in AM
   - attempt to treat agitation with standing antipsychotic if QT interval
   normalized
   - continue lasix gtt as tolerated by BP, goal 2-4L negative today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin and dilt
   - attempt extubation when above factors optimized (tomorrow)
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for >72
   hours.  On vanc, zosyn.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, C. dif negative x 3.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**7-14**]
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine stable. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in
   setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria.  Cont goal of diuresis as above.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will consider renally dosing meds
   .
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Will need
   continued rate control.  Rate control is actually best achieved with
   decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on ventilator.  Etiology of a.
   fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and will not maintain SR if cardioverted
   while still overloaded.
   - cont digoxin and dilt
   - will consider anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, discontinued Swan, converted to triple lumen to
   allow continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct and Plt stable and wnl in past 24 hrs.
   .
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - consider seroquel or zyprexa if QTc wnl
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +22
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions

She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and was re-intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pleural effusions secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient initially experienced aggressive diuresis resulting in hypotension, followed by difficulty responding to Lasix due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and shows a respiratory rate and spontaneous tidal volume within normal limits. The respiratory support is being continued, and efforts are being made to extubate the patient in the morning. If agitation persists, propofol will be tried, and an antipsychotic medication may be considered if the QT interval normalizes.

2. Hypotension/Fevers: The patient had a fever spike but has been afebrile for over 72 hours. She is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Despite being afebrile since starting these medications, they will continue to be administered, and prophylactic antibiotics (acyclovir and Bactrim) will also be continued.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are stable,"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**]
   diastolic CHF in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed
   too aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was diuresed effectively in last 24 hours,
   -2L. On PSV 5/5 currently with RBSI <100, but becoming more agitated,
   tachycardic and hypertensive.
   - continue lasix gtt as tolerated by BP, goal 1L negative today
   - monitor CVP
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin and dilt
   - attempt extubation when above factors optimized
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for >72
   hours.  On vanc, zosyn.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, C. dif negative x 3.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**7-11**]
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine stable. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in
   setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria.  Cont goal of diuresis as above.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will consider renally dosing meds
   .
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Will need
   continued rate control.  Rate control is actually best achieved with
   decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on ventilator.  Etiology of a.
   fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and will not maintain SR if cardioverted
   while still overloaded.
   - cont digoxin and dilt
   - will consider anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, discontinued Swan, converted to triple lumen to
   allow continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct and Plt stable and wnl in past 24 hrs.
   .
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium, now resolved.  Discontinued zyprexa
   given prolonged QT
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +22

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She required reintubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pleural effusions. Thoracentesis showed transudative effusion, likely due to diastolic heart failure. The patient initially experienced hypotension from aggressive diuresis, followed by difficulty responding to Lasix due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative for bacterial, fungal, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). The patient was diuresed effectively in the last 24 hours, with a negative fluid balance of 2 liters. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) below 100, but becoming more agitated, tachycardic, and hypertensive.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The etiology of hypoxic status is likely from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. Thoracentesis suggested a transudative effusion, likely caused by diastolic CHF in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR.

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**]
   diastolic CHF in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed
   too aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was diuresed effectively in last 24 hours,
   -2L. On PSV 5/5 currently with RBSI <100, but becoming more agitated,
   tachycardic and hypertensive on lower sedation.   ?Central cause of
   RSB,  given alkalemia, pCO2 of 37 on SBT.
   - D/C versed/fentanyl and try propofol until extubation attempt in AM,
   - make olanzapine standing.
   - continue lasix gtt as tolerated by BP, goal 2-4L negative today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin and dilt
   - attempt extubation when above factors optimized (tomorrow)
   .
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Will need
   continued rate control.  Rate control is actually best achieved with
   decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on ventilator.  Etiology of a.
   fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and will not maintain SR if cardioverted
   while still overloaded.
   - cont digoxin and increase dilt to 60mg QID
   - Would start anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #Diarrhea:  Patient has been having several days of profuse diarrhea.
Infectious
      NO ENTERIC GRAM NEGATIVE RODS FOUND.
      NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
      NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
      NO CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OR GIARDIA SEEN.
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
Secretory
      Fecal Fat and osms are still pending (have to resend osms)
- Hold tube feeds today to see if this is source of diarrhea, if diarrhea contin
ues despite 24hours off of tube feeds, would d/c abx at this point.
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for >72
   hours.  On vanc, zosyn.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, C. dif negative x 3.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**8-13**]
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim (would ideally like to d/c bactrim if
   ok with heme/onc as patient is nearly a month post transplant and has a
   wbc of 12.)
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine stable. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in
   setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria.  Cont goal of diuresis as above.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will consider renally dosing meds
   - ?hold bactrim
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, discontinued Swan, converted to triple lumen to
   allow continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct and Plt  currently increasing
   .
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - consider seroquel or zyprexa if QTc wnl
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +23
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU due to tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient was initially diuresed too aggressively, resulting in hypotension, and then had difficulty responding to Lasix due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been effectively diuresed in the last 24 hours. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, Vt of 313 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 31, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 95%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 37, HCO3- of 81, Ve of 10.1 L/min, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 205, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed.

   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**]
   diastolic CHF in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed
   too aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was diuresed effectively in last 24 hours,
   -2L. On PSV 5/5 currently with RBSI <100, but becoming more agitated,
   tachycardic and hypertensive on lower sedation.
   - D/C versed/fentanyl and try propofol until extubation attempt in AM
   - attempt to treat agitation with standing antipsychotic if QT interval
   normalized
   - continue lasix gtt as tolerated by BP, goal 2-4L negative today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin and dilt
   - attempt extubation when above factors optimized (tomorrow)

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**]
   diastolic CHF in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed
   too aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was diuresed effectively in last 24 hours,
   -2L. On PSV 5/5 currently with RBSI <100, but becoming more agitated,
   tachycardic and hypertensive on lower sedation.   ?Central cause of
   RSB,  given alkalemia, pCO2 of 37 on SBT.
   - D/C versed/fentanyl and try propofol until extubation attempt in AM,
   - make olanzapine standing.
   - continue lasix gtt as tolerated by BP, goal 2-4L negative today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin and dilt
   - attempt extubation when above factors optimized (tomorrow)
   .
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Will need
   continued rate control.  Rate control is actually best achieved with
   decreased agitation, sedation.  Improved on ventilator.  Etiology of a.
   fib likely [**3-8**] atrial stretch and will not maintain SR if cardioverted
   while still overloaded.
   - cont digoxin and increase dilt to 60mg QID
   - Would start anti-coag with warfarin when HCT has clearly stabilized
   .
   #Diarrhea:  Patient has been having several days of profuse diarrhea.
Infectious
      NO ENTERIC GRAM NEGATIVE RODS FOUND.
      NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
      NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
      NO CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OR GIARDIA SEEN.
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
Secretory
      Fecal Fat and osms are still pending (have to resend osms)
   .
   #. Hypotension/Fevers: Patient respiked fever but now afebrile for >72
   hours.  On vanc, zosyn.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, C. dif negative x 3.
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**8-13**]
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine stable. Likely ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in
   setting of probable sepsis, diuresis, hypotension, possible additive
   component of contrast-induced nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely
   since no proteinuria.  Cont goal of diuresis as above.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - will consider renally dosing meds
   - ?hold bactrim
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, discontinued Swan, converted to triple lumen to
   allow continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #  Anemia/thrombocytopenia- Hct and Plt  currently increasing
   .
   #. Altered mental status:
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - consider seroquel or zyprexa if QTc wnl
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +23
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. She was initially diuresed too aggressively, resulting in hypotension, and then had difficulty responding to Lasix due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). BAL results were negative for bacterial, fungal, and PCP. The patient has been successfully diuresed in the last 24 hours, and her respiratory status is improving. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and her respiratory system instability index (RSBI) is less than 100. However, she is becoming more agitated, tachycardic, and hypertensive on lower sedation. It is unclear if there is a central cause of her respiratory system instability, given the alkalemia and pCO2 of 37 on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Propofol has been started until extubation attempt in the morning.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and a CHADS2 score of 2. She will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control is best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation, and improved ventilation. Digoxin and diltiazem have been continued, and the dose of diltiazem has been increased to 60 mg Q"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated with continued altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**]
   diastolic CHF in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed
   too aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was diuresed aggresively in last 24 hours,
   -4.2L. On PSV 10/5 currently with RBSI <100.   Barrier to extubation is
   mental status.
   - cont olanzapine standing.
   - hold lasix gtt since 4.2L neg (LOS 1.5 neg) and increasing BUN/Cr
   today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin and dilt
   - attempt extubation
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Seems to have started with chemo induction,
   no clear etiology. s/p LP, MRI, infectious w/u all negative. Repeat
   head CT neg yesterday.
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - consider zyprexa and monitor QTc
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Patient afebrile for >72 hours with increasing
   Leukocytosis. On vanc, zosyn.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric
   [**Last Name (un) **].  No positive cx, including stool studies. Head ct shows mastoid
   process.
   - consider ENT consult for mastoiditis
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**9-13**]
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control
   is best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.
   - cont digoxin and dilt to 90mg QID
   - Would start anti-coag with warfarin when mental status issues
   resolved
   .
   #Diarrhea:  Patient has been having several days of profuse diarrhea.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-8**] TF, however have already been held 24 hours and no
   improvement. All infectious studies negative.
   - f/u fecal fat/osm
   ..
   #  ARF- Creatinine rising today with aggressive diuresis. Likely
   ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in setting of probable sepsis, diuresis,
   hypotension, possible additive component of contrast-induced
   nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely since no proteinuria.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - [**Name (NI) **] dosing meds
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, discontinued Swan, converted to triple lumen to
   allow continued monitoring of CVP.

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been re-intubated and continues to have altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic status is likely due to pleural effusions causing shunting through atelectatic lung. Thoracentesis showed a transudative effusion, likely secondary to diastolic heart failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was initially over-diuresed, resulting in hypotension, and then had difficulty responding to Lasix due to acute tubular necrosis. BAL results were negative for bacterial, fungal, and PCP infection. 

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status started to deteriorate after chemotherapy induction, but no clear etiology has been identified. A lumbar puncture, MRI, infectious workup, and repeat head CT were all negative. The most consistent diagnosis is delirium. 

3. Leukocytosis: The patient is afebrile for over 72 hours with increasing leukocytosis. She is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. She had a course of daptomycin for a urinary tract infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated with continued altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Etiology of hypoxic status most likely
   from pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic
   lung.  Thoracentesis suggested transudative effusion, likely [**3-8**]
   diastolic CHF in setting of a. fib with RVR. Pt was intially diuresed
   too aggressively with resulting hypotension, and then had difficulty
   responding to Lasix in setting of ATN.  BAL results neg for bacterial,
   fungal and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was diuresed aggresively in last 24 hours,
   -4.2L. On PSV 10/5 currently with RBSI <100.   Barrier to extubation is
   mental status.
   - cont olanzapine standing.
   - hold lasix gtt since 4.2L neg (LOS 1.5 neg) and increasing BUN/Cr
   today
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin and dilt
   - attempt extubation
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Seems to have started with chemo induction,
   no clear etiology. s/p LP, MRI, infectious w/u all negative. Repeat
   head CT neg yesterday.
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - consider zyprexa and monitor QTc
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Patient afebrile for >72 hours with increasing
   Leukocytosis. On vanc, zosyn.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric
   [**Last Name (un) **].  No positive cx, including stool studies. Head ct shows mastoid
   process.
   - consider ENT consult for mastoiditis
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**9-13**]
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control
   is best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.
   - cont digoxin and dilt to 90mg QID
   - Would start anti-coag with warfarin when mental status issues
   resolved
   .
   #Diarrhea:  Patient has been having several days of profuse diarrhea.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-8**] TF, however have already been held 24 hours and no
   improvement. All infectious studies negative.
   - f/u fecal fat/osm
   ..
   #  ARF- Creatinine rising today with aggressive diuresis. Likely
   ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in setting of probable sepsis, diuresis,
   hypotension, possible additive component of contrast-induced
   nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely since no proteinuria.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - [**Name (NI) **] dosing meds
   .
   #. Cardiac Function- Cardiac output measured with PA catheter ~3, with
   CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Patient may have reduced forward flow
   due to absent atrial kick and diastolic CHF in AF with RVR, no overt
   left heart failure. Off pressors.
   Given conflicting data, discontinued Swan, converted to triple lumen to
   allow continued monitoring of CVP.
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +24
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was re-intubated due to continued altered mental status.

The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely caused by pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. Thoracentesis showed a transudative effusion, likely due to diastolic congestive heart failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was initially diuresed too aggressively, resulting in hypotension, and then had difficulty responding to Lasix in the setting of acute tubular necrosis. BAL results were negative for bacterial, fungal, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which may be due to a urinary tract infection. However, the patient is afebrile and has already been treated with antibiotics. There is a concern for mastoiditis, so an ENT consult is recommended. The patient's altered mental status started during chemotherapy induction and no clear etiology has been identified. Repeat head CT was negative yesterday, and most consistent with delirium.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be controlled with digoxin and diltiazem. The patient's creatinine is rising today, likely due to aggressive di"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She was re-intubated due to continued altered mental status.

2. The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely caused by pleural effusions with secondary shunting through atelectatic lung. The proposed hypothesis is diastolic dysfunction with severely stiff and small left ventricle (LV), leading to insufficient preload and overload resulting in pulmonary edema. The patient was aggressively diuresed in the last 24 hours, with a total output of -4.2L. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 10/5 and has a respiratory system compliance (RBSI) less than 100.

3. The patient's mental status is tenuous, and her cardiac status is a barrier to extubation. She is being controlled with olanzapine for agitation. If extubation is not attempted today, diuresis will be less aggressive since there is an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine (Cr) ratio today. The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR will be controlled with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. She has altered mental status and is being aggressively diuresed. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, leading to pulmonary edema. Diastolic dysfunction with severely stiff and small LV, insufficient preload, and overload are contributing factors.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status started with chemotherapy induction and there is no clear etiology. Infectious workup and head CT were negative. It is most consistent with delirium.
3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient is afebrile for >72 hours. She is on vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage. A course of daptomycin was given for a urinary tract infection. No positive cultures were found, including stool studies. Head CT shows mastoid process. An ENT consult for mastoiditis is being considered.

   resulting pulmonary edema   Patient was diuresed aggresively [**Location 12653**]4L.
   On PSV 10/5 currently with RBSI <100.   Barrier to extubation is mental
   status and tenuous cardiac status, will continue to diurese
   pre-extubation given loss of PEEP.

   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control
   is best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.

   Critical Care
   Present for the key portions of the resident
s history and exam. Agree
   with assessment and plan as outlined during multidisciplinary rounds
   this morning. She has continued to diurese overnight and is now
   substantially negative for her ICU LOS.  Her RSBI was better than it
   has been since reintubation. When off Propofol she is alert and seems
   calm.  We extubated her this afternoon and she has done well
   signif SOB, SaO2 good, HR RR in good range. We are continuing to
   diureses and will try to correct her electrolytes. Hopefully will do
   weel but if she fails current plan is for reintubation and then trache.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

2. The patient underwent reintubation due to continued altered mental status. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at 10 cmH2O pressure support, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a respiratory system resistance compliance index (RSBI) of 69.

3. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (normal range: 77-103 bpm), blood pressure of 145/65 mmHg (normal range: 86-158/49-74 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (normal range: 13-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

4. The patient has been aggressively diuresed, resulting in a negative fluid balance. This has led to improved respiratory status and reduced bilateral pleural effusions.

5. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to delirium, possibly caused by chemotherapy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. She was re-intubated due to continued altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, leukocytosis/fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, diarrhea, acute renal failure, and cardiac dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, leading to hypoxia. Diuretics have been used to manage this condition.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits delirium-like symptoms, which may be caused by chemotherapy induction, sepsis, or other factors. Antipsychotic medications like olanzapine and zyprexa have been considered to manage agitation.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: Despite being afebrile for over 72 hours, the patient initially had leukocytosis and fever. Antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, have been administered empirically. Further evaluation for infectious causes is ongoing.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has had multiple episodes of AFib with RVR. Rate control has been attempted"

   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated with continued altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt has unchanged bilateral pleural.
   Our hypothesis is diastolic dysfunction with severely stiff and small
   LV, and tenuous balance between insufficient preload and overload with
   resulting pulmonary edema   Patient was diuresed aggresively [**Location 12653**]4L.
   On PSV 10/5 currently with RBSI <100.   Barrier to extubation has been
   mental status and tenuous cardiac status, continued to diurese
   pre-extubation given loss of PEEP.  Extubated yesterday without
   incident.  Ongoing discussion with patient, family, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**] re:
   plan if patient fails again.
   - cont olanzapine standing for agitation
   - goal Is/Os even today
   - control AF with RVR with dilt IV
   - will likely need NG ast pt not taking PO [**3-8**] to mental status
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Seems to have started with chemo induction,
   no clear etiology. s/p LP, MRI, infectious w/u all negative. Repeat
   head CT neg yesterday.
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - consider zyprexa and monitor QTc
   .
   #  Hct drop- No evidence of hemorrhage on exam.  Will recheck Hct,
   coags, eval for hemolysis if Hct cont to be low.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis/Fever: Patient afebrile for >72 hours. On vanc, zosyn
   for empiric coverage.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, including stool studies. Head ct shows mastoid process.
   - consider ENT consult for mastoiditis, otoscopic exam today
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**10-14**]
   - check vancomycin trough and hold AM dose if >20
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control
   is best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.
   - cont digoxin and dilt to 90mg QID
   - check dig level
   - if extubated and not taking PO
s, consider dilt gtt
   - Would start anti-coag with warfarin when mental status issues
   resolved
   .
   #Diarrhea:  Patient has been having several days of profuse diarrhea.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-8**] TF, however have already been held 24 hours and no
   improvement. All infectious studies negative (c dif neg x 3). Most
   likely [**3-8**] bowel wall edema since improving with diuresis.
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine rising today with aggressive diuresis. Likely
   ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in setting of probable sepsis, diuresis,
   hypotension, possible additive component of contrast-induced
   nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely since no proteinuria.
   Worsened with aggressive diuresis, now stabilized. Tolerating [**Last Name (un) **] to
   achieve optimal diuresis for extubation.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - [**Name (NI) **] dosing meds
   .
   #. Cardiac Function (MR, pulm HTN)- Cardiac output measured with PA
   catheter ~3, with CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Repeat TTE showed
   worsened high output state, with very small LVH and LVTO. Likely LV
   very stiff and acting like severe diastolic dysfunction.
   - diuresed aggressively, reflected in improved respiratory status
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +25
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, currently in the ICU with altered mental status and hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been intubated multiple times, most recently yesterday without incident. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, hypertension, and multiple myeloma. She is also experiencing altered mental status, diarrhea, fever of unknown origin, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, indicated by her hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a concern for ongoing fluid overload, as evidenced by her pleural effusion and the need for aggressive diuresis. Continuous monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been altered since the initiation of chemotherapy, and no clear etiology has been identified. Monitoring her mental status closely is crucial to detect any potential changes or worsening delirium.
3. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with evidence of diastolic dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. These cardiac issues contribute to her respiratory distress and may necessitate further interventions such as cardiac catheterization or medications to optimize cardiac output.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated with continued altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt has unchanged bilateral pleural.
   Our hypothesis is diastolic dysfunction with severely stiff and small
   LV, and tenuous balance between insufficient preload and overload with
   resulting pulmonary edema   Patient was diuresed aggresively [**Location 12653**]4L.
   On PSV 10/5 currently with RBSI <100.   Barrier to extubation has been
   mental status and tenuous cardiac status, continued to diurese
   pre-extubation given loss of PEEP.  Extubated yesterday without
   incident.  Ongoing discussion with patient, family, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**] re:
   plan if patient fails again.
   - haldol PRN for agitation
   - goal Is/Os even today
   - control AF with RVR with dilt IV and digoxin PO, if cont to take good
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] restart dilt PO
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Seems to have started with chemo induction,
   no clear etiology. s/p LP, MRI, infectious w/u all negative. Repeat
   head CT neg yesterday.
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - haldol as above
   .
   #  Hct drop- No evidence of hemorrhage on exam.  Will recheck Hct,
   coags, eval for hemolysis if Hct cont to be low.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis/Fever: Patient afebrile for >72 hours. On vanc, zosyn
   for empiric coverage.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, including stool studies. Head ct shows mastoid process
   - will d/c vanc/zosyn today, course completed
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control
   is best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.
   - cont digoxin and dilt to 90mg QID
   - check dig level
   - Would start anti-coag with warfarin as mental status continues to
   clear
   .
   #Diarrhea:  Patient has been having several days of profuse diarrhea.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-8**] TF, however have already been held 24 hours and no
   improvement. All infectious studies negative (c dif neg x 3). Most
   likely [**3-8**] bowel wall edema since improving with diuresis.
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine rising today with aggressive diuresis. Likely
   ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in setting of probable sepsis, diuresis,
   hypotension, possible additive component of contrast-induced
   nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely since no proteinuria.
   Worsened with aggressive diuresis, now stabilized. Tolerating [**Last Name (un) **] to
   achieve optimal diuresis for extubation.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - [**Name (NI) **] dosing meds
   .
   #. Cardiac Function (MR, pulm HTN)- Cardiac output measured with PA
   catheter ~3, with CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Repeat TTE showed
   worsened high output state, with very small LVH and LVTO. Likely LV
   very stiff and acting like severe diastolic dysfunction.
   - diuresed aggressively, reflected in improved respiratory status
   - goal even today
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +25
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Ms [**Known lastname 12343**] and reviewed her historical, lab, and
   imaging data.  I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9827**]
s note above and agree with his
   findings and plan of care.  Ms [**Known lastname 12343**] was extubated yesterday following
   hypoxemic resp failure felt due to CHF from agitation, tachycardia, and
   flash pulm edema.   She has diuresed nicely and now can be maintained
   I=O.  Her empiric antibiotics are being stopped and her meds will be
   switched as much as possible to oral.  While her mental status is still
   not normal, it is improved compared to prior and we will allow her to
   sit up, eat, etc as we get her ready to go to the floor sometime in the
   next 24 hrs.  Her Hct did fall yesterday, without clear cause, so close
   Hct monitoring is in order.
   35 min spent in this patient

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who presented to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response earlier in the hospital course. She was re-intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by bilateral pleural effusion, diastolic dysfunction with severely stiff and small left ventricle, and tenuous balance between insufficient preload and overload resulting in pulmonary edema. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to delirium, possibly triggered by chemotherapy induction, with no clear etiology. Infectious workup and head CT have been negative. The patient has leukocytosis and fever, but has been afebrile for over 72 hours. She has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam empirically, and these antibiotics will be discontinued today as her course is complete. Acyclovir and Bactrim will be continued.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being controlled with digoxin and diltiazem. She has a CHADS2 score of 2 (age and hypertension), so she will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control is best achieved with decreased agitation and sedation.

The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which is likely due to bowel wall edema. All infectious studies have been negative, and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and refractory episodes of AFib. She has been intubated multiple times, most recently due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and she also has pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, hypertension, and multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to her underlying conditions, such as diastolic dysfunction and stiff, small left ventricle.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may deteriorate further, potentially leading to delirium or other cognitive impairments.
3. Leukocytosis/Fever: Although the patient has been afebrile for over 72 hours, there is still a risk of infection, and the underlying cause of her fever remains unidentified.
4. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient's mitral regurgitation may worsen, leading to further cardiac dysfunction.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's AFib with RVR could progress, increasing the risk of complications like stroke or heart failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure and has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has acute pleural effusion, which can lead to compromised lung expansion and impaired oxygenation. This condition requires prompt management to prevent complications like infection or tension pneumothorax.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension (Pulm HTN, PHTN): The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which increases the risk of right heart strain and failure. This condition needs to be closely monitored for potential complications like cor pulmonale or pulmonary edema.

4. Mitral Regurgitation (Mitral Insufficiency): The patient has mitral regurgitation, which may contribute to heart failure symptoms and increase the risk of pulmonary edema or arrhythmias.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, or heart failure. Managing this condition is crucial to prevent complications.

6. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to various causes such as sepsis, hyp"

   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated with continued altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt has unchanged bilateral pleural.
   Our hypothesis is diastolic dysfunction with severely stiff and small
   LV, and tenuous balance between insufficient preload and overload with
   resulting pulmonary edema   Patient was diuresed aggresively [**Location 12653**]4L.
   On PSV 10/5 currently with RBSI <100.   Barrier to extubation has been
   mental status and tenuous cardiac status, continued to diurese
   pre-extubation given loss of PEEP.  Extubated yesterday without
   incident.  Ongoing discussion with patient, family, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**] re:
   plan if patient fails again.
   - haldol PRN for agitation
   - goal Is/Os even today
   - control AF with RVR with dilt IV and digoxin PO, if cont to take good
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] restart dilt PO
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Seems to have started with chemo induction,
   no clear etiology. s/p LP, MRI, infectious w/u all negative. Repeat
   head CT neg yesterday.
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - haldol as above
   .
   #  Hct drop- No evidence of hemorrhage on exam.  Will recheck Hct,
   coags, eval for hemolysis if Hct cont to be low.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis/Fever: Patient afebrile for >72 hours. On vanc, zosyn
   for empiric coverage.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, including stool studies. Head ct shows mastoid process
   - will d/c vanc/zosyn today, course completed
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control
   is best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.
   - cont digoxin and dilt to 90mg QID
   - check dig level
   - Would start anti-coag with warfarin as mental status continues to
   clear
   .
   #Diarrhea:  Patient has been having several days of profuse diarrhea.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-8**] TF, however have already been held 24 hours and no
   improvement. All infectious studies negative (c dif neg x 3). Most
   likely [**3-8**] bowel wall edema since improving with diuresis.
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine rising today with aggressive diuresis. Likely
   ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in setting of probable sepsis, diuresis,
   hypotension, possible additive component of contrast-induced
   nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely since no proteinuria.
   Worsened with aggressive diuresis, now stabilized. Tolerating [**Last Name (un) **] to
   achieve optimal diuresis for extubation.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - [**Name (NI) **] dosing meds

   #. Cardiac Function (MR, pulm HTN)- Cardiac output measured with PA
   catheter ~3, with CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Repeat TTE showed
   worsened high output state, with very small LVH and LVTO. Likely LV
   very stiff and acting like severe diastolic dysfunction.
   - diuresed aggressively, reflected in improved respiratory status
   - goal even today
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +25
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. She was re-intubated due to continued altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, acute pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, diarrhea, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, hypertension, and multiple myeloma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's bilateral pleural effusion and diastolic dysfunction with a small and stiff left ventricle may lead to insufficient preload and overload, resulting in pulmonary edema.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status started to change with chemotherapy induction, but no clear etiology has been identified. It could be consistent with delirium.
3. Hct Drop: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased, which may indicate hemorrhage, hemolysis, or other causes. Further evaluation is needed.
4. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient initially had leukocytosis and fever, but is now afebrile for over 72 hours. She was treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam empirically, but these medications may be discontinued as her infectious work"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated with continued altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Pt has unchanged bilateral pleural.
   Our hypothesis is diastolic dysfunction with severely stiff and small
   LV, and tenuous balance between insufficient preload and overload with
   resulting pulmonary edema   Patient was diuresed aggresively [**Location 12653**]4L.
   On PSV 10/5 currently with RBSI <100.   Barrier to extubation is mental
   status and tenuous cardiac status, will continue to diurese
   pre-extubation given loss of PEEP.
   - cont olanzapine standing for agitation
   - continue lasix gtt until extubation then back off
   - control AF with RVR with digoxin and dilt
   - attempt extubation today, address with family goals of care if
   failure
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Seems to have started with chemo induction,
   no clear etiology. s/p LP, MRI, infectious w/u all negative. Repeat
   head CT neg yesterday.
   Most consistent with delirium.
   - consider zyprexa and monitor QTc
   .
   #  Hct drop- No evidence of hemorrhage on exam.  Will recheck Hct,
   coags, eval for hemolysis if Hct cont to be low.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis/Fever: Patient afebrile for >72 hours. On vanc, zosyn
   for empiric coverage.  s/p course of dapto for UTI, empiric [**Last Name (un) **].  No
   positive cx, including stool studies. Head ct shows mastoid process.
   - consider ENT consult for mastoiditis, otoscopic exam today
   - cont current regimen as patient has been afebrile since starting,
   today day [**10-14**]
   - check vancomycin trough and hold AM dose if >20
   - cont ppx acyclovir and Bactrim
   .
   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so she
   will eventually require consideration for anticoagulation. Rate control
   is best achieved with decreased agitation, sedation.
   - cont digoxin and dilt to 90mg QID
   - check dig level
   - if extubated and not taking PO
s, consider dilt gtt
   - Would start anti-coag with warfarin when mental status issues
   resolved
   .
   #Diarrhea:  Patient has been having several days of profuse diarrhea.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-8**] TF, however have already been held 24 hours and no
   improvement. All infectious studies negative (c dif neg x 3). Most
   likely [**3-8**] bowel wall edema since improving with diuresis.
   .
   #  ARF- Creatinine rising today with aggressive diuresis. Likely
   ischemic ATN, multifactorial, in setting of probable sepsis, diuresis,
   hypotension, possible additive component of contrast-induced
   nephropathy. Amlyoid/myeloma less likely since no proteinuria.
   Worsened with aggressive diuresis, now stabilized. Tolerating [**Last Name (un) **] to
   achieve optimal diuresis for extubation.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - no indication for RRT
   - [**Name (NI) **] dosing meds
   .
   #. Cardiac Function (MR, pulm HTN)- Cardiac output measured with PA
   catheter ~3, with CI near 2-2.5. SVO2 40s-50s%.  Repeat TTE showed
   worsened high output state, with very small LVH and LVTO. Likely LV
   very stiff and acting like severe diastolic dysfunction.
   - diuresed aggressively, reflected in improved respiratory status
   .
   #. Multiple Myeloma s/p now stem cell transplant:
   Patient is SCT day +25
   - Appreciate BMT team input into further management
   - Transplant precautions

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma who presented to the ICU with tachycardia and refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation. She was re-intubated due to respiratory failure and continues to have altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has unchanged bilateral pleural effusion, which may lead to continued respiratory distress and further hypoxia.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is still tenuous, and there is no clear etiology for the altered mental status. It could be due to delirium or other causes.

3. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing profuse diarrhea, which may be related to bowel wall edema and diuretic use.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating a possible acute kidney injury, which could be due to ischemic ATN, diuresis, hypotension, or contrast-induced nephropathy.

5. Cardiac Function: The patient has mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and a small left ventricle, leading to diastolic dysfunction. These cardiac issues may contribute to her overall poor prognosis.

6. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient initially had leukocytosis and fever, but is now afebrile"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is now re-intubated and continues to have altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, Hct drop, leukocytosis/fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, diarrhea, acute renal failure, and cardiac dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's bilateral pleural effusion may be causing pulmonary edema, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure. Aggressive diuresis was given, but barrier to extubation remains mental status and tenuous cardiac status.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely due to delirium, possibly triggered by chemotherapy induction. No clear etiology has been identified, and infectious workup has been negative.
3. Hct Drop: The patient's hematocrit level has dropped without evidence of hemorrhage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including rechecking the Hct, coagulation profile, and evaluation for hemolysis.
4. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient initially had leukocytosis and fever, but is now afebrile. Empiric antibiotics were started, and the source of"

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma who presented to the ICU with tachycardia to 180s in the setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) earlier in the hospital course. She has been re-intubated with continued altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: The patient has unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, which may lead to difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation. Diastolic dysfunction with severely stiff and small left ventricle (LV), along with a tenuous balance between insufficient preload and overload, can result in pulmonary edema. Aggressive diuresis has been administered to manage this condition.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status seems to have started with chemotherapy induction, with no clear etiology. A lumbar puncture (LP), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and infectious workup have all been negative. A repeat head CT was negative yesterday. This most likely indicates delirium, for which haldol (haloperidol) has been prescribed.

3. Hct drop: There is no evidence of hemorrhage on examination, but the patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped. Further evaluation for hemolysis will be done if the Hct continues to be low.

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma,
   presented to ICU with tachycardia to 180s in setting of multiple
   refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital
   course.   Now re-intubated with continued altered mental status.

   LV, and tenuous balance between insufficient preload and overload with
   resulting pulmonary edema   Patient was diuresed aggresively [**Location 12653**]7L.
   On PSV 10/5 currently with RBSI <100.   Barrier to extubation had been
   mental status and tenuous cardiac status, continued to diurese
   pre-extubation given loss of PEEP.  Extubated yesterday without
   incident.  Ongoing discussion with patient, family, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**] re:
   plan if patient fails again.  In terms of preventing re-intubation:
   will keep her negative daily with PM prn lasix, will control SBP with
   captopril, will convert HR control from dilt to metopr. d/c dig.

   and agree with his findings and plan of care.
   The patient looks more calm and appropriate today. No resp distress,
   though she still has crackles up 30% of the way from her bases, and her
   SBP was 160 this AM.  She converted to NSR on her own last evening, and
   hopefully this will give her a better atrial kick. We will modify her
   cardiac regimen somewhat to keep her mildly diuresed as well as rate
   and BP controlled. She is stable enough to be called out but no bed
   currently available.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent aggressive diuresis and was extubated without incident. However, she re-intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and continued altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications to control her heart rate, blood pressure, and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's bilateral pleural effusion may lead to pulmonary edema, causing difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, which could be due to delirium or another underlying cause. This can increase the risk of complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, and infections.
3. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's small and stiff left ventricle may result in diastolic dysfunction, leading to poor cardiac output and subsequent organ hypoperfusion.
4. Leukocytosis/Fever: Although the patient is currently afebrile, leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is important.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest ARF, likely due"

   #. Afib with RVR:  CHADS2 score is 2 (age and hypertension), so and she
   is currently flipping in and out AFIB. I would favor anti-coagulation
   at this point.  We are attemtping rate control with metoprolol at this
   point given her underlying diastolic CHF.
   -Restarted digoxin while in AFIB
   - Consider Increasing metoprolol to 100 if resting HR

   be to treat  her diastolic chf with metoprolol and digoxin for rate
   control, ace inhibitors for afterload reduction, and low dose lasix for
   preload control.  Also we
ll restart olanzepine for her agitation and
   sundowning, which contribute to her tachycardia.  Overall, however, she

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, who presented to the ICU with tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. She had episodes of rapid ventricular response earlier in the hospital course. The patient is currently on digoxin, metoprolol, and diltiazem for rate control. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin and captopril for blood pressure control.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to ICU delirium, and she is receiving haloperidol for agitation. Diarrhea has been present for several days, but all infectious studies have been negative. The patient's renal function is improving, with a falling creatinine level.

Cardiac function assessment shows a high-output state with a small left ventricle and diastolic dysfunction. The patient is being aggressively diuresed and is extubated. The goal is to prevent hypoxic respiratory failure by maintaining a slightly negative fluid balance and controlling blood pressure with captopril. The patient's multiple myeloma status is being managed by the BMT team.

Potential medical complications:
1. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and episodes of rapid ventricular response indicate potential arrhythmic complications. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and appropriate management with antiarrhythmic medications will be necessary.
2. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's small left ventricle and"

   dilt to metopr  and dig.
   - Zydis prn for agitation

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma. She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been diagnosed with diastolic heart failure and severely stiff and small left ventricle. The patient's altered mental status started during chemo induction, and no clear etiology has been identified. Infectious workup and head CT were negative. She has also been experiencing diarrhea, which is likely due to bowel wall edema. Her renal function is improving, and she has undergone stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and diastolic heart failure. There is a risk of further cardiac complications such as worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary edema, there is a risk of respiratory failure. Extubation may be attempted, but the patient may require reintubation if respiratory distress occurs.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) likely due to ischemic ATN, contrast-induced nephropathy, and myeloma kidney. There is a risk of ongoing renal dysfunction or deterioration.
4. Infectious Complications: Although initial infectious workup was negative,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and multiple myeloma.
- She presented to the ICU with tachycardia and multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
- The patient's CHADS2 score is 2, indicating a moderate risk for stroke. She is currently flipping in and out of atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation has been initiated.
- Rate control is being attempted with metoprolol.
- The patient's underlying diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) is also being managed.
- She was aggressively diuresed and successfully extubated yesterday without incident.
- The patient's negative daily fluid balance is being maintained with daily PM prn lasix, controlled systolic blood pressure with captopril, conversion of heart rate control from diltiazem to metoprolol, and conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm.
- The patient has an altered mental status, which started after chemotherapy induction. No clear etiology has been identified, but repeat head CT and MRI were negative. ICU delirium is suspected, and zydis may be a better option than haldol.
- The patient has been experiencing diarrhea for several days, which is likely due to bowel wall edema since it is improving with diuresis."
