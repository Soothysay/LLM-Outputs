   Assessment and Plan
   /P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, try on PS first
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - d/c HCO3 and correct acid base disturbance with vent support
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance with vent
   - d/c HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   - When stable, get renal U/S to r/o obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - start meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - Continue on BB first then diltiazem, hydralazine with holding
   parameters
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed
   .
   # PPx: PPI, heparin subq, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: A discussion was had the with patient's HCPs, her daughter and
   son.  We specifically said that she had refused dialysis and TFs on her
   previous admission when she was more awake, but her family
   (particularly her son) wants to ""do everything.""  We specifically
   addressed putting her on the ventilator, which we all agree would not
   cause her any discomfort given she already had a trach.  However, I
   explained that if her heart stopped, or she went into a non-perfusing
   heart rhythm, she would likely not survive this.  Her son wanted CPR
   despite my explanation that she would likely never become conscious and
   her organs would fail further, her daughter is undecided.  They will
   have a family discussion about this was we will readdress this, but I
   did express that I think CPR would not be indicated.  I also explained
   that this does not mean that we would not be aggressive with other
   aspects of her care including antibiotics, putting her on the
   ventilator and considering dialysis if it was deemed necessary by
   nephrology .

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic kidney disease, COPD, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acute renal failure, and chronic respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI), small bowel obstruction (SBO), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD has led to chronic respiratory failure, which is now exacerbated by acute respiratory distress due to infection and renal failure. She requires mechanical ventilation support.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has experienced a worsening of renal function, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and possibly obstructive uropathy. Dialysis has been discussed but is not currently deemed necessary.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of resistant infections and is currently being treated for a UTI caused by Enterobacter, which is sensitive to meropenem.
4. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has partial SBO, which is likely contributing to her altered mental status and abdominal distension. She is being managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   /P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status post tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and altered mental status. She was admitted to the ICU with a urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. The patient's current conditions include acute on chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, UTI, and altered mental status. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate 96 bpm, blood pressure 111/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%. She is receiving ventilatory support with a tracheostomy and is on assist-control (AC) mode to help with her metabolic acidosis. Her urine output is poor.

The patient has a history of multiple infections, including MRSA bacteremia, and has been resistant to some antibiotics. She has also had a positive urine culture with Enterobacter, which is sensitive to meropenem. She is currently being treated with meropenem for the UTI.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and low potassium levels. Her blood glucose levels have been within normal limits. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed troponin elevation,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old individual with chronic respiratory and renal failure. They were admitted to the ICU due to worsening mental status, respiratory distress, and acidosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/49 to 127/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.18, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 116 mEq/L, base excess of -15, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 387. The patient's peripheral pulses are diminished on both arms and absent in both distal pulses. Crackles are heard at the bases of both lungs bilaterally. The patient is obese and has poor dentition. Extremities show edema, and the skin is warm. Neurological examination reveals no attention, poor following of simple commands, and response to verbal stimuli. 

Laboratory findings include hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.6 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 12.0 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 465 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 6.1 to 7.4 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 66 and 80 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 76 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 7.6 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 59 mg/dL. 

The patient's medical history includes chronic respiratory failure, renal failure, allergies to captopril, gabapentin, shellfish, NSAIDs, promethazine, valproate sodium, and hyperammonemia. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation and received meropenem for suspected enterobacter infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and COPD, exacerbation of chronic renal failure, leukocytosis/UTI, poor mental status possibly due to toxic-metabolic reasons, and hypertension. The patient requires ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new

   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP

   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status post tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute renal failure. She was originally admitted to the ICU with altered mental status found to have urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. She is now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator support due to acute on chronic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory condition is worsening, likely due to secondary factors such as renal failure and COPD exacerbation. She is not moving much air, indicating potential issues with ventilation and oxygenation. Continuous monitoring and appropriate ventilation strategies should be implemented.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 7.0. This indicates possible acute kidney injury (AKI) or further deterioration of pre-existing CKD. Close monitoring of renal function and acid-base balance is necessary. Dialysis has been discussed but not urgently needed yet. Regular evaluation of electrolyte levels and fluid balance is crucial.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of bad panresistant infections and currently has a positive urine culture with Enterobacter sensitive to meropenum. Continued antibiotic therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on
   chronic multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. Likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, poor
   nutrition.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Address nutritional status with family re desire for feeding tube
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of renal failure
   Cr now 7.5. Likely related to ATN during previous episodes of
   hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN. Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
 discuss future HD with family
 felt it
   will like not alter long-term outcome given multiorgan system failure
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - renal US negative for obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are acute renal failure (ARF), urinary tract infection (UTI), and respiratory failure. The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status post tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and altered mental status. The patient was initially admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, UTI, partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. 

The patient's recent events include a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (ECG), improvement in acidosis as seen on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, and encephalopathy preventing her from providing a medical history.

In terms of allergies, the patient is allergic to captopril, Neurontin (oral gabapentin), shellfish, NSAIDs, promethazine, and valproate sodium.

The patient has been receiving various medications including meropenem antibiotics, which were discontinued on [**2139-7-26**] at 05:40 PM. She is currently on multiple ICU medications, other medications, and infusions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
- Heart rate: 99 bpm (94-101)

   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status post tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and originally admitted to the ICU with altered mental status found to have urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. She is now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator support.

The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic respiratory failure, UTI, CKD, and altered mental status. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 138/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has multiple lab abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging studies show multiple small cysts in both kidneys, which are largely unchanged from the prior examination. There is no hydronephrosis or stones. The chest x-ray shows no significant change since the prior study, with no pneumonia or failure currently seen. The heart remains somewhat enlarged.

The patient's medications include albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed, prednisone 60mg daily for long-term taper, meropenem for presumed UTI, and trileptal for seizures."

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure, acute on chronic renal failure, alt mental status,
   worsening metabolic acidosis.
   Treated empirically for COPD exacerbation- on prednisone 60 mg daily.
   CHF doesn't seem to be major component based on exam, cxr.
   Renal failure - no acute indication for dialysis but oliguric.
   Need family meeting to address multiple organ failures which are acute
   on chronic.
   Poor nutrition- pt refused feeding tube in the past and has had very
   poor PO intake over the past few weeks. Has feeding tube but pt has
   refused tube feeds, refused PEG, refused placement of dobhoff. Will
   discuss with family and determine feeding plan today.
   Meropenem for UTI.
   Partial SBO, good bowel sounds.
   Need family meeting- will also try to include Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 616**] and renal
   service.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic respiratory and renal failure, worsening mental status, respiratory distress, and poor urine output. The patient has a history of COPD, chronic renal failure, chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, diabetes mellitus, prior pulmonary embolism, and multiple abdominal surgeries for small bowel obstruction/hematoma.

The patient is currently unresponsive and on mechanical ventilation. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/74 to 107/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance with total input of 720 mL and total output of 73 mL. The respiratory support parameters show a set tidal volume of 541 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note.

The lab results show elevated levels of hemoglobin (7.9 g/dL), leukocyte count (43000/uL), creatinine (6.3 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (103 mg/dL), potassium (7.5 mEq/L), sodium (133 mEq/L), chloride (24.0%), magnesium (2.6 mg/dL), and phosphorus (6.6 mg/dL). The glucose levels vary between 66 mg/dL and 112 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, worsening metabolic acidosis, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient is being treated empirically for a COPD exacerbation with prednisone 60 mg daily. There is no indication for acute dialysis, but the patient is oliguric. A family meeting is needed to address multiple organ failures, poor nutrition, and feeding plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute kidney injury or worsening renal failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances (such as hyperkalemia), and potential infections due to the use of a feeding tube. Additionally, the patient's mental status may continue to deteriorate if the underlying cause is not identified and addressed promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Multiorgan failure: Resp failure, acute on chronic renal failure, alt
   mental status, worsening metabolic acidosis, coagulopathic, SBO.
   Treated empirically for COPD exacerbation- on prednisone 60 mg daily.
   CHF doesn't seem to be major component based on exam, cxr.
   Renal failure - no acute indication for dialysis but oliguric.
   Poor nutrition- pt refused feeding tube in the past and has had very
   poor PO intake over the past few weeks. Has feeding tube but pt has
   refused tube feeds, refused PEG, refused placement of dobhoff. Will
   discuss with family and determine feeding plan today.
   Meropenem for UTI.
   Partial SBO, good bowel sounds.
   Need family meeting- will also try to include Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 616**] and renal

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic respiratory and renal failure, chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, diabetes mellitus, prior pulmonary embolism, and multiple abdominal surgeries for small bowel obstruction/hematoma. The patient is currently unresponsive, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. He presents with worsening mental status, respiratory distress, worsening acidosis, and poor urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is critically ill and faces multiple potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's poor urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function, which may progress to acute kidney injury.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's worsening acidosis indicates a disturbance in the acid-base balance, which can be life-threatening if not corrected promptly.

4. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT/INR and PTT levels suggest a coagulopathic state, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's history of abdominal surgeries and current presentation with hypoactive bowel sounds and distended abdomen suggest partial SBO.

6. Malnutrition: The patient's refusal of enteral feeding tubes"

   [**7-22**] - Blooc Cx - NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on
   chronic multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. Likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, poor
   nutrition.
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Per family discuss
 hold on tube feeding as pt w/ discomfort from NG
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Convert steroids to IV as plan to withdraw NGT
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2,
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - DC po bicarb
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of renal failure
   Cr now 7.5. Likely related to ATN during previous episodes of
   hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN. Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
 discuss future HD with family
 felt it
   will like not alter long-term outcome given multiorgan system failure
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - renal US negative for obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past  - continue to hold per family meeting
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry
 rate related LBBB. Troponins trending
   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
 hold given DC of NGT
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Will hold on TF for now per discussion with family.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: DNR
 family meeting held on [**7-27**]. Cardiac resuscitation not
   medically indicated given pt
s multiorgan system failure. Family
   agreeable to change in code status
   .
   # Goals of care
 family meeting held today. Family members will
   consider transitioning to goals of comfort given pt
s overall poor
   prognosis. Will continue medical regimen but hold on any procedures
   that may cause pt discomfort. Focus goals of care on comfort

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was originally admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, urinary tract infection, partial small bowel obstruction, and acute renal failure. She is now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors including infection, renal failure, and poor nutrition. Treatment for urinary tract infection is ongoing, and the family has decided to hold tube feeding as the patient experiences discomfort from the nasogastric (NG) tube.

2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, likely secondary to renal failure and an exacerbation of her COPD. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a goal pH of 7.2. Albuterol and ipratropium nebs are being used as needed, and the plan is to convert steroids to intravenous (IV) form before withdrawing the NG tube.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has progressively deteriorated, with creatinine levels now at 7.5. This is likely related to acute tubular necrosis during previous episodes of hypotension, recurrent urinary tract infections, and possible prior anal"

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on
   chronic multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. Likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, poor
   nutrition.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Address nutritional status with family re desire for feeding tube
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of renal failure
   Cr now 7.5. Likely related to ATN during previous episodes of
   hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN. Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
 discuss future HD with family
 felt it
   will like not alter long-term outcome given multiorgan system failure
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - renal US negative for obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry
 rate related LBBB. Troponins trending
   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Will hold on TF for now per discussion with family.

   # Code: DNR
 family meeting held on [**7-27**]. Cardiac resuscitation not
   medically indicated given pt
s multiorgan system failure. Family
   agreeable to change in code status

   # Goals of care
 family meeting held today. Family members will
   consider transitioning to goals of comfort given pt
s overall poor
   prognosis. Will continue aggressive medical regimen but hold on any
   procedures that may cause pt discomfort. No acute indication for HD,
   family will continue to discuss possibility of future HD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status post tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute renal failure. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to multiorgan system failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status remains altered, which could be due to a combination of factors such as infection, renal failure, poor nutrition, and the effects of sedating medications. It is important to optimize her nutritional status and minimize the use of sedating medications.

2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function has deteriorated further, likely secondary to renal failure and an exacerbation of COPD. She may require mechanical ventilation support, and adjustments in her current medications and treatment plan will be necessary.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has progressively worsened, with a creatinine level of 7.5. This could be attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) during previous episodes of hypotension, recurrent UTIs, and possible prior adverse drug reactions. Hemodialysis has been discussed but may not be urgently needed. However"

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on
   chronic multiorgan system failure.
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. Likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, poor
   nutrition.
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Per family discuss
 hold on tube feeding as pt w/ discomfort from NG
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Convert steroids to IV as plan to withdraw NGT
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2,
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - DC po bicarb
   # Acute renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of renal failure
   Cr now 7.5. Likely related to ATN during previous episodes of
   hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN. Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
 discuss future HD with family
 felt it
   will like not alter long-term outcome given multiorgan system failure
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - renal US negative for obstruction
   -started steroids for ?AIN
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past  - continue to hold per family meeting
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry
 rate related LBBB. Troponins trending
   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
 hold given DC of NGT
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Will hold on TF for now per discussion with family.
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code: DNR
 family meeting held on [**7-27**]. Cardiac resuscitation not
   medically indicated given pt
s multiorgan system failure. Family
   agreeable to change in code status
   # Goals of care
 family meeting held today. Family members will
   consider transitioning to goals of comfort given pt
s overall poor
   prognosis. Will continue medical regimen but hold on any procedures
   that may cause pt discomfort. Focus goals of care on comfort

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was initially admitted to the ICU with altered mental status due to a urinary tract infection and partial small bowel obstruction. She has now been transferred back to the ICU with acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including infection, renal failure, and poor nutrition. It is important to address the underlying causes and provide appropriate treatment and support.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient continues to tolerate tracheostomy mask. Respiratory support should be continued, and efforts should be made to wean off mechanical ventilation if possible.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although there is a small drop in hemoglobin concentration, no active bleeding is present at the moment. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding and close observation are necessary.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is progressively worsening, indicated by the increasing creatinine levels. Management should focus on optimizing renal function and preventing further deterioration.
5. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a history of resistant infections, but the current urine culture shows sensitivity to meropenem. Continuing antibiotic therapy with meropenem is appropriate.
6. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a"

   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now  in ICU with acute on chronic multiorgan system
   failure.
   # Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial including infection,
   renal failure, poor nutrition. Brighter today.
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Per family discuss
 hold on tube feeding as pt w/ discomfort from NG
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Continues
   to tolerate trach mask.
   - will not go back on vent as per discussion with daughter, [**Name (NI) 3213**], as
   documented in Dr [**Name (NI) 3129**]
s note in paper chart.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   -Continue steroids
   #  GIB:  HCT with small drop. No active bleeding at present.  No plans
   to transfuse or work-up per discussion with family.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of
   renal failure
 Cr now 8.5. Likely related to ATN during previous
   episodes of hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN.
   - no plans for HD
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry
 rate related LBBB. Troponins trending
   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
 hold given D/C of NGT
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Will hold on TF for now per discussion with family, as
   they feel that the feeding tube was clearly uncomfortable for her.
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code: DNR
 family meeting held on [**7-27**]. Cardiac resuscitation not
   medically indicated given pt
s multiorgan system failure. Family
   agreeable to change in code status
   # Goals of care
 Family members will consider transitioning to goals
   of comfort given pt
s overall poor prognosis. Will continue medical
   regimen but hold on any procedures that may cause pt discomfort. Focus
   goals of care on comfort

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, which was found to be due to a urinary tract infection, partial small bowel obstruction, and acute renal failure. She is now in the ICU with acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including infection, renal failure, and poor nutrition. It is important to continue treating the urinary tract infection and discuss with the family about holding tube feeding as the patient experiences discomfort from the nasogastric tube.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient continues to tolerate a tracheostomy mask but will not be placed on a ventilator as per the family's decision. It is important to continue using albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed and continue steroid treatment.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, with a recent drop in hemoglobin concentration. No active bleeding is currently present, and no plans for transfusion or further work-up have been made per family discussion.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is progressively worsening, with a creatinine level of 8.5"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status post tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and altered mental status. She was admitted to the ICU with urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. She is now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may continue to be impaired due to renal failure, poor nutrition, and active infection.
2. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function may worsen, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy collar removal.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient may experience further deterioration in renal function, possibly requiring dialysis.
4. UTI: The patient has a history of resistant infections, and there is a risk of recurrence or progression of the UTI.
5. SBO: The patient's bowel obstruction may lead to ischemic bowel or perforation, potentially requiring surgical intervention or focus on comfort measures.
6. NSTEMI: The patient has evidence of myocardial injury, and cardiac intervention may be necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
7. Seizures: The patient is at risk of recurrent seizures, and ongoing seizure prophylaxis should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status post tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and altered mental status. She was admitted to the ICU with a urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. The patient is now experiencing acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving but remains altered, possibly due to renal failure, poor nutrition, and active infection.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient has COPD and was previously on a ventilator. The family has decided against putting her back on the ventilator if her respiratory status worsens.
3. Acute renal failure: The cause of the renal failure is uncertain, but it could be related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from initial sepsis or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
4. UTI: The patient has a history of resistant infections, but the current urine culture shows sensitivity to meropenum.
5. Lower GI bleed: The patient may have experienced a lower gastrointestinal bleed likely due to coagulopathy from poor nutrition. The family prefers not to pursue surgical intervention or blood transfusions.
6. SBO: The patient had an NG tube decompression"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status post tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and originally admitted to the ICU with altered mental status found to have urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure now with acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

24-hour events include the last dose of antibiotics (meropenem) given at 03:00 PM on [date]. The patient received morphine sulfate at 12:30 AM on [date] and lorazepam (Ativan) at 05:30 AM on [date]. 

Vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 36.6°C (97.8°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) at 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate (HR) at 94 bpm with a normal range of 89-100 bpm, blood pressure (BP) at 134/57 mmHg with a range of 77-149/78-94 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 12 breaths per minute with a normal range of 11-25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 98% on tracheostomy mask, and sinus rhythm (SR) as the heart rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 440 mL with 74 mL going into the peripheral vein (IVF) and a total output of 232 mL with 50 mL going into the blood products. Urine output is also 232 mL with a total output of 50 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask with SpO2 at 98%. No ABG results are mentioned in the progress note.

Physical examination findings include a well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds without murmurs, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and no skin or neurologic assessment performed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 456 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 22.7%, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 56 K/uL, increased creatinine (Cr) of 8.4 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T of 0.96, decreased total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 13 mmHg, low glucose levels ranging from 53-112 mg/dL, and other lab values including prolonged prothrombin time (PT) / partial thromboplastin time (PTT) / international normalized ratio (INR), elevated lactate acid, normal calcium (Ca++), magnesium ("
