   decanulation now with sepsis after aspiration event.
   .
   #  Septic Shock: most likely source sacral decub vs line infection (old
   PICC line in place) vs aspiration PNA although chest CT without
   evidence of PNA.  Wound care probed sacral decub to bone.
   - cover broadly for hospital-acquired respiratory vs. aspiration vs.
   skin/soft tissue source w/ vanc/zosyn/cipro. Consider d/c cipro if FR
   CT shows no PNA as then unlikely to need double pseudamonal coverage.
   - follow up blood, urine cx data
   - obtain sputum if possible
   - speech/swallow study
   - hold on further fluid boluses in setting of DNR/DNI status and
   worsening edema on CXR/CT
   - F/U CT sacral decub for osteo ->would change duration of antbiotic
   therapy
   - cte to wean pressors. Currently on only small dose of levophed with
   stable pressures.
   - trend lactate, MvO2
   .
   # Hypoxia: Developed in setting of recent aspiration event. Diff
   includes aspiration pneumonitis vs. pulmonary edema
   - minimize IVF as possible
   - f/u FR CT chest
   - titrate NC to sats >90%
   - broad-spectrum ABX as above
   - aggressive pulmonary toilet

   # H/O MSSA right knee prothestic joint arthritis: followed by ID as
   outpt
   -Per ID recs if on vanc/zosyn can hold rifampin while here but will
   restart again eventually.
   .
   # Sacral Decubitus: Has been evaluated by plastics as outpt. Dtrs
   requested CT scan to look for osteo which doctors at rehab told them he
   needed. This was done yesterday.
   - wound care consulted and recommended specific wound recs
   - CT fr pending
   - outpt plastic team has been notified of admission
   - low dose morphine prn for pain

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of MSSA prosthetic joint arthritis and respiratory failure after tracheal decannulation. He presented with sepsis following an aspiration event. The patient's recent prolonged hospital course includes coverage for hospital-acquired respiratory infections, aspiration pneumonia, and skin/soft tissue infections. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn, ciprofloxacin) and has been started on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition could worsen if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
2. Organism Resistance: The prolonged hospital course and multiple antibiotic regimens may lead to antibiotic resistance.
3. Multi-organ Failure: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hypotension due to septic shock increase the risk of multi-organ failure.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if there is persistent hypoxia or pneumonia.
5. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient remains on pressors, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability which needs close monitoring.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 33.5 on admission to 22 currently, indicating acute blood loss or hemolysis.
7. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent prolonged hospital course for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) prosthetic joint arthritis and respiratory failure after tracheostomy decannulation. He is now presenting with sepsis following an aspiration event.

The patient's medical history includes MSSA right knee prosthetic joint arthritis, for which he is being followed by infectious disease as an outpatient. He also has sacral decubitus ulcers, which have been evaluated by plastics as outpatients. The patient's family requested a CT scan to look for osteomyelitis, which was done yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 110/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 76-86%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL, glucose of 86 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and platelet count of 270 K/uL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, sacral decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, impaired skin integrity, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and required mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. He has a central line, arterial line, and pre-rose catheter in place. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to have decreased simple pleural effusions and multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening on CT chest. These findings suggest pneumonia or hemorrhage, possibly due to recent bronchoscopy and mechanical ventilation. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 33.5 on admission to 22.4, indicating potential hemoconcentration. He is receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells and guaiac stool tests are positive, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemolysis labs have been sent to investigate further. The patient's blood culture results are pending, and he is being monitored closely for any signs of wound dehiscence, infection, or other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia or hemorrhage due to recent bronchoscopy and mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding indicated by positive guaiac stool tests and decreased hemoglobin concentration.
3. Hemolysis suggested by decreased"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent prolonged hospital course for MSSA prosthetic joint arthritis and respiratory failure following tracheal decannulation. He now presents with septic shock, likely due to aspiration pneumonia or a line infection. The patient has been covered broadly with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. Further blood and urine culture data is pending. The source of infection may be pneumonia, a line infection, or a sacral decubitus. The patient's hypoxia is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of MSSA right knee prosthetic joint arthritis and a sacral decubitus. He also has anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 33.5, which has decreased to 22 after receiving blood products.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection. Immediate treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation is necessary.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to aspiration pneumonia, which can occur when foreign material enters the lungs. This can lead to lung inflammation and infection.
3. Line infection: The patient's septic shock could also be caused by a line infection, where bacteria enter the bloodstream through an intravenous cath"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of recent prolonged hospitalization for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) prosthetic joint arthritis and respiratory failure after tracheostomy decannulation. The patient now presents with sepsis following an aspiration event. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 112/46 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented to place and month, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the right base, coarse crackles throughout lower lung fields, and a large stage III/VI sacral decubitus with scant tan discharge. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 25.9%, and decreased platelet count of 270 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging studies show multifocal mostly perihilar and dependent ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening, which could be indicative of pneumonia, hemorrhage, or symmetric edema. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including shock, anemia, hypoxia, and a history of MSSA right knee prosthetic joint arthritis. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of these complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of recent prolonged hospitalization for MSSA prosthetic joint arthritis and respiratory failure after tracheal decannulation. He is now presenting with sepsis following an aspiration event. The patient has been afebrile with resolution of leukocytosis on broad antibiotic coverage, and pressors have been weaned off overnight. Cultures have been negative to date except for yeast in the urine, and C. difficile is negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's recent aspiration event may have led to shock due to possible aspiration pneumonia or sepsis. The patient's condition has improved with resolution of fever and leukocytosis on broad antibiotic coverage. However, close monitoring is necessary to ensure continued stability.

2. Anemia: The patient has an unclear source of anemia, but there is a trace guaiac positive result indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Two units of packed red blood cells were transfused yesterday with only a minimal increase in hemoglobin concentration. Daily monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion for hemoglobin levels below 21 should be considered. Active tissue and serum testing should also be continued.

3. Hypoxia: The patient developed hypoxia in the setting of the recent aspiration event. Differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema. It is important to avoid intravenous fluids for now, continue to wean oxygen as tolerated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent prolonged hospital course for MSSA prosthetic joint arthritis and respiratory failure following tracheal decannulation. The patient now presents with sepsis after an aspiration event. The patient's condition has been stable, with resolution of leukocytosis on broad antibiotic coverage, and pressors have been weaned off overnight. Cultures are negative to date, except for yeast in the urine, and Clostridium difficile is negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is at risk for shock due to a possible aspiration pneumonia causing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is essential.
2. Hypoxia: The patient developed hypoxia following the aspiration event. Differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. Oxygen therapy, aggressive pulmonary toilet, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued.
3. Sacral Decubitus: The patient has a stage III/VI sacral decubitus ulcer with scant tan discharge. Proper wound care recommendations should be followed, and regular assessments of the wound should be performed to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable at this time, but close monitoring and aggressive management of potential complications are necessary to prevent further deterioration."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of MSSA prosthetic joint arthritis and respiratory failure who recently underwent tracheal decannulation.
- The patient developed sepsis following an aspiration event. Despite being on broad antibiotic coverage, the patient's condition remained stable with resolution of leukocytosis. Pressors were successfully weaned off overnight.
- The patient's current medical complications include shock, hypoxia, and a sacral decubitus.
- The patient has a history of MSSA right knee prosthetic joint arthritis and is being followed by ID as an outpatient. Rifampin is being held per ID recommendations.
- The patient is receiving tube feeds and has been receiving blood transfusions due to low hemoglobin levels.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/46 to 126/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the right base, coarse crackles throughout the lower lung fields, and a large stage III/VI sacral decubitus with scant tan discharge.
- The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL and a decreased hemoglobin level of 25.9%.
- Imaging studies show inflammatory changes in the soft tissues posterior to the sacrococcygeal junction, extending to the bony surface, and possible involvement of the spinal canal. An MRI would provide superior detail to evaluate the spinal canal contents and possible involvement of the inflammatory process.
- The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
   - Controlling sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn)
   - Following up with blood cultures
   - Obtaining sputum if possible
   - No IV fluids for now
   - Titrating face mask to sats >90%
   - Broad-spectrum abx as above
   - Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - Appreciating plastics recs re: wound care
   - Holding rifampin 300mg po daily per ID recs
   - Nutren 2.0 (Full) at 30 mL/hour
   - DVT prophylaxis with boots and SQ heparin
   - Stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker
   - VAP prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and further deterioration of the sacral decubitus."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course for MSSA prosthetic joint arthritis and respiratory failure following tracheal decannulation. He now presents with sepsis secondary to aspiration.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Shock: The patient has likely developed shock due to the aspiration pneumonia complicated by sepsis. Pressors were weaned off overnight, and the patient remains afebrile with resolution of leukocytosis on broad antibiotic coverage. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, follow-up blood cultures, and obtain sputum if possible.

2. Hypoxia: The patient developed hypoxia in the setting of the recent aspiration event. Differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The plan includes titrating the face mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and aggressive pulmonary toilet.

3. MSSA Prosthetic Joint Arthritis: The patient has a history of MSSA right knee prosthetic joint arthritis, which is being followed by Infectious Disease as an outpatient. Rifampin is being held per ID recommendations.

4. Sacral Decubitus: There is evidence of osteomyelitis on CT L-spine, and probes have gone through to the bone. The patient requires wound care recommendations from plastics.

5. Prolonged Hospital Course: The patient has had a"
