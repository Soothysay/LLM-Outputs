   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had abdominal pain on exam got plain film: nonobstructive bowel gas
   pattern. No evidence of free air. Scoliosis. Large
   hiatal hernia.
   - R shoulder/arm pain --> plain film: diffuse osteopenia. No definite
   fracture seen. Subtle fracture might be missed, get CT if further
   concern.
   - C spine flexion/extension plain films WET read: suboptimal for
   evaluation due to multilevel severe DJD. If continuos concern MRI can
   be done to r/o ligamentous injury.
   - 5pm Hct 26.4 --> 1130pm Hct 25.5, and CE's trended down
   - Trauma: attempt to clear c-collar clinically, serial abdominal exams.
   - Ortho: merits ORIF but is DNR/DNR, cognitively impaired presently.
   Will discuss with family before proceeding.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.
   Labs include a normal lipase, normal LFT
s, but a  worsening WBC count.
   - Add on amylase to this am
s labs
   - Repeat KUB this morning to evaluate for free air and would consider
   repeat CT if worsens
   - Abdominal U/S this morning to evaluate for free fluid
   - Will get VBG with lactate this morning to eval for ischemia
   - Consider Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult if abd pain continues
   - Guaic all stools
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Need to get consent for blood products as we currently have no ICU
   consent
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Most worrisome now at this point would be an abdominal
   process.  Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than [**Last Name (LF) 11653**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   this isn
t an active issue but important to keep in mind.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, keep NPO for now given possible OR

 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.
   Labs include a normal lipase, normal LFT
s, but a  worsening WBC count.
   - Add on amylase to this am
s labs
   - Repeat KUB this morning to evaluate for free air and would consider
   repeat CT if worsens
   - Abdominal U/S this morning to evaluate for free fluid
   - Will get VBG with lactate this morning to eval for ischemia
   - Consider Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult if abd pain continues
   - Guaic all stools
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Most worrisome now at this point would be an abdominal
   process.  Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than hypoTN.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, keep NPO for now given possible OR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and prior hip fracture. She presented with new-onset hip fracture, abdominal pain, and elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction (MI). The patient also has a history of osteoporosis, fall from a commode, and identified right femoral fracture. She has multiple plain films and CT scans to assess for fractures, as well as neck pain. The patient is currently on IV antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI), which has been present for more than a week. She has leukocytosis and worsening WBC count, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to delirium caused by the fall, fractures, infection, and medications. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, and glaucoma. The patient is DNR/DNI and her disposition is pending clinical improvement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the elevated troponin levels and history of CAD, the patient is at risk for further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of hip fracture and altered mental status may increase the risk of developing pulmonary complications such as pneumonia.
3. Infection"

The patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She presented with new-onset hip fracture, UTI, and elevated troponin levels after falling. She has a history of ORIF of the same leg, and there is a new comminuted fracture of the distal femur. Ortho has seen the patient and is considering OR for repair. The patient's preoperative risk assessment indicates high risk for surgery due to at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial ischemia.

 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis.  History of chronic urinary frequency at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on
   methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Send blood cultures if spikes.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than hypoTN.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented and described as ""cranky"".  Here
   patient is somewhat lethargic with speech that seems sometimes confused
   and at other times is difficult to understand.  Likely delerium in
   setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue home meds with holding parameters.
   - Give IV metoprolol if not taking PO meds.
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular disease, previous hip fracture, and cerebrovascular accident. The patient presented with new hip fracture, urinary tract infection (UTI), and elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial infarction (MI). She also has arm/shoulder pain and abdominal pain of unknown etiology.

The patient has a history of osteoporosis and fell from a commode, resulting in a right femoral fracture. She has multiple ecchymoses and possibly right shoulder pain. Imaging shows severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine, lumbar spine, and sacral spine with significant spinal canal stenosis. There is also a small focus of air within the bladder, which may be related to recent catheterization.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance and elevated white blood cell count. Her troponin levels are trending down, suggesting a declining MI. She has renal insufficiency with elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen levels.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute and blood pressure ranging from 137/77 to 171/113 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula. She has a mild fever with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F).

The patient is currently on multiple medications including metoprolol, ciprofloxacin, and levothyroxine. She has allergies to cephalosporins, Bactrim, and iodine.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her daughter is the healthcare proxy. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization and risk factors such as advanced age and history of hip fracture.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE) as a possible complication of DVT.
3. Further deterioration of the cervical spine or other fractures due to the patient's osteoporosis and degenerative changes.
4. Worsening of the abdominal pain and possible infection due to the UTI.
5. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or worsening MI due to the patient's history of cardiovascular disease and elevated troponin levels.
6. Delirium or altered mental status due to multiple factors including infection, medications, and the recent fall and fractures.
7. Pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
8. Aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's age and risk of dysphagia.

These are potential complications based on the patient's current condition and medical history. However, it is important to consider other factors and consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."

   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.  Has converted back to sinus rhythm.
   - convert diltiazem gtt to PO metoprolol.  Continue digoxin.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from

 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  We need to
   clarify today whether the patient will indeed be CMO.
   - Update orthopedics on plan of care.
   - Continue DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing PR tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly woman with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and prior hip fracture. She presented to the hospital with new-onset hip fracture, urinary tract infection (UTI), elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial infarction (MI), and abdominal pain of unknown etiology.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure of 77/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation rhythm.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (33.9 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (8.6 g/dL), elevated troponin (0.09 ng/mL), and elevated lactate (2.1 mmol/L). Imaging shows no change on chest X-ray and the presence of large amounts of stool on abdominal ultrasound. Microbiology results indicate the presence of GNRs in the urine.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of atrial fibrillation, hip fracture, abdominal pain, myocardial infarction, fall, anemia, UTI, respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, and glaucoma.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hip fracture, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, abdominal pain, and altered mental status. The patient has been declining over time, expressing a desire for comfort care and not aggressive measures. The patient's family is involved in the decision-making process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation that is difficult to control. It needs to be managed with appropriate medications to maintain a stable heart rhythm and prevent complications such as stroke.
2. Hip Fracture: The patient has a hip fracture resulting from a fall. The family does not consent to surgical intervention. Therefore, non-surgical management options, such as pain control and physical therapy, should be considered to improve mobility and prevent further complications.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has an active UTI with a significant bacterial load. Antibiotic treatment should be continued, and further evaluation of the urinary system is necessary to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate management.
4. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has evidence of an acute myocardial infarction, although it may be related to demand ischemia due to the acute fracture. It is important to manage the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure and dyslipidemia, and provide appropriate pain management to prevent further cardiac"

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.  Has converted back to sinus rhythm.
   - convert diltiazem gtt to PO metoprolol.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  We need to
   clarify today whether the patient will indeed be CMO.
   - Update orthopedics on plan of care.
   - Continue DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing PR tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - ASA, high dose statin.  Switch back to beta-blocker from diltiazem
   gtt.
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.  ? diffuse pain.
   - C spine cleared by trauma team.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Further work-up of fall will be held pending clarification of goals
   of care.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Continue to rise, predominantly PMN
s without bands.
   Likely stress response and UTI.  Need C.diff though patient not
   stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.  Limiting fentanyl as possible.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine IV for now..
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation, which did not convert with lopressor or diltiazem boluses. She has been started on diltiazem gtt and getting digoxin load. Her rhythm has converted back to sinus rhythm. The patient's daughter does not want surgical intervention for her hip fracture and is opting for comfort care.

The patient also has an elevated troponin level, thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute fracture, not an ACS event. She has been on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12 for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to delirium in the setting of her fall, fracture, infection, and medications.

   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.

   - Will get VBG with lactate this morning to eval for ischemia
   - Consider Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult if abd pain continues
   - Guaic all stools
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing

   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Need to get consent for blood products as we currently have no ICU
   consent
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Most worrisome now at this point would be an abdominal
   process.  Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than [**Last Name (LF) 11653**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   this isn
t an active issue but important to keep in mind.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was

","Summary:
The patient is a [**Age over 90**]-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF), a femoral neck fracture from a fall, UTI, elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial ischemia, abdominal pain, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is at high risk for surgery. She has a DNR/DNI code status and her disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hip Fracture: The patient has a comminuted fracture of the distal femur, which may require operative repair. However, due to her high-risk status for surgery, this needs to be carefully evaluated.
2. UTI: The patient has a significant leukocytosis with many bacteria on microscopy, suggesting a urinary tract infection. She is currently on ciprofloxacin and will be transitioned to oral antibiotics when able.
3. NSTEMI: The patient initially had elevated troponin levels, but they have trended downwards. This may represent demand ischemia rather than an acute coronary syndrome event. Further cardiac evaluation is needed, including an EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in clinical status.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient has tenderness in all four quadrants of the abdomen with significant guarding and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging has revealed"

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  In the
   meantime, patient may be approaching
   History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted fracture of distal
   femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.  Preoperative risk
   assessment - patient is currently high risk for surgery with at least
   one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac morbidity with evidence
   of elevated troponins/active myocardial ischemia (though this likely is
   reflective of increased demand).  However, she has a significant
   femoral fracture necessitating operative repair if in line with goals
   of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  PMN
s without bands.  Likely stress response and UTI.
   Need C.diff though patient not stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, keep NPO for now given possible OR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current symptoms, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which is not being well controlled with medication. This increases the risk of blood clots and stroke.

2. Myocardial Infarction (MI), Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has elevated troponin levels indicating a possible heart attack. However, it is mentioned that this may be due to demand ischemia rather than an actual MI.

3. Hip Fracture: The patient has a new hip fracture, and there is a decision pending regarding surgical intervention. The patient's age and medical conditions make surgery risky.

4. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, but the cause is unclear. There is no evidence of infection or bowel ischemia.

5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a significant leukocytosis and bacteria in the urine, indicating a UTI. This needs to be treated promptly to prevent complications.

6. Fall Risk: The patient has a history of falls and osteoporosis, which increases the risk of further falls and fractures.

7. Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient is hyperventilating, leading to respiratory alkalosis. This could be due to pain or agitation.

8. Leukocyt"
