   Assessment and Plan
   I>ASSESSMENT:</I>97F with history of bleeding gastric ulcers, MDS,
   pulmonary fibrosis and HTN presenting with anemia and GI bleed.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## GI bleed:</I>Presumed lower given gross rectal bleeding and
   negative NG lavage, although does have a history of UGIB.  Ddx for
   bleed includes: AVM, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, UGIB/gastric ulcers,
   mass, mesenteric ischemia, colitis.
   -GI consult appreciated, consider prep tonight for scope in am. Current
   plan to perform EGD in ICU this afternoon.
   -maintain 2x large bore PIVs
   -Active T+S
   -Q6 Hct/plt checks initially, transfuse for <21 or drop >3 units.
   Transfuse platelets for <50K or for each 3 units PRBCs.
   -If further hct drop at next check or failure to respond to 4 units,
   arrange for tagged RBC scan
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] until upper source ruled out
   -NPO for now with maintenance fluids and bolus prn for
   hypotension/tachycardia, favor blood for resuscitation initially.
   -f/u surgery recs
   -repeat coags, FFP for INR >1.5
   .
   <I>## Elevated INR:</I>Unclear etiology, consumptive in setting of
   bleed vs nutritional.
   -repeat coags
   -check albumin
   -FFP as above for INR >1.5
   .
   <I>## Atrial Fibrillation:<I> Apparently new.  Currently rate
   controlled, after fluid rescusitation. BP stable. Has evidence of right
   sided failure on exam with elevated JVP and lower extremity edema.
   Oxygenating well, no evidence of decompensated pulmonary edema. AF may
   be due to stress of recent acute bleed, it is possible the blood loss
   is subscute and that this triggered AF 10 days ago leading to the CHF
   and LE edema.  Will focus on monitoring bleeding and hemodynamic
   stability in short term, if resuscitation and cessation of bleeding
   does not resolve AF will need to look into other etiologies:
   -Consider TTE when more stable
   -Check TSH
   -Ensure adequate fluid/blood resuscitation, monitor for pulmonary
   edema.
   -repeat ECG in am.
   .
   <I>## MDS:</I>
   -Unclear recent hematocrit baseline.  Was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5900**] in [**3-6**], WBC
   reported as 20, other labs not in system.  Contact PCP for recent labs.
   -continue weekly procrit, due Wednesday.
   .
   <I>## Pulmonary Fibrosis:</I>
   -supplemental 02 prn
   .
   <I>## Hypertension:</I>Hypotensive in ED in setting of hypovolemia.
   Hold all antihypertensives until bleeding resolved.
   .
   <I>## FEN/Lytes:</I> NPO for now with maintenance IVF + prn bolus,
   lytes prn.
   .
   <I>## Prophylaxis:</I> Pneumoboots, hold off on heparin due to bleed.
   .
   <I>## Code status:</I> FULL CODE, however was DNR at last admission,
   will readdress with son and patient.
   .
   <I>## Dispo:</I> Pending resolution of bleeding, stable hct.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 97-year-old female with a history of bleeding gastric ulcers, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), pulmonary fibrosis, and hypertension. She presented with anemia and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient underwent an endoscopy to identify the source of the bleed. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF), elevated INR, and right-sided heart failure.

The plan includes performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the ICU to further investigate the GI bleed. The patient will maintain 2x large bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, and blood products will be transfused as necessary to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) above 21% and platelets above 50K. If there is further Hct drop or inadequate response to 4 units of blood, a tagged red blood cell scan will be arranged.

The patient will receive intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) until an upper GI source is ruled out. She will be kept nil per os (NPO), with maintenance fluids and bolus prn for hypotension/tachycardia, favoring blood for resuscitation initially. Repeat coagulation studies and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be given for an INR >1.5. Surgery recommendations will be followed up on.

Regarding the elevated INR, it is unclear whether it is due to consumptive coagul"

","Summary:
The patient is a 97-year-old woman with a history of bleeding gastric ulcers, MDS, pulmonary fibrosis, and hypertension. She presented with anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an endoscopy that revealed a duodenal ulcer, which was treated with clipping. She received a blood transfusion of 4 units packed red blood cells. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has evidence of right-sided heart failure and lower extremity edema. She also has atrial fibrillation, which may be related to the recent acute bleed. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding, especially with the presence of a duodenal ulcer.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Right-sided heart failure: The patient shows signs of right-sided heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure and lower extremity edema.
4. Pulmonary Fibrosis: The patient has a history of pulmonary fibrosis, which can lead to respiratory complications.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's advanced age and chronic conditions may put her at risk for malnutrition.

","The patient is a 97-year-old female with a history of bleeding gastric ulcers, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), pulmonary fibrosis, and hypertension. The patient presented with anemia and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. In the ICU, the patient's Hct remained stable, but there was a small amount of perirectal blood loss. The patient lost access and had it replaced with an 18-gauge line. The patient's proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was switched, and she underwent an echocardiogram that showed 4+ tricuspid regurgitation (TR), right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%. The patient's home blood pressure medications were restarted, and the patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/48-143/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has atrial fibrillation (AF). Fluid balance shows an input of 1,522 mL and output of 1,250 mL, resulting in a balance of 272 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 97-year-old woman with a history of bleeding gastric ulcers, MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome), pulmonary fibrosis, and hypertension. She presented with anemia and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient had a duodenal ulcer that was treated with endoscopic clipping. She received 4 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) but lost IV access and required replacement. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level remained stable. She was switched to pantoprazole (Protonix) for proton pump inhibition. The patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed 4+ tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Her blood pressure medications were restarted, and she has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The patient has weeping edema bilaterally with 3+ lower extremity (LE) edema, some pretibial skin breakdown, and crackles at the bases bilaterally on pulmonary examination. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 103/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. She is on supplemental oxygen. She has atrial fibrillation (AF) with an irregularly irregular rhythm. Lab results show"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of bleeding gastric ulcers, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), pulmonary fibrosis, and hypertension. She presented with anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient underwent an endoscopy which revealed an upper gastrointestinal bleed caused by a duodenal ulcer. The ulcer was treated with clipping. 

Her lab results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The coagulation profile is abnormal with an elevated INR. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient developed atrial fibrillation, which is believed to be related to the stress of the recent acute bleed. This could have led to right-sided heart failure, as evidenced by elevated jugular venous pressure and lower extremity edema. Oxygenation is good, with no signs of decompensated pulmonary edema.

The patient's pulmonary fibrosis may be contributing to crackles on examination, although it is unclear if this is due to volume overload and congestive heart failure or low albumin levels. The patient has severe lower extremity edema, suggesting heart failure or low albumin.

The patient's hypertension is currently being managed with diuretics. The patient's diet is being advanced as tolerated.

The patient is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. There is no mention of venous"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F with history of bleeding gastric ulcers, MDS, pulmonary fibrosis
   and HTN presenting with anemia and GI bleed.
   .
   GI bleed: Upper GI bleed found on endoscopy.  Patient had another
   episode of duodenal bleeding yesterday.  Was another lesion, was
   cauterized and had epinephrine injected around site.  Patient has not
   had any further melanotic bowel movements this morning.  Patient has
   remained hemodynamically stable.  HCT has been stable since
   transfusion.
   -Check q4hrs HCT for now, transition to q8hrs
   -Active T & S
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Atrial Fibrillation: Apparently new.  Currently rate controlled, after
   fluid rescusitation. BP stable. Has evidence of right sided failure on
   exam with elevated JVP and lower extremity edema.  Oxygenating well, no
   evidence of decompensated pulmonary edema. AF may be due to stress of
   recent acute bleed, it is possible the blood loss is subscute and that
   this triggered AF 10 days ago leading to the CHF and LE edema.  Will
   focus on monitoring bleeding and hemodynamic stability in short term,
   if resuscitation and cessation of bleeding does not resolve AF will
   need to look into other etiologies. TTE showed 4+ TR, RV dysfx, right
   dilated with mod free wall  hypokenesis, LA mod dilated, mod [**Last Name (un) 5490**].
   - Continue to monitor
   - Poor candidate for anticoagulation
   .
   MDS:
   -Unclear recent hematocrit baseline.  Was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5900**] in [**3-6**], WBC
   reported as 20, other labs not in system.  Contact PCP for recent labs.
   -continue weekly procrit as outpatient
   .
   Pulmonary Fibrosis:
   -supplemental 02 prn on 2L at home
   .
   Crackles on exam: unclear if it is pulm fibrosis vs volume overload and
   CHF.  However, worsened in the setting of increased volume and thus
   likely acute  CHF.  Pt with no echo in the system.  Pt also with severe
   LE edema suggesting heart failure vs low albumin.
   -If patient is hemodynamically stable, consider diuresis 1-2L
   negative.
   .
   Hypertension : Hypotensive in ED in setting of hypovolemia.
   -Hold Maxzide for now, restart if continues to be hemodynamically
   stable.
   .
   FEN/Lytes:
   -advance diet as tolerated
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots if pt can tolerate them however
   thrombocytopenia so clot risk is low.   No heparin SC given recent
   UGIB.
