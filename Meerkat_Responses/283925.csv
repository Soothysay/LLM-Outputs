   24 Hour Events:
   78 y/o F bronchiectasis, severe COPD with baseline 2L 02 requirement,
   tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent who presents with acute respiratory
   distress. Patient initially presented to [**Hospital 4705**] Hospital speaking in 1
   word sentences, tripoding, found to have an ABG 7.22/110/176/43 and was
   consequently intubated. Patient was given solmedrol 125 mg IV,
   levofloxacin and zosyn. Per records patient had a CXR which
   demonstrated right pleural effusion and RLL infiltrate.
   In [**Hospital1 19**] ED, initial vs were: T 98 P 120 BP 137/70. Patient was felt to
   be desynchronous on vent, started on propofol became hypotensive and
   was switched over to versed. Central line was placed and 3 L NS given.
   Patient was also given vancomycin. Labs pertinent for a lactate of 4,
   left shift N 91.5%, platelets 122.
   According to family patient demonstrated increasing respiratory
   distress the past week and yesterday ""lungs sounded junky"". She was
   also increasingly somnelent and confused the past week. They denie
   fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headaches, vision
   changes, neck stiffness or chest pain. The do report decreased fluid
   intake.
   Of note, patient was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 13481**] for H1N1
   Influenza, COPD exacerbation with pseudomonas growing from sputum,
   urinary tract infection (+ ESBL). Patient discharged on Ertapenem for
   10 days total.

   urinary tract infection and pseudomonas pneumonia. However, Ua
   negative, CXR no infiltrate , negative blood cultures to date and
   patient is afebrile. CVP 8 following 3 L NS suggesting hypovolemia and

   patient significantly decreased po intake and is consequently
   hypovolemic without sepsis. No evidence of acute bleed, guaiac negative

   underlying component of tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiactesis.
   However, patient without obvious trigger such as infection or classic
   symptoms such as increased sputum therefore must consider other
   etiologies such as obstructed stent. Less likely are cardiac etiology

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, severe COPD, and tracheobronchomalacia who presents with acute respiratory distress and hypotension. She was initially intubated and received steroids, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. The patient has a history of H1N1 influenza, COPD exacerbation with pseudomonas infection, and urinary tract infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. She is currently receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressor support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. The elevated lactate level suggests possible shock, but there is no evidence of end-organ damage at this time.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is most likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis. Other etiologies such as obstructed stent, cardiac issues, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia should be considered and ruled out.
3. Acid-Base Status: The patient has respiratory acidosis without adequate compensation, which may be secondary to underlying metabolic acidosis from elevated lactate levels.
4. Anemia: The patient has a decreased hemoglobin level, which could be due to dilutional effects from fluid administration.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreased, which may be caused by infection, sepsis, or dilutional effects. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) should be considered and ruled out.
6. Infection: The patient's history of ESBL-producing urinary tract infection and pseudomonas pneumonia raises concerns for ongoing infection. Monitoring blood and urine cultures is important in this case.
7. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia with Y-stent placement. Care should be taken to monitor for any complications related to the stent.

These are the potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD. She presented with acute respiratory distress, confusion, decreased fluid intake, and a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient was intubated and received broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a previous pseudomonas urinary tract infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of ESBL urinary tract infection and pseudomonas pneumonia, which raises concern for sepsis. However, her vital signs are stable, and she does not show any signs of end organ damage at this time.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to COPD exacerbation, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis. This can lead to further deterioration in her respiratory status and the need for increased ventilatory support.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension after receiving propofol, which may indicate a potential adverse reaction to the medication. Additionally, her low blood pressure could be due to hypovolemia resulting from decreased oral intake.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count of 122, which may be caused by infection, sepsis, or dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation"

   # Hypotension: Patient with initial lactate concerning for shock, since
   improved, and no evidence of end organ damage (adequate urine output,
   normal creatinine). Known recent ESBL urinary tract infection and
   pseudomonas pneumonia. Admission U/A negative, CXR w/o infiltrate,
   negative blood cultures to date, afebrile. CVP 8 following 3 L NS
   suggesting hypovolemia. It is possible due to increased somnolence
   patient significantly decreased PO intake and is consequently
   hypovolemic without sepsis. No evidence of acute bleed, guaiac negative
   on exam.
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Vancomycin and Meropenum due to prior ESBL and pseudomonas
   sensitivities, add levaquin as below
   - Levophed for MAP > 60
   - Follow blood and urine cultures
   - Daily CXR
   - If patient decompensates consider further infectious work-up (no
   history of abdominal or menigitis symptoms)
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**1-23**] COPD exacerbation with underlying
   component of tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiactesis. Per family
   increasing sleepiness (c/w hypercarbia), WOB, congestion over past
   week, especially past 2 days. Also confusion, decreased fluid intake.
   Less etiologies likely are cardiac etiology (no chest pain), PE (no
   risk factors, multiple other reasons for distress) or PNA (no
   infiltrate on CXR).
   - Bronchoscopy to assess positioning of stent
   - Standing NEBs
   - Solumedrol 125 mg IV q6hr for 72 hours then taper

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD exacerbation. She presented with acute respiratory distress, confusion, decreased fluid intake, and increasing sleepiness over the past week. The patient was intubated and received Solumedrol, Levofloxacin, and Zosyn. She was transferred to another hospital where she became hypotensive and switched to Versed. A central line was placed, and she received 3 L NS and Vancomycin. The patient's labs showed an elevated lactate level of 4, left shift neutrophils at 91.5%, and platelets at 122.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension and a high lactate level, indicating a potential shock state. However, she has since improved, and there is no evidence of end-organ damage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of her hypotension.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient likely has a COPD exacerbation with underlying components of tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiectasis. Her symptoms include increasing sleepiness, work of breathing, congestion, and confusion. It is important to assess the positioning of her stent through bronchoscopy and provide appropriate respiratory support.

3. Acid-Base Status: The patient has respiratory acidosis without adequate compensation"

   Addendum
   Called to see patient for tachycardia to 120s, then as high as 150.
   [image004.gif]
   Tachycardia is narrow complex, regular, with clear atrial activity.
   Breath sounds symmetric.  Vent peak pressures similar to prior; total
   PEEP only 10.  Denied pain but seemed anxious.
   Differential diagnosis is broad.  Will pursue diagnosis and therapy
   simultaneously:
          Bolus fluid
          Recheck Hct, type/cross, and check NG aspirate
 if (+) or
   falling, transfuse and assess further
          Sedate and provide analgesia
          Check EKG to exclude atrial tachycardia, though gentle
   increase in HR argues strongly against
          Disconnect from ventilator to ensure this is not occult
   occult PEEP
   If these do not diagnose or correct the tachycardia, then check CTA to
   exclude PE.
   If PE negative, above maneuvers not diagnostic, and blood pressure
   remains stable, can then consider beta blocker withdrawal.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman with respiratory failure. She has a history of COPD, bronchiectasis, and a stent for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TBM). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating the current ventilator settings, with some autoPEEP but no present evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ventilator settings include a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 22, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and compliance of 40 cmH2O/mL.
2. COPD exacerbation vs. bronchiectasis exacerbation: The patient is receiving steroids, bronchodilators, and mucinex. Antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) are continued, and cultures will be reviewed to consider adding a second anti-pseudomonal agent. Atypical coverage may also be added.
3. Severe sepsis: Occult hypoperfusion appears to have resolved. Fluids are given as needed.
4. TBM s/p stent: Bronchoscopy is planned to exclude stent dislodgement and ensure"

   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**1-23**] COPD exacerbation with underlying
   component of tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiactesis. Per family
   increasing sleepiness (c/w hypercarbia), WOB, congestion over past
   week, especially past 2 days. Also confusion, decreased fluid intake.
   Less etiologies likely are cardiac etiology (no chest pain), PE (no
   risk factors, multiple other reasons for distress) or PNA (no
   infiltrate on CXR). Bronchoscopy yesterday showed granulation tissue,
   appropriate Ystent placement and patent airways. Failed RSBI and PSV
   this morning.
   - try PSV again tomorrow
   - Standing NEBs
   - Solumedrol 125 mg IV q6hr for 72 hours then taper (Day [**1-24**])
   - Broad specturm antibiotics to cover HAP PNA (Vanc, Meropenem,
   Levaquin for atypicals); Day [**1-31**]
   - Hold outpatient Ativan
   - Monitor ABGs
   - CTA to rule out PE
   - Obtain sputum culture

   # Hypertension/tachycardia: ?anxiety/anger component
   - Consider changing sedation to propofol or precedex; may also be of
   benefit for hypertension
   - Fentanyl boluses PRN
   - Restarted Lopressor [**Hospital1 7**]; will hold amlodipine while changing
   sedatives to agents that may lower blood pressure
   - Consider CTA today given continued tachycardia with fluids/pRBC
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved.
   - Follow blood and urine cultures
   - Daily CXR
   # Acid Base Status: Respiratory acidosis resolved.
   - Trend ABG, CO2 improving now on vent.

   # Anemia: 31 from baseline 34-37. Guaiac negative on exam. Bumped
   appropriately to one unit pRBC yesterday
   - Active T&S
   - Trend HCT daily

   # Thrombocytopenia: 129 from baseline 300. Most likely etiology
   infection, sepsis or dilutional effect. Normal coags, therefore
   unlikely DIC. No renal failure to suggest TTP
   - trend daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD exacerbation requiring 2 liters of oxygen. The patient presented with acute respiratory distress and confusion, and was intubated due to respiratory failure. Initial ABG results showed respiratory acidosis, and the patient required mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system compliance of 33.3 mL/cmH2O. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's acute respiratory distress could be due to a COPD exacerbation, underlying tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis. Other possible causes such as cardiac etiology, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia have been ruled out based on clinical findings and imaging results.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may be related to anxiety, anger, or underlying medical conditions. The blood pressure and heart rate should be closely monitored and appropriate interventions should be considered.
3. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, but it has resolved. Ongoing monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Acid-Base Status: The patient initially presented with respiratory acidosis, but it has resolved. Monitoring of ABG and CO2 levels is essential to ensure the patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, and pseudomonal urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and has been experiencing increasing sleepiness, work of breathing, congestion, confusion, and decreased fluid intake over the past week. The patient's condition worsened, leading to intubation and transfer to another hospital.

The patient's medical history includes recent admission for H1N1 infection and COPD exacerbation with pseudomonas in sputum, as well as a urinary tract infection (UTI) positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The patient also has a documented allergy to sulfa medications, anaphylaxis to Bactrim, and hepatic toxicity with Lipitor.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 79-122 bpm, blood pressure of 147/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 30%.

   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**1-23**] COPD exacerbation with underlying
   component of tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiactesis. Per family
   increasing sleepiness (c/w hypercarbia), WOB, congestion over past
   week, especially past 2 days. Also confusion, decreased fluid intake.
   Less etiologies likely are cardiac etiology (no chest pain), PE (no
   risk factors, multiple other reasons for distress) or PNA (no
   infiltrate on CXR). Bronchoscopy yesterday showed granulation tissue,
   appropriate Ystent placement and patent airways. Failed RSBI this
   morning.
   - Standing NEBs
   - Solumedrol 125 mg IV q6hr for 72 hours then taper (Day [**1-24**])
   - Broad specturm antibiotics to cover HAP PNA (Vanc, Meropenem,
   Levaquin for atypicals); Day 2/?10
   - Hold outpatient Ativan

   # Hypotension: Patient with initial lactate concerning for shock, since
   improved, and no evidence of end organ damage (adequate urine output,
   normal creatinine). Known recent ESBL urinary tract infection and
   pseudomonas pneumonia. Admission U/A negative, CXR w/o infiltrate,
   negative blood cultures to date, afebrile. CVP 8 following 3 L NS
   suggesting hypovolemia. It is possible due to increased somnolence
   patient significantly decreased PO intake and is consequently
   hypovolemic without sepsis. No evidence of acute bleed, guaiac negative
   on exam.  Now resolved with aggressive resuscitation, antibiotics
 was
   briefly on Levophed
   - Follow blood and urine cultures
   - Daily CXR
   - If patient decompensates consider further infectious work-up (no
   history of abdominal or menigitis symptoms)
   # Acid Base Status: Respiratory acidosis without adequate compensation
   most likely secondary overlying metabolic acidosis from elevated
   lactate. Respiratory acidosis resolved.
   - Trend ABG, CO2 improving now on vent.

   # Anemia: 31 from baseline 34-37. Guaiac negative on exam. Most likely
   dilutional from NS. Bumped appropriately to one unit pRBC yesterday
   - Active T&S
   - Trend HCT daily
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: 122 from baseline 300. Most likely etiology
   infection, sepsis or dilutional effect. Normal coags, therefore
   unlikely DIC. No renal failure to suggest TTP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD who presented with acute respiratory distress. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has a recent history of H1N1 infection, COPD exacerbation with pseudomonas in sputum, and urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress, which led to the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. The cause of respiratory failure is likely a combination of underlying COPD exacerbation, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis. 
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing hypertension and tachycardia, which may be due to anxiety/anger. Treatment includes fentanyl/versed boluses as needed, restarting amlodipine, and considering a computed tomography angiography (CTA) to rule out other causes.
3. Hypotension: The patient had an episode of hypotension with elevated lactate levels, suggesting possible shock. However, the patient has since improved with aggressive resuscitation and antibiotics. The hypotension may be due to decreased oral intake leading to hypovolemia, rather than se"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted due to acute respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/67 to 161/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications including hypertension, tachycardia, tracheobronchomalacia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, COPD exacerbation, and anxiety. Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, her troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac involvement.

The patient's recent events include the failure of respiratory system assessment and pressure support ventilation trials, as well as anxiety and agitation. She has been treated with propofol for sedation, ativan for anxiety, and various antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing with weaning off mechanical ventilation, monitoring ABGs, restarting lopressor, and providing appropriate pain management. The team also plans to consult with a psychiatrist regarding the patient's anxiety and coping mechanisms. The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress. The patient requires 2L of oxygen and has been intubated. Initial bronchoscopy showed granulation tissue with appropriate Y-stent placement, but there is a fluid collection beneath the stent. The patient failed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials today. She is currently on pressure control mode ventilation (PCV) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate have improved since changing to propofol with fentanyl boluses. She is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Other ongoing assessments and plans include monitoring input/output (I/O), evaluating fluid collection, placing a new arterial line prior to next weaning attempt, and providing standing nebulizers. The patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, acid-base status, and hypertension/tachycardia have been addressed and managed accordingly.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a well-nourished but anxious individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's arterial line stopped at 03:14 PM. They were unable to tolerate a respiratory support level of 15/5 and were placed back on assisted control ventilation. The patient continues to be agitated when awake, with a respiratory support burden index (RSBI) of 116 this morning.

The patient underwent a CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism, which came back negative. Sputum cultures have been sent. The patient's medications have been adjusted, discontinuing Norvasc and continuing on Atenolol. Propofol has been started instead of Fentanyl/Versed, with blood pressure readings ranging from 120/130 mmHg.

The patient has a history of hypertension, altered mental status (not delirium), anxiety, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), anemia, tachycardia (other), hypotension (not shock), acidosis (respiratory), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, based on the provided information, some potential complications include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a significant risk for further respiratory"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, and previous Y-stent placement. She is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress due to a suspected COPD exacerbation with underlying components of tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiectasis. 

The patient underwent bronchoscopy which showed granulation tissue and appropriate Y-stent placement. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed and showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) but revealed some fluid beneath the stent. The patient failed respiratory system compliance (RSBI) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) again today. She also has auto-PEEP of 5 due to breath stacking and is currently on pressure support of 15/9. The patient lost airway pressure (A-line) yesterday and will have a new A-line placed prior to the next weaning attempt.

The patient's current medications include Solumedrol 125 mg IV q6hr, taper begins on [**2-13**], broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and pseudomonal urinary tract infection (UTI), and Norvasc is being held due to good blood pressure control.

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.5-9.2 thousand/mm^3, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) levels of 10.7-11.1 g/dL, and normal platelet (Plt) counts of 135-154 thousand/mm^3. Renal function tests indicate normal serum creatinine (Cr) levels of 0.4-0.6 mg/dL, while liver function tests show mildly elevated troponin-T levels of 0.01-0.05 ng/mL and slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels of 175 IU/L. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus on chest X-ray (CXR) and no evidence of interval recurrence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. There are no signs of pneumothorax or changes in the position of the nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube, and central venous access lines.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F) and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 97% on 30% FiO2.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing V"

   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**1-23**] COPD exacerbation with underlying
   component of tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiactesis. Initial
   bronchoscopy showed granulation tissue, appropriate Y-stent placement.
   CTA negative for PE, showed some ?fluid beneath stent. Thus, second
   bronchoscopy was done which showed some secretions around stent/ETT
   which was suctioned, mild repositioning of stent (higher up). Failed
   RSBI and PSV again yesterday night and this morning. Has auto-PEEP of 5
   due to breath stacking. Now on Assist Control again .
   - Plan to attempt again to wean to pressure support again this
   afternoon
   - Watch for auto-PEEP and breath stacking
   - Standing NEBs
   - Prednisone 60mg (first taper today from Solumedrol 125mg IV q8)
   - Broad specturm antibiotics to cover HAP PNA (Vanc, Meropenem,
   Levaquin for atypicals); Day [**3-31**] given MRSA+ screen.
   - Monitor I/O
   # Hypertension/tachycardia: Improved since changed to Propofol, with
   Fentanyl boluses prn (25 mcg). Does become hypertensive when ventilator
   weaning attempted.
   - Continue with Propofol
   - Fentanyl boluses PRN
   - Restarted Lopressor [**Hospital1 7**] (but half home dose at 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]); will hold
   Norvasc given good blood pressure control
   .
   # Tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stent placement: continue outpatient
   stent care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD who presented with acute respiratory distress. She underwent two bronchoscopies, with the second showing some secretions around the stent/ETT which were suctioned. She failed rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) attempts yesterday and this morning. She is currently on assist-control ventilation (ACV) and will be monitored for auto-PEEP and breath stacking. The plan is to attempt weaning to pressure support again this afternoon. She is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and pseudomonal urinary tract infection (UTI). Her hypertension and tachycardia have improved since changing to propofol with fentanyl boluses as needed. She will continue with propofol and restarted lopressor at half the home dose. Her tracheobronchomalacia status post Y-stent placement will continue with outpatient stent care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen if she fails to improve on assist-control ventilation or if she develops further complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of underlying COPD.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: Although the patient's hypertension and tachycardia have improved, there is still a potential for them"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted due to acute respiratory distress and has been in the ICU since then. The patient's main issues include respiratory distress, hypertension, and tachycardia. She has undergone two bronchoscopies and is currently on assist-control ventilation due to failed spontaneous breathing trials. Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are being monitored, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and MRSA. Other medical conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and anxiety are also being managed. The patient's recent lab results show slightly abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, and electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiectasis may worsen her respiratory function, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: Despite being on antihypertensive medications, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. If not adequately controlled, it could lead to end-organ damage and increase the risk of cardiac events.
3. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Close monitoring of these conditions is necessary to prevent complications"

","The patient is a well-nourished, anxious individual who is currently being treated in the ICU. They have a history of hypertension, benign; altered mental status (not delirium); anxiety; respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS); hypothyroidism; GERD; anemia, other; tachycardia, other; hypotension (not shock); and acidosis, respiratory.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/64 mmHg to 160/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg. The patient is receiving propofol infusion at 35 mcg/kg/min and has been given various medications, including heparin sodium prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flow sheet data shows that the patient has been receiving fluids and blood products, with a total in of 2,459 mL and total out of 2,550 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, RR set at 22 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and ABG results of pH 7.47, PaCO2 53 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 273.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished, anxious appearance, normal eyes/conjunctiva, normocephalic head/ears/nose/throat, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion note, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, and sedated neurologic status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include electrolyte & fluid disorder, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, benign hypertension, altered mental status, anxiety, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypothyroidism, GERD, other anemia, other tachycardia, hypotension (not shock), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient is also diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary tube, glycemic control, and arterial line for monitoring. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer,"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F h/o bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent, COPD with 2L
   02 requirement, pseudomonal URI cxs ([**10-30**]) p/w acute respiratory
   distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**1-23**] COPD exacerbation with underlying
   component of tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiactesis. Initial
   bronchoscopy showed granulation tissue, appropriate Y-stent placement.
   CTA negative for PE, showed some ?fluid beneath stent. Thus, second
   bronchoscopy was done which showed some secretions around stent/ETT
   which was suctioned, mild repositioning of stent (higher up). Failed
   RSBI and PSV again yesterday and this morning. Has auto-PEEP of 5 due
   to breath stacking. Now on Assist Control again.
   - Will try to optimize patient for weaning: antibiotics, steroids,
   nebs, positioning, anxiety management
   - Watch for auto-PEEP and breath stacking
   - Standing NEBs
   - Prednisone 60mg (Day 2 Pred from Solumedrol 125mg IV q8 taper)
   - Broad specturm antibiotics to cover HAP PNA (Vanc, Meropenem,
   Levaquin for atypicals); Day [**4-30**] given MRSA+ screen.
   - Monitor I/O
   # Hypertension/tachycardia: Improved since changed to Propofol, with
   Fentanyl boluses prn (25 mcg). Does become hypertensive when ventilator
   weaning attempted.
   - Continue with Propofol
   - Fentanyl boluses PRN
   - Restarted Lopressor [**Hospital1 7**] and increased to home dose (25mg [**Hospital1 7**]); will
   hold Norvasc given good blood pressure control
   .
   # Tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stent placement: continue outpatient
   stent care.
   - Guaifenesin 600 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]
   - Acetylcysteine 20 % (200 mg/mL) Q 8H
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Now on home lopressor dose
   - Follow blood and urine cultures
   - Daily CXR
   # Acid Base Status: Respiratory acidosis resolved.
   - Trend ABG, CO2 improving now on vent.
   .
   # Anemia: Bumped appropriately to one unit pRBC and now stable in low
   30s
   - Active T&S
   - Trend HCT daily
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: 144 from baseline 300. Most likely etiology
   infection, sepsis or dilutional effect. Normal coags, therefore
   unlikely DIC. No renal failure to suggest TTP
   - Trend daily
   .
   # PT: She is a good candidate for PT and OOB.
   .
   # HTN: outpatient Atenolol
   # GERD: Omeprazole and Sucralfate
   # Hypothyroid: outpatient Levothyroxine
   # Hyperlipidemia: outpatient Simvastatin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring 2L oxygen. She was admitted due to acute respiratory distress and was found to have granulation tissue during bronchoscopy, which led to Y-stent placement. The patient also has hypertension, anxiety, and other medical conditions.

The patient's current condition shows she is on assist control ventilation with a FiO2 of 30% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. She has been experiencing episodes of increased lopressor, hypertension, tachycardia, and agitation. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis, and she has an elevated lactate level.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying COPD exacerbation, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis can lead to recurrent respiratory distress. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Daily chest X-rays and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.

3. Sepsis: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated lactate level suggest possible sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD who is currently admitted to the ICU. She required intubation due to acute respiratory distress caused by a pseudomonal urinary tract infection. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypertension and tachycardia during spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), indicating ongoing respiratory distress. There is also an anxiety component to her respiratory distress, which may be exacerbated by steroid use.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to show signs of respiratory distress, as evidenced by hypertension and tachycardia during SBTs. She remains on assist control ventilation to support her breathing.

2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are elevated, particularly during attempts to wean her off the ventilator. This could be due to anxiety or other factors.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, but it appears to be stable.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but it is considered stable with no active bleeding observed.

5. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which has been managed with Y-stent placement and outpatient stent care.

6. GERD: The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD who was admitted with acute respiratory distress due to a pseudomonal urinary tract infection (URI). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and synchronized intermittent mandatory breaths (SIMB). The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and has received treatment with Lasix for peripheral edema and increased peripheral edema.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 136/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on FiO2 of 40%. The patient's physical examination reveals soft and clear lung sounds, warm extremities, and no evidence of jugular venous distention.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values including kidney function, liver function tests, electrolytes, and cardiac markers are also within normal limits.

The patient's current assessment indicates that she is improving with diuresis and shows signs of fluid overload. The medical team is considering a repeat spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this afternoon to assess her readiness for ext"

The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced another episode of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) at 1 am.
- Lasix 20 IV diuresis was administered due to positive 10L loss of sodium and increased peripheral edema, resulting in a reduction of 2L.
- Ativan was ordered as per [**Hospital1 7**].
- The patient's gas analysis showed increased alkalosis, leading to a decrease in the ventilator rate.
- The patient was changed from assist control (AC) to pressure support (PS) at 0100, with sedation, and tolerated it well.
- During a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning, the patient became tachycardic, hypertensive, and agitated, so he was placed back on PS 18/5.

Allergies:
- The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), leading to an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Since admission, the patient has had several episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and has received treatment with Lasix for peripheral edema.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 136/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 214.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.7 K/uL and slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 38 mg/dL. Other lab values, including hemoglobin (Hb), platelet"

   tachycardic with SBT's, although RSBI was improving. Status seemed to
   be improving with diuresis, she is +6-7L LOS. COPD/bronchiectasis
   exacerbation vs fluid overload. Reintubated this morning after
   fatiguing. Family updated.
   - bronchoscopy today to assess positioning of ETT/Y-stent
   - Increase sedation given dyssynchrony with vent this morning
   - Watch for auto-PEEP and breath stacking
   - Standing NEBs
   - Touch base with IP re: positioning of Y-stent
   - taper steroids

   Levaquin for atypicals; all started on [**2-10**]) and MRSA+ screen. Now Day
   [**7-31**].
   - Monitor I/O
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
    # Tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stent placement: S/p 2 bronchoscopies.
   Continue outpatient stent care (Guaifenesin, Acetylcysteine)
   - Stent in place by bronch
   # Hypertension/tachycardia: Most elevated with attempts to wean
   ventilator. Otherwise in moderately good control. Since these changes
   are associated with attempts to wean, likely represent not so much
   anxiety as respiratory distress

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted with acute respiratory distress due to a pseudomonal urinary tract infection (URI) and required invasive ventilation. The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of tachycardia and hypertension, particularly during spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), indicating potential respiratory distress. She has been treated with diuretics for peripheral edema and sedation for agitation. A bronchoscopy is planned to assess the positioning of the endotracheal tube (ETT)/Y-stent.

The patient has several comorbidities including anemia, thrombocytopenia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and anxiety. She is currently on multiple medications such as Lasix, Ativan, nitroglycerin, and heparin prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3°C, heart rate 91 bpm, blood pressure 207/97 mmHg, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 72 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 326.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, benign, anxiety, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypothyroidism, GERD, anemia (other), tachycardia (other), hypotension (not shock), acidosis (respiratory), COPD with acute exacerbation, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical events, including episodes of AVNRT, hypertensive crises, reintubation, and severe electrolyte imbalances. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has shown signs of impaired aerobic capacity, airway clearance, balance, gait, muscle performance, transfers, and ventilation. The patient's mental status has been altered, but not delirium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's impaired airway clearance and ventilation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and recent hypertensive crises put him at risk for cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates a current or recent infection. There is a risk of developing further infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   - Monitor I/O
    # Tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stent placement: S/p 2 bronchoscopies.
   Continue outpatient stent care (Guaifenesin, Acetylcysteine)
   - Stent in place by bronch
   # Hypertension/tachycardia: Most elevated with attempts to wean
   ventilator. Otherwise in moderately good control. Since these changes
   are associated with attempts to wean, likely represent not so much
   anxiety as respiratory distress

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted due to acute respiratory distress and required invasive ventilation. She experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, tachycardia, and anemia. The patient underwent two bronchoscopies and had a Y-stent placement. She was reintubated after failing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and showing signs of respiratory distress. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, and altered mental status. She is currently on various medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not improve with diuresis and continues to experience fluid overload.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's elevated blood pressure and heart rate may indicate ongoing stress on the cardiovascular system, which could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if invasive procedures are performed.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could contribute to fatigue and poor tissue perfusion, potentially leading to further complications.
5. Hypothyroidism: Untreated hypothyroidism can"

   Respiratory failure:  Severe COPD, TBM.  Required reintubation for
   respiratory distress.   Had been aggressively diuresed before
   extubation, pulmonary
   edema less likely cause.  can check cardiac enzymes to r/o ischemia.
   That would suggest underlying disease is major cause of recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   Currently is having increased effort and looks uncomfortable on the
   [**Last Name (LF) 494**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] try to sedate her more heavily.
   - start weaning steroids as she is on a high dose.
   TBM:  has Y-stent, ETT is not telescoped into stent - will contact IP
   on whether ETT should be advanced into stent.

   distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Reintubated yesterday, cardiac enzymes flat
   suggestive of primary pulmonary disease/fatiguing causing respiratory
   distress and need to reintubate. Continues to become hypertensive and
   tachycardic with SBT's, although RSBI was improving. Tolerated brief
   PSV trial this morning on Fentanyl/Versed but concern for oversedation.
   Status seemed to be improving with diuresis, she is +6-7L LOS.
   COPD/bronchiectasis exacerbation vs fluid overload. Reintubated
   yesterday after fatiguing. Family updated and would like to be at
   bedside when extubated.
   - Watch for auto-PEEP and breath stacking
   - Lasix diuresis again today for goal -1L for optimizing respiratory
   status prior to repeat trial extubation
   - Standing NEBs
   - Taper steroids
   - Broad specturm antibiotics to cover HAP PNA (Vanc, Meropenem,
   Levaquin for atypicals; all started on [**2-10**]) and MRSA+ screen. Now Day
   [**8-31**].
   - Monitor I/O
    # Tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stent placement: S/p 2 bronchoscopies.
   Continue outpatient stent care (Guaifenesin, Acetylcysteine)
   - Stent in place by bronch
   # Hypertension/tachycardia: Most elevated with attempts to wean
   ventilator. Otherwise in good control and hypotensive intermittently on
   sedation. Since these changes are associated with attempts to wean,
   likely represent not so much anxiety as respiratory distress. Does have
   anxiety when extubated and off sedation.
   - Continue home Lopressor for rate control, with holding parameters
   - Holding other anti-hypertensives, now that BP has dropped with
   intubation/sedation (was switched to Fentanyl/versed from Propofol
   overnight to manage intermittent hypotension)
   .
   # Anemia: Stable. No active bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, and pseudomonal urinary tract infection. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and reintubated yesterday due to respiratory fatigue. The patient has been experiencing hypertension and tachycardia during spontaneous breathing trials, suggesting primary pulmonary disease or fluid overload. She tolerated a brief pressure support ventilation trial but there were concerns about oversedation. The family has been updated and wishes to be at the bedside when extubation is attempted again.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience further respiratory distress due to her underlying conditions (COPD, bronchiectasis) and reintubation.
2. Hypertension and Tachycardia: The patient may continue to have episodes of hypertension and tachycardia, especially during attempts to wean from mechanical ventilation.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient may develop fluid overload, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a potential risk for bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly low, indicating a possible risk for decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and"

   78F h/o bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent, COPD with 2L
   02 requirement, pseudomonal URI cxs ([**10-30**]) p/w acute respiratory
   distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Continues to become hypertensive and
   tachycardic with SBT's, although RSBI was improving. Status seemed to
   be improving with diuresis, she is +6-7L LOS. COPD/bronchiectasis
   exacerbation vs fluid overload. Reintubated this morning after
   fatiguing. Family updated.
   - bronchoscopy today to assess positioning of ETT/Y-stent
   - Increase sedation given dyssynchrony with vent this morning
   - Watch for auto-PEEP and breath stacking
   - Standing NEBs
   - Touch base with IP re: positioning of Y-stent
   - taper steroids
   - Broad specturm antibiotics to cover HAP PNA (Vanc, Meropenem,
   Levaquin for atypicals; all started on [**2-10**]) and MRSA+ screen. Now Day
   [**7-31**].
   - Monitor I/O
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
    # Tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stent placement: S/p 2 bronchoscopies.
   Continue outpatient stent care (Guaifenesin, Acetylcysteine)
   - Stent in place by bronch
   # Hypertension/tachycardia: Most elevated with attempts to wean
   ventilator. Otherwise in moderately good control. Since these changes
   are associated with attempts to wean, likely represent not so much
   anxiety as respiratory distress
   - Continue home Lopressor for rate control
   - Holding other anti-hypertensives, now that BP has dropped with
   intubation/sedation
   .
   # Anemia: Stable. No active bleeding.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend HCT daily
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable
   - Trend daily

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD. She has been admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and was initially placed on noninvasive ventilation. However, she deteriorated and required reintubation.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypertension and tachycardia, which worsen during attempts to wean from the ventilator.
- Respiratory distress, possibly due to COPD exacerbation or fluid overload.
- Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 10.1 K/uL.
- Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL.
- Hypernatremia with a sodium level of 148 mEq/L.
- Elevated creatinine level of 1.57 mg/dL.
- Elevated white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL.
- Elevated troponin-T level of 0.02 mg/dL, indicating possible cardiac injury.
- Elevated lactate level of 0.6 mmol/L, suggesting possible tissue hypoperfusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and risk factors.
3. Stress ulcer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and underwent reintubation due to respiratory failure. The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, suggesting a primary pulmonary disease rather than a cardiac cause for the respiratory distress. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress and required reintubation. There is concern for COPD/bronchiectasis exacerbation versus fluid overload.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient experiences elevated blood pressure and heart rate during attempts to wean from the ventilator. This may be due to respiratory distress rather than anxiety.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, with no active bleeding. Trending HCT daily is recommended.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is improving. Daily trends are advised.
5. GERD: The patient has been prescribed famotidine and sucralfate for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
6. Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine is recommended for the patient's hypothyroidism.
7. Hyperlipidemia: Simvastatin is prescribed to manage the patient's high lipid levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis, tracheobronchomalacia post Y-stent placement, COPD, and pseudomonal urinary tract infection. She was admitted with acute respiratory distress and reintubated yesterday due to fatiguing and respiratory distress. Her cardiac enzymes are flat, suggesting primary pulmonary disease. She is hypertensive and tachycardic during spontaneous breathing trials but tolerates brief pressure support ventilation trial this morning. The family wishes to be at the bedside when extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to experience respiratory distress, which may require further interventions such as additional diuresis and optimization of respiratory status before considering extubation.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient has episodes of hypertension and tachycardia, particularly during attempts to wean the ventilator. These symptoms may indicate ongoing respiratory distress or anxiety.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but it should be monitored closely, and transfusion should be considered if there is active bleeding or significant symptoms.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable, and platelet levels should be trended daily.
5. GERD: The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and medication management with famotidine and sucralfate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with respiratory failure due to COPD, bronchiectasis, and a tracheobronchial stent. She was extubated on Friday but had to be reintubated over the weekend. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for a while, but today showed signs of respiratory failure. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, pressure-controlled ventilation with PSV/SBT mode, PEEP at 0 cmH2O, FiO2 at 45%, and a RSBI of 86. Her physical examination reveals paradox, tachycardia, hypertension, edema, and a soft abdomen. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 140 bpm, blood pressure of 180 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation/bronchiectasis exacerbation, tachycardia, and hypertension. The plan includes rechecking RSBI/SBT daily, providing respiratory support, managing COPD exacerbation with steroids and bronchodilators, completing the antibiotic course, and considering the removal of the tracheobronchial stent. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition through tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. She has been reintubated over the weekend and is currently tolerating a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient has multiple medical allergies including anaphylaxis to sulfa antibiotics, Lipitor (atorvastatin), and hepatic toxicity. 

She has received several antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin. The patient is receiving various medications in the ICU, including midazolam, fentanyl, furosemide, famotidine, metoprolol, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/57 to 180/139 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a PSV/SBT mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 267 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 45%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 86. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 218, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 98, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 43 mEq/L, and base excess of -18.

The patient's physical examination reveals paradoxical movement, tachycardia, hypertension, edema, and a soft abdomen. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and troponin T levels, along with slightly low sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) levels. Her renal function tests indicate a creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 43 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and fluid overload due to the patient's high fluid intake and low urine output. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78yF with COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis and previous
   ESBL UTI and pseudamonal respiratory cultures ([**10-30**]) admitted for
   respiratory distress with improving respiratory status but continued
   difficulty in weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory distress--likely secondary to COPD exacerbation
   secondary to infection. Difficult to wean off ventilator with
   tachycardia and hypertension during SBTs. RSBIs <105, currently on PSV.
   - Continue to monitor RSBI
   - Will repeat SBT tomorrow morning and aim for extubation then.
   - Continue vanc/levo/[**Last Name (un) 614**] for now (patient has completed 10-day course
   for MRSA/atypial/pseuodamonal PNA, respectively) but given clinical
   condition hold on stopping antibiotics and wait on cultures
   - Taper IV methylprednisolone to prednisolone 60mg PO QD; patient has
   been on IV methylprednisolone for nearly 10 days.
   - On albuterol and ipratropium nebs q4h
   - continue to diurese (lasix 40mg IV x1 today for goal -1L); although
   CVP is low, TBB for yesterday was positive.
   #) LEUKOCYTOSIS--Leukocyte count 11.2
 16 on [**2-19**] <-- 10.1 previous
   day, currently 11.2. Unclear source of infection, although UA showed
   protein, [**2-23**] WBC, and moderate yeast. Patient has had Foley in place
   and in addition has been on high-dose IV steroids and broad-spectrum
   abx for 10 days so is susceptible to fungal infection. C. diff also a
   possibility.
   - Trend WBC count and monitor fever curve.
   - F/u C. diff toxin, urine cultures, blood cultures before beginning
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Re-send respiratory culture (contaminated upper respiratory sample)
   - If spikes, would re-culture and potentially consider empiric
   anti-fungals.
   - change out foley
   #) Hypertension--hypertension during SBT likely secondary to
   respiratory distress and anxiety. On ventilator BPs have remained
   within acceptable range.
   - Holding lopressor (home atenolol dose 50mg QD)
   #) Tachycardia--tachycardia during SBT.
   #) Anxiety--switched from midazolam/fentanyl to propofol with fentanyl
   PRN.
   - On mirtazapine
   - restart home ativan today (0.25mg q6h PRN)
   #) Elevated blood sugar--likely secondary to steroid use, should
   improve with steroid taper
   - Continue on insulin sliding scale
   #) Tracheobronchomalacia--s/p bronch confirming patent stent.
   - Continue guaifenisen
   #) Anemia--s/p 1U PRBCs on [**2-10**]; Hct stable at 30-32.
   #) Hypothyroidism
   - On home levothyroxine dose
   #) FEN--Na responded to free water flushes, currently stable at 137.
   - Continue free water flushes 100ml q6h.
   #) GERD--on famotidine, stopped sucralfate
   #) DVT ppx--SCH TID, pneumoboots
   #) Access: Radial line, CVL
    - remove CVL
   #) Code: Full
   #) Dispo: transfer to floor if successfully extubated. Speak to family
   re: possibility of trache/PEG in case of difficult extubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   78yF with COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis and previous
   ESBL UTI and pseudamonal respiratory cultures ([**10-30**]) admitted for
   respiratory distress with improving respiratory status but continued
   difficulty in weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory distress--likely secondary to COPD exacerbation
   secondary to infection. Difficult to wean off ventilator with
   tachycardia and hypertension during SBTs. RSBIs <105, currently on PSV.
   - Continue to monitor RSBI
   - Will repeat SBT tomorrow morning and aim for extubation then.
   - Continue vanc/levo/[**Last Name (un) 614**] for now (patient has completed 10-day course
   for MRSA/atypial/pseuodamonal PNA, respectively) but given clinical
   condition hold on stopping antibiotics and wait on cultures
   - Taper IV methylprednisolone to prednisolone 60mg PO QD; patient has
   been on IV methylprednisolone for nearly 10 days.
   - On albuterol and ipratropium nebs q4h
   - continue to diurese (lasix 40mg IV x1 today for goal -1L); although
   CVP is low, TBB for yesterday was positive.
   #) LEUKOCYTOSIS--Leukocyte count 11.2
 16 on [**2-19**] <-- 10.1 previous
   day, currently 11.2. Unclear source of infection, although UA showed
   protein, [**2-23**] WBC, and moderate yeast. Patient has had Foley in place
   and in addition has been on high-dose IV steroids and broad-spectrum
   abx for 10 days so is susceptible to fungal infection. C. diff also a
   possibility.
   - Trend WBC count and monitor fever curve.
   - F/u C. diff toxin, urine cultures, blood cultures before beginning
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Re-send respiratory culture (contaminated upper respiratory sample)
   - If spikes, would re-culture and potentially consider empiric
   anti-fungals.
   - change out foley
   #) Hypertension--hypertension during SBT likely secondary to
   respiratory distress and anxiety. On ventilator BPs have remained
   within acceptable range.
   - Holding lopressor (home atenolol dose 50mg QD)
   #) Tachycardia--tachycardia during SBT.
   #) Anxiety--switched from midazolam/fentanyl to propofol with fentanyl
   PRN.
   - On mirtazapine
   - restart home ativan today (0.25mg q6h PRN)
   #) Elevated blood sugar--likely secondary to steroid use, should
   improve with steroid taper
   - Continue on insulin sliding scale
   #) Tracheobronchomalacia--s/p bronch confirming patent stent.
   - Continue guaifenisen
   #) Anemia--s/p 1U PRBCs on [**2-10**]; Hct stable at 30-32.
   #) Hypothyroidism
   - On home levothyroxine dose
   #) FEN--Na responded to free water flushes, currently stable at 137.
   - Continue free water flushes 100ml q6h.
   #) GERD--on famotidine, stopped sucralfate
   #) DVT ppx--SCH TID, pneumoboots
   #) Access: Radial line, CVL
    - Picc line; remove CVL.
   #) Code: Full
   #) Dispo: transfer to floor if successfully extubated. Speak to family
   re: possibility of trache/PEG in case of difficult extubation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis. She was admitted for respiratory distress and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, sedatives, and respiratory support.

Summary of the note:
- The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator, with tachycardia and hypertension during spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs).
- She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for an extended period, which increases her risk for fungal infections.
- The leukocyte count has increased, indicating a possible infection.
- The patient has been on high-dose IV steroids, which can cause elevated blood sugar levels.
- She also has hypertension and anxiety, and her tracheobronchomalacia has been addressed with a stent placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Fungal infection: The prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics increases the risk of fungal infections, particularly since yeast was found in the urine analysis.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The use of high-dose IV steroids can disrupt the normal gut flora and increase the risk of C. diff infection.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, bronchiectasis, and previous ESBL UTI and pseudomonal respiratory cultures. He was admitted for respiratory distress, which has improved but still has difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 97/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's recent laboratory results show a WBC count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 161 mg/dL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory distress - likely secondary to COPD exacerbation due to infection. Difficult to wean off ventilator with tachycardia and hypertension during SBTs. RSBI <105, currently on PSV and CPAP.
2) Leukocytosis - leukocyte count 16 on [**2-19**], currently 11.2. Unclear source of infection, although UA showed protein, [**2-23**] WBC, and moderate yeast. Patient susceptible to fungal infection due to high-dose IV steroids and broad-spectrum"

   Assessment and Plan
   78yF with COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis and previous
   ESBL UTI and pseudamonal respiratory cultures ([**10-30**]) admitted for
   respiratory distress with improving respiratory status but continued
   difficulty in weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory distress--likely secondary to COPD exacerbation
   secondary to infection. Difficult to wean off ventilator with
   tachycardia and hypertension during SBTs. RSBIs <105, currently on PSV
   and CPAP.
   - Continue to monitor RSBI, if anxiety level low in PM, may try another
   SBT, likely not until tomorrow
   - Continue vanc/levo/[**Last Name (un) 614**] for now (patient has completed 10-day course
   for MRSA/atypial/pseuodamonal PNA, respectively) but given clinical
   condition hold on stopping antibiotics and wait on cultures
   - Taper IV methylprednisolone to prednisolone 60mg PO QD; patient has
   been on IV methylprednisolone for nearly 10 days.
   - On albuterol and ipratropium nebs q4h
   - Bronchiectasis rx --> chest physotherapy, IV fluid bolus of 500cc
   since CVP low at 1.
   - continue to diurese
   #) LEUKOCYTOSIS--Leukocyte count 11.2
 16 on [**2-19**] <-- 10.1 previous
   day, currently 11.2. Unclear source of infection, although UA showed
   protein, [**2-23**] WBC, and moderate yeast. Patient has had Foley in place
   and in addition has been on high-dose IV steroids and broad-spectrum
   abx for 10 days so is susceptible to fungal infection. C. diff also a
   possibility.
   - Trend WBC count and monitor fever curve.
   - F/u C. diff toxin, urine cultures, blood cultures before beginning
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Re-send respiratory culture (contaminated upper respiratory sample)
   - If spikes, would re-culture and potentially consider empiric
   anti-fungals.
   - change out foley
   #) Hypertension--hypertension during SBT likely secondary to
   respiratory distress and anxiety. On ventilator BPs have remained
   within acceptable range.
   - Holding lopressor (home atenolol dose 50mg QD)
   #) Tachycardia--tachycardia during SBT.
   #) Anxiety--switched from midazolam/fentanyl to propofol with fentanyl
   PRN.
   - On mirtazapine
   - restart home ativan today
   #) Elevated blood sugar--likely secondary to steroid use, should
   improve with steroid taper
   - Continue on insulin sliding scale
   #) Tracheobronchomalacia--s/p bronch confirming patent stent.
   - Continue guaifenisen
   #) Anemia--s/p 1U PRBCs on [**2-10**]; Hct stable at 30-32.
   #) Hypothyroidism
   - On home levothyroxine dose
   #) FEN--Na responded to free water flushes, currently stable at 137.
   - Continue free water flushes 100ml q6h.
   #) GERD--on famotidine, stopped sucralfate
   #) DVT ppx--SCH TID, pneumoboots
   #) Access: Radial line, CVL
    - remove CVL
   #) Code: Full
   #) Dispo: transfer to floor if successfully extubated.

   Assessment and Plan
   78yF with COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis and previous
   ESBL UTI and pseudamonal respiratory cultures ([**10-30**]) admitted for
   respiratory distress with improving respiratory status but continued
   difficulty in weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory distress--ikely secondary to COPD exacerbation secondary
   to infection. Difficult to wean off ventilator with tachycardia and
   hypertension during SBTs. RSBIs <105, currently on PSV and CPAP.
   - Continue to monitor RSBI, if anxiety level low in PM, may try another
   SBT.
   - Discontinue vanc/levo/[**Last Name (un) 614**] as patient has completed 10-day course for
   MRSA/atypial/pseuodamonal PNA, respectively.
   - Taper IV methylprednisolone to prednisolone 60mg PO QD; patient has
   been on IV methylprednisolone for nearly 10 days.
   - On albuterol and ipratropium nebs q4h
   - Bronchiectasis rx --> chest physotherapy, IV fluid bolus of 500cc
   since CVP low at 1.
   #) LEUKOCYTOSIS--Leukocyte count 16 on [**2-19**] <-- 10.1 previous day,
   currently 11.2. Unclear source of infection, although UA showed
   protein, [**2-23**] WBC, and moderate yeast. Patient has had Foley in place
   and in addition has been on high-dose IV steroids and broad-spectrum
   abx for 10 days so is susceptible to fungal infection. C. diff also a
   possibility.
   - Trend WBC count and monitor fever curve.
   - F/u C. diff toxin, urine cultures, blood cultures before beginning
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Re-send respiratory culture (contaminated upper respiratory sample)
   - If spikes, would re-culture and potentially consider empiric
   anti-fungals.
   #) Hypertension--hypertension during SBT likely secondary to
   respiratory distress and anxiety. On ventilator BPs have remained
   within acceptable range.
   - Holding lopressor (home atenolol dose 50mg QD)
   #) Tachycardia--tachycardia during SBT.
   #) Anxiety--switched from midazolam/fentanyl to propofol with fentanyl
   PRN.
   - On mirtazapine
   - Home ativan held
   #) Elevated blood sugar--likely secondary to steroid use, should
   improve with steroid taper
   - Continue on insulin sliding scale
   #) Tracheobronchomalacia--s/p bronch confirming patent stent.
   - Continue guaifenisen
   #) Anemia--s/p 1U PRBCs on [**2-10**]; Hct stable at 30-32.
   #) Hypothyroidism
   - On home levothyroxine dose
   #) FEN--Na responded to free water flushes, currently stable at 137.
   - Continue free water flushes 100ml q6h.
   #) GERD--on famotidine and sucralfate
   #) DVT ppx--SCH TID, pneumoboots
   #) Access: Radial line, CVL
   #) Code: Full
   #) Dispo: transfer to floor if successfully extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, bronchiectasis, and previous ESBL UTI and pseudomonal respiratory cultures. She was admitted for respiratory distress but has shown improvement in her respiratory status. However, she continues to have difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The patient's medical conditions include leukocytosis, hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, hyperglycemia, tracheobronchomalacia, anemia, hypothyroidism, and GERD. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's difficulty in weaning off the ventilator suggests ongoing respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD exacerbation due to infection. Close monitoring of respiratory status and further interventions may be required.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count indicates an infection. Since she has been on high-dose IV steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics for 10 days, she is susceptible to fungal infections. Trending the WBC count and monitoring fever curve is important, and follow-up cultures should be done before starting antibiotic coverage.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension during spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) is likely secondary to respiratory distress and anxiety. It is necessary to continue monitoring blood pressure and adjust treatment accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:
   78yF with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia who presented with respiratory
   distress and continued difficulty weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory distress--COPD. Failed numerous SBTs and increased
   pressure support over night.
   - SBT this AM and plan for extubation; if fails will discuss with
   family tomorrow the possibility of tracheostomy
   - Continue steroids
   - Abx: completed 11 days on vanc/levo/[**Last Name (un) 614**]; CXR clear and no concerning
   sputum. If she had PNA it has likely cleared although her temp has run
   somewhat high (99.9). Will continue abx for now.
   - Volume status: CVP 7-10 yesterday PM when hypertensive/tachycardic.
   This likely does not represent true volume overload but rather elevated
   intrathoracic pressures
 elecated RVEDP
 increased CVP. Patient did
   not meet -1L diuresis goal yesterday, so would try gentle diuresis of
   lasix 20mg IV for goal -1L today.
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium q4h
   #) Candidal UTI most likely responsible for increase in WBC count and
   fever spike three days ago. Foley changed. Although we have no clear
   indication that she is symptomatic from this infection, plan to treat
   given presence of Foley, observed leukocytosis and fever, and relative
   immunosuppression on steroids.
   - Begin fluconazole 200mg IV PO QD
   - Continue to follow-up on other micro data (c. diff, blood cultures,
   respiratory cultures).
   #) Anxiety--secondary to baseline anxiety, respiratory distress, and
   discomfort on ventilator.
   - Continue propofol and standing doses of ativan with fentanyl boluses
   as needed.
   - On mirtazapine
   #) Elevated blood sugar--secondary to steroid use. Expect to taper
   steroids, although may benefit more aggressive blood-sugar control.
   -
   #) Blood pressure and tachycardia--most pronounced when family is
   present and when patient is interactive, likely secondary to
   respiratory distress and discomfort.
   - Keep lopressor dose as is (25mg [**Hospital1 7**]) given that patient also has low
   BPs in 80s.
   - Reassess vital signs, may need to increase pressure support if
   continues to be hypertensive/tachycardic.
   #) Anemia--Hct stable at 29.9.
   #) FEN--tube feed rate increased from 30ml/hr to 40ml/hr per nutrition
   recs.
   - Replete Mg 2mg IV
   #) GERD
   - on famotidine
   #) DVT ppx
   - Heparin 5000U SC TID
   #) Access: radial line, CVL
   - Picc order placed, will d/c CVL once Picc is in place
   #) Code: full
   #) Communication: daughters. To meet tomorrow if extubation difficult
   today for discussion of tracheostomy.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia who presented with respiratory distress and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. She has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, steroids, and diuretics. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/72 to 173/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. She is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 262 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 190 mg/dL, likely due to steroid use. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, along with her current respiratory distress, puts her at risk for further respiratory complications. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Regular assessment of her sputum culture and chest X-ray will help monitor for any signs of infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:
   78yF with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia who presented with respiratory
   distress and continued difficulty weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory distress--COPD. Failed numerous SBTs and increased
   pressure support over night.
   - SBT this AM and plan for extubation; if fails will discuss with
   family tomorrow the possibility of tracheostomy
   - Continue steroids
   - Abx: completed 11 days on vanc/levo/[**Last Name (un) 614**]; CXR clear and no concerning
   sputum. If she had PNA it has likely cleared although her temp has run
   somewhat high (99.9). Will continue abx for now.
   - Volume status: CVP 7-10 yesterday PM when hypertensive/tachycardic.
   This likely does not represent true volume overload but rather elevated
   intrathoracic pressures
 elecated RVEDP
 increased CVP. Patient did
   not meet -1L diuresis goal yesterday, so would try gentle diuresis of
   lasix 20mg IV for goal -1L today.
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium q4h
   #) Candidal UTI most likely responsible for increase in WBC count and
   fever spike three days ago. Foley changed. Although we have no clear
   indication that she is symptomatic from this infection, plan to treat
   given presence of Foley, observed leukocytosis and fever, and relative
   immunosuppression on steroids.
   - Begin fluconazole 200mg IV PO QD
   - Continue to follow-up on other micro data (c. diff, blood cultures,
   respiratory cultures).
   #) Anxiety--secondary to baseline anxiety, respiratory distress, and
   discomfort on ventilator.
   - Continue propofol and standing doses of ativan with fentanyl boluses
   as needed.
   - On mirtazapine
   #) Elevated blood sugar--secondary to steroid use. Expect to taper
   steroids, although may benefit more aggressive blood-sugar control.
   -
   #) Blood pressure and tachycardia--most pronounced when family is
   present and when patient is interactive, likely secondary to
   respiratory distress and discomfort.
   - Keep lopressor dose as is (25mg [**Hospital1 7**]) given that patient also has low
   BPs in 80s.
   - Reassess vital signs, may need to increase pressure support if
   continues to be hypertensive/tachycardic.
   #) Anemia--Hct stable at 29.9.
   #) FEN--tube feed rate increased from 30ml/hr to 40ml/hr per nutrition
   recs.
   - Replete Mg 2mg IV
   #) GERD
   - on famotidine
   #) DVT ppx

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia who presented with respiratory distress and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 115/72 mmHg and a heart rate of 88 bpm. The patient is receiving various medications including propofol, famotidine, heparin, and steroids. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose levels. The patient has been diagnosed with candidal UTI and anxiety, and is being treated accordingly. The patient's blood pressure and tachycardia are likely secondary to respiratory distress and discomfort. The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 29.9%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress - due to COPD and tracheobronchomalacia.
2. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator - the patient has been unsuccessful in several spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs).
3. Candidal UTI - the patient has an increased white blood cell count and fever spike, indicating a possible infection.
4. Anxiety - the patient is experiencing anxiety due to baseline anxiety, respiratory distress, and discomfort on the ventilator.
5. Elevated blood sugar - secondary to steroid use, which needs to be managed.
6. Hypertension and tachycardia - when the patient is interactive and when family is present, likely due to respiratory distress and discomfort"

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to experience difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to severe and irreversible COPD. There is no longer clear evidence of infection or fluid overload, but the respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) has increased.

2. Tracheostomy: The possibility of tracheostomy was discussed with the family, and it was agreed upon as a potential intervention. The patient's physician will follow up with an interventional pulmonologist (IP) to assess the feasibility of tracheostomy.

3. Steroids: The patient is receiving intravenous steroids, which will continue unless discontinued.

4. Antibiotics: The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and meropenem for infection control. The trough level of vancomycin is within the therapeutic range.

5. Nebulizers: The patient is receiving ipratropium/albuterol nebs for respiratory support.

   Assessment and Plan
   78yF with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia with Y stent who presented
   with respiratory distress and difficult weaning off ventilator.
   #) Respiratory distress--difficulty weaning from vent likely due to
   severe and irreversible COPD. No longer clear evidence of infection or
   fluid overload. RSBI increased.
   - Discussed possibility of tracheostomy with family. touch base with
   family re: their thoughts this afternoon
   - If patient and family would like tracheostomy, follow-up with IP. IP
   believes trach is possible.
   - Continue IV steroids
   - check diff given new leukocytosis
   - Continue vanc and [**Last Name (un) 614**] for now, likely stop later today, pending diff
   - vanc trough level 18.5 (fine)
   - Continue Ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   - give touch of lasix today
   #) Anxiety--secondary to baseline anxiety, respiratory distress, and
   discomfort on ventilator.
   - Continue propofol and PO ativan 0.5mg Q6h
   - On mirtazapine
   #) Possible candidal UTI--repeat UA unremarkable
   - Follow-up urine culture from changed Foley; hold off on anti-fungal
   treatment
   #) Blood sugar control--Finger stick range from 110-177 after
   increasing sliding scale.
   - Continue with this regimen, expect to down-titrate once steroids are
   d/c'ed.
   #) Hypertension and tachycardia
   #) Anemia--Hct stable at 29

   #) Leukocytosis--WBC count 18 <-- 13.3. Infectious etiology of concern,
   especially since antibiotics were discontinued yesterday and ?subtle
   interval opacification of left lower lung field on CXR yesterday. Of
   special concern is VAP with multi-resistant organism. Patient has
   remained afebrile, which is reassuring. [**Month (only) 51**] also be due to medication

   Assessment and Plan
   78yF with severe COPD, tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent placement, and
   previous pseudamonal respiratory cultures ([**10-30**]) who presented with
   respiratory distress and has been difficult to wean off mechanical
   ventilation.
   #) Respiratory distress--
   - Plan for trach and PEG today, is NPO (tube feeds held) and insulin is
   held
   - Methylpred 40mg q8 with transition to PO pred via G tube tomorrow
   - Continue standing nebs
   - Will keep vent settings somewhat stable today for procedures
   #) Leukocytosis--WBC count 18 <-- 13.3. Infectious etiology of concern,
   especially since antibiotics were discontinued yesterday and ?subtle
   interval opacification of left lower lung field on CXR yesterday. Of
   special concern is VAP with multi-resistant organism. Patient has
   remained afebrile, which is reassuring. [**Month (only) 51**] also be due to medication
   effect (steroids, heparin), but this would not fit within usual time
   course for development of leukocytosis on medications. C. diff
   negative.
   - Pan culture--blood, urine, respiratory
   - Repeat stool culture
   - Continue to f/u existing culture data: urine culture from [**1-23**] and
   blood culture from [**2-19**]
   - CXR stable
   - Consider  empiric abx coverage for VAP if changes in her CXR or
   clinical deterioration, f/u culture data
   #) Tachycardia--may be baseline anxiety but more concerning in the
   setting of increased leukocytosis for possible evolving infective
   picture.   [**Month (only) 51**] also be d/t alkalemia, hypovolemia.
   - Start on maintenance fluids in case volume down, especially since NPO
   for procedure
   - Continue to adjust vent settings to support HR/BP
   #) Hypotension
 somewhat lower overnight with increased propofol
 may
   become more of an issue with trach/PEG placement today and need for
   increased sedation.
   - continue to monitor
   - hold metoprolol
   - prepare phenylephrine drip for procedures as needed
   #) Impaired glucose control--expect improvement with tapering of
   steroids
   - Insulin held for NPO for procedure
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need to down-titrate sliding scale (4U --> 2U) as steroids are
   being tapered
   #) Anemia
Hct stable
   #) FEN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with severe COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and previous pseudomonal respiratory cultures. She presented with respiratory distress and has been difficult to wean off mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 102 bpm (with a range of 93-125 bpm), blood pressure of 95/61 mmHg (with a range of 72-156/111 mmHg), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (with a range of 13-34 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%.

The patient is on several medications, including propofol, heparin sodium, famotidine, methylprednisolone, and other medications as mentioned in the note.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.9 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 145 mg/dL, low sodium level of 130 mg/dL, normal potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, slightly elevated chloride level of 103 mEq/L, and normal bicarbonate level of 22 mEq/L. The patient also has elevated BUN and creatinine levels.

Imaging studies reveal multi-lumen stop at 10:30 AM on [**2153-2-22**], and the patient's chest X-ray from the previous day showed subtle interval opacification of the left lower lung field.

The patient's plan includes tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement today, with NPO (nothing by mouth) and insulin held. Methylprednisolone 40 mg will be given every eight hours, transitioning to oral prednisone via a gastrostomy tube tomorrow. The patient will continue with standing nebulizers and ventilator settings will be kept somewhat stable for procedures.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress, leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18 (up from 13.3), potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a multi-resistant organism, tachycardia, hypotension, impaired glucose control, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, VAP with a multi-resistant organism, further deterioration in leukocytosis, hypotension during tracheostomy and PEG placement, impaired glycemic control, and potential bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring, especially considering the planned procedures and the potential for complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tracheobronchomalacia, and previous pseudomonal respiratory cultures. She presented with respiratory distress and has been difficult to wean off mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on 02/23. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which may be related to the recent trach/PEG placement. The plan includes methylprednisolone administration, continuing standing nebs (nebulized treatments), and monitoring CPAP settings.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.9. Discontinuation of antibiotics and subtle interval opacification of the left lower lung field on chest X-ray raise suspicion for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with multi-resistant organism. However, the patient has been afebrile, and C. difficile negative. Follow-up cultures, chest X-ray stability, and consideration of empiric antibiotic coverage for VAP if there are changes in the CXR or clinical deterioration are planned.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to baseline anxiety or evolving infective processes. Other possible causes include alkalemia and hypovolemia. Maint"

   78yF with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia presenting with respiratory
   distress and difficult weaning from ventilator, now s/p trache and PEG.
   #) Respiratory distress--s/p tracheostomy and PEG placement
   - Continue with steroid taper (today is day 2 of Prednisone 40mg QD).
   - Continue standing nebs
   #) Tachycardia
most likely secondary to respiratory distress and
   anxiety. Infectious etiology less likely given that patient has
   remained afebrile for one week, no clear source of infection found, and
   WBC count has been down-trending.
   - If BP permits, resume home dose of lopressor (12.5
 25mg [**Hospital1 7**])
   - Optimize respiratory parameters on vent
   - Anxiety regimen: midazolam 12.5mg IV Q4h prn, fentanyl 12.5-25mg OV
   q4H prn, ativan 0.5mg q4h prn, standing ativan 0.5mg q6h.
   #) Hypertension
SBPs range from 120-150s range with occasional readings
   in 80s.
   - Increase lopressor
   - Continue to hold home dose of norvasc.
   #) Increased WBC count
WBC 11.9

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/76 to 156/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient's recent events include becoming hypotensive and tachycardic when pressure support was decreased from 12 to 10 cmH2O. The pressure support has been reset back to 12 cmH2O.

The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count of 16.0 K/uL, which is trending down. The hemoglobin level is 26.2 g/dL, and platelet count is 197 K/uL. The blood cultures are pending, and the sputum gram stain shows 4+ gram-negative rods, which is consistent with previous gram stains during this admission. The urine cultures 3/4 grew 10K-100K yeast, which was equivocal for infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   78yF with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia presenting with respiratory
   distress and difficult weaning from ventilator, now s/p trache and PEG.
   #) Respiratory distress--s/p tracheostomy and PEG placement. Difficult
   to decrease pressure support settings and wean off vent due to poor
   pulmonary pump function and patient
s anxiety.
   - Continue to adjust pressure support settings to try to wean off vent.
   - Trache mask trials
   - Continue with steroid taper (today is day 2 of Prednisone 40mg QD).
   - Continue standing nebs
   #) Anxiety
anxious at baseline, exacerbated by respiratory distress.
   - Anxiety regimen: standing ativan 0.5mg q6h, midazolam 12.5mg-25mg IV
   Q4h prn, fentanyl 12.5-25mcg Q4h prn, ativan 0.5mg q4h prn, olanzapine
   5mg TID prn
   #) Tachycardia
most likely secondary to respiratory distress and
   anxiety. Infectious etiology less likely given that patient has
   remained afebrile for one week, no clear source of infection found, and
   WBC count has been down-trending.
   - If BP permits, resume home dose of lopressor (12.5
 25mg [**Hospital1 7**])
   - Optimize respiratory parameters on vent
   - Manage anxiety as above.
   #) Increased WBC count

   #) Anemia
Hct 26.2, which is stable over last several days. Probably
   due to some bleeding during procedure.
   - Continue to monitor daily Hct.
   #) Hypertension
SBPs range from 120-150s range with occasional readings
   in 80s.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia presenting with respiratory distress and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. He has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient is experiencing anxiety, tachycardia, increased white blood cell count, impaired glucose control, anemia, hypertension, and tracheobronchomalacia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening respiratory distress, prolonged ventilator dependence, infection due to gram-negative rods, poor wound healing, pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pneumonia. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, adjust pressure support settings, and continue with trache mask trials to facilitate weaning off the ventilator. The patient's anxiety should be managed with the prescribed medications. Close attention should also be given to the patient's glycemic control, hemodynamic stability, and infection prevention. Regular monitoring of lab parameters and frequent reassessment of the patient's condition are necessary to ensure appropriate management and prevent potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia presenting with respiratory distress and difficult weaning from the ventilator. He underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/76 to 156/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 373 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 232. The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchi at the bases bilaterally, a soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm and well-perfused extremities. Laboratory findings indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 18.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies are pending.

   78yF with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia presenting with respiratory
   distress and difficult weaning from ventilator, now s/p trache and PEG.
   #) Respiratory distress--s/p tracheostomy and PEG placement. Difficult
   to decrease pressure support settings and wean off vent due to poor
   pulmonary pump function and patient
s anxiety.
   - Continue to adjust pressure support settings to try to wean off vent.
   - Trache mask trials
   - Continue with steroid taper (today is day 2 of Prednisone 40mg QD).
   - Continue standing nebs
   #) Anxiety
anxious at baseline, exacerbated by respiratory distress.
   - Anxiety regimen: standing ativan 0.5mg q6h, midazolam 12.5mg-25mg IV
   Q4h prn, fentanyl 12.5-25mcg Q4h prn, ativan 0.5mg q4h prn, olanzapine
   5mg TID prn
   - Will d/c midazolam to simplify anti-anxiety regimen
   #) Tachycardia
most likely secondary to respiratory distress and
   anxiety. Infectious etiology less likely given that patient has
   remained afebrile for one week, no clear source of infection found, and
   WBC count has been down-trending.
   - If BP permits, resume home dose of lopressor (12.5

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 78-year-old female with COPD and tracheobronchomalacia. She presented with respiratory distress and had difficulty weaning from the ventilator. She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement.

2. The patient is currently experiencing:
   - Respiratory distress: The plan is to continue weaning pressure support settings, perform trache-mask trials, and allow the patient to sit out of bed (OOB) in a chair.
   - Anxiety: The patient is anxious at baseline and this is exacerbated by respiratory distress. The anxiety regimen includes standing ativan 0.5mg q6h, fentanyl 12.5-25mcg Q4h prn, and olanzapine 5mg TID prn.
   - Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, most pronounced during interventions and less pronounced during periods of rest. It is likely secondary to anxiety and respiratory distress.
   - Intermittent hypertension: This is most likely secondary to anxiety.
   - Increased WBC count: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but it is not symptomatic for respiratory infection. There is colonization with gram-negative rods, but no signs of respiratory infection.
   - Impaired glucose control: Finger sticks within acceptable range.
   - Anemia: Hematocrit level"
