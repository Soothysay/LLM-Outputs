   status-post laproscopic sigmoid colectomy, with fevers, leukocytosis,
   shortness of breath, and tachycardia, taken to the OR today for leak
   around anastamosis, now transfered to ICU for further management,
   remaining intubated.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was kept intubated due to tachypnea
   post-operatively. Suspect this is multifactorial, but large role may be
   due to discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension. He
   also had a large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis and
   prominent vessels with possible over hydration. Now weaned off
   sedation, on 5 peep, 5 pressure support. Good RSBI and tolerating SBT.
   - plan for extubation pending CXR
   .
   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with nerve blocks (likely wearing off today), fentanyl
   boluses per surgery; zofran for nausea
   .
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   .
   #) Hypertension: Initially was markedly hypertensive upon arrival to
   ICU, suspect this was secondary to discomfort. Has improved markedly
   after placement on propofol (SBP 120-130).
   -          Monitor trend, holding antihypertensives at present in event
   patient becomes septic.
   #) Tachycardia: persistently sinus tachy even with fluids. ? due to
   poor pain control.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis status-post laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. He presented with fevers, leukocytosis, shortness of breath, and tachycardia, and underwent an operation for a leak around the anastomosis. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management and remains intubated.

From the 24-hour events, the patient had a fever of 101.6°F (58.7°C), tachycardia, and received antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam). The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), current temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/80 mmHg to 174/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (16.9 K/uL), leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and other abnormalities. The physical examination notes the presence of drains, pleural effusion, and prominent vessels.

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:
1) Respiratory failure: The patient was kept intubated due to post-operative tachypnea. The large pleural"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis status-post laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. He presented with fevers, leukocytosis, shortness of breath, and tachycardia, and was taken to the operating room for a leak around the anastomosis. He is now in the ICU for further management, remaining intubated.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was kept intubated due to post-operative tachypnea. The large pleural effusion, atelectasis, and possible overhydration may contribute to his respiratory distress. Current ABG results are acceptable on AC, FiO2 50%, indicating the need for close monitoring of respiratory function and possible adjustments in FiO2 and TV.
2. Sigmoid diverticulitis: The patient had a previous history of sigmoid diverticulitis and underwent a sigmoidectomy. The presence of a known leak and observed fecal material in the peritoneum suggests intra-abdominal infection. Monitoring for other possible sites of infection and signs of sepsis is crucial. Antibiotic coverage should be continued, and follow-up culture data should be monitored. Trends in fever curve, WBC count, lactate levels, and urine output should also be observed for evidence of evolving sepsis.
3. Hypertension: The patient initially presented with markedly elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 43 year old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis
   status-post laproscopic sigmoid colectomy, with fevers, leukocytosis,
   shortness of breath, and tachycardia, taken to the OR today for leak
   around anastamosis, now transfered to ICU for further management,
   remaining intubated.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was kept intubated due to tachypnea
   post-operatively. Suspect this is multifactorial, but large role may be
   due to discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension. He
   also had a large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis and
   prominent vessels with possible over hydration. Now weaned off
   sedation, on 5 peep, 5 pressure support. Good RSBI and tolerating SBT.
   - plan for extubation pending CXR
   .
   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with nerve blocks (likely wearing off today), fentanyl
   boluses per surgery; zofran for nausea
   .
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   .
   #) Hypertension: Initially was markedly hypertensive upon arrival to
   ICU, suspect this was secondary to discomfort. Has improved markedly
   after placement on propofol (SBP 120-130).
   -          Monitor trend, holding antihypertensives at present in event
   patient becomes septic.
   #) Tachycardia: persistently sinus tachy even with fluids. ? due to
   poor pain control.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis status-post laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. He presented with fevers, leukocytosis, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. The patient underwent an operation to address a leak around the anastomosis and was subsequently transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient remains intubated and is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension, large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis, and overhydration. The plan is to wean off sedation, provide 5 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and 5 cm H2O of pressure support. The patient has good respiratory system compliance and is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).

The patient also has leukocytosis and fevers, which are most likely caused by intra-abdominal infection due to the known leak and observed fecal material in the peritoneum. Monitoring for other possible sites of infection, such as pneumonia, is necessary. The patient is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn for antibiotic coverage.

Additionally, the patient has hypertension that has improved after the placement of propofol. The cause of tachycardia is unknown but may be due to poor pain control.

Other ongoing care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 43 year old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis
   status-post laproscopic sigmoid colectomy, with fevers, leukocytosis,
   shortness of breath, and tachycardia, taken to the OR today for leak
   around anastamosis, now transfered to ICU for further management,
   remaining intubated.
   #) Respiratory failure: Extubated without difficulty
   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with morphine IV, start PCA today as more awake
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   #) Hypertension:  Restart meds
   #) Tachycardia: persistently sinus tachy even with fluids. ? due to
   poor pain control.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis status-post laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. He presented with fevers, leukocytosis, shortness of breath, and tachycardia, leading to an operation for a leak around the anastomosis. The patient was then transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated but successfully extubated without difficulty.
2. Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory laparotomy for leak: Two drains have been placed for drainage after wash-out and repair.
3. Leukocytosis and fevers: These symptoms are most likely due to an intra-abdominal infection caused by the known leak and observed fecal material in the peritoneum. The patient is being monitored for other possible sources of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no indwelling lines) and signs of evolving sepsis.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be restarted with medication.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent sinus tachycardia may be due to poor pain control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the known leak and fecal material in the peritoneum, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Monitoring for"
