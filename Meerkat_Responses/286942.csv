   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 88 y/o male w/ a hx of MI s/p CABG x3, AF on coumadin, and
   CHF who presents with worsening lower extremity edema, found to have
   EKG concerning for critical conduction disease.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p MI with CABG.  No
   complaints of chest pain.  EKG with lasteral ST depressions and
   slightly elevated cardiac margers.
   - discuss aspirin with PCP but appears to be likely candidate
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient with worsening LE edema x 1 month and markedly
   elevanted BNP.  EKG also c/w heart failure w/ vascular congestion,
   cephalization, and kerly-B lines.  Patients weight reportedly up from
   dry weight by 6 pounds.
   - will diurese with IV lasix today with additional IV Lasix, monitor
   electrolytes in PM and goal diuresis negative 2L today
   - continue home lisinopril
   - TTE today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient was admitted to the CCU with concerning EKG.  EKGs 20
   min apart, show loss of P wave, with formation of a broadened QrS with
   LBBB and irregular rate.  Rhythm strip upon arrival to floor more
   consistent with AF with slow ventricular response.  Patient has a
   history of AF, and is on anticoagulation.  Do not feel need for
   temporary pacing wire at this time.  Patient without symptoms from
   bradycardia.
   - hold off on nodal blockade
   - EP consult to evaluate if patient requires PPM
   - continue home dose of coumadin
   .
   # LE wounds:  Likely from weeping LE edema.  No DVT on LENI.  Patient
   was given vanc in ED, but no evidence of infection (no fever,
   leukocytosis.)  Likely erythema from chronic venostasis.
   - diuresis as specificied abovie
   - wound care consult in am
   - Podiatry consult for wound care
   - continue Vancomycin for now given concerns of superimposed infection
   - percocet for pain control

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) x3, atrial fibrillation (AF) on coumadin, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presents with worsening lower extremity edema and is found to have an EKG concerning for critical conduction disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Coronary artery disease (CAD) with possible ongoing ischemia or myocardial infarction.
2. Worsening heart failure with signs of fluid overload, such as lower extremity edema and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).
3. Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, which may require rate control medication and consideration for anticoagulation therapy.
4. Bradycardia due to AV nodal blockade or intrinsic conduction system disease, necessitating careful monitoring and potential temporary pacing if symptomatic.
5. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to lower extremity edema and immobility. Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended.
6. Skin breakdown and potential wound infection in the presence of weeping lower extremity edema.
7. The need for ongoing cardiac monitoring and optimization of heart failure therapy, including diuretics and possibly adjustment of home medications like lisinopril.

   Imaging:
   TTE ([**12-25**]): Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular cavity
   enlargement with moderate global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Right ventricular cavity enlargement. Dilated ascending
   aorta.  EF of 35-40%
   Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of
   [**2182-2-8**], the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure are higher. The left ventricle is
   now larger with more depressed global systolic function.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 88 y/o male w/ a hx of MI s/p CABG x3, AF on coumadin, and
   CHF who presents with worsening lower extremity edema, found to have
   EKG concerning for critical conduction disease.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p MI with CABG.  No
   complaints of chest pain.  EKG with lateral ST depressions and slightly
   elevated cardiac markers on admission.
   - Will discuss starting ASA with his PCP.
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient with worsening LE edema x 1 month and markedly
   elevanted BNP.  EKG also c/w heart failure w/ vascular congestion,
   cephalization, and kerly-B lines on admission.  Patients weight
   reportedly up from dry weight by 6 pounds.   The patient is negative
   2.3 L for LOS.  Had been on 40 mg of lasix IV bid yesterday.  TTE
   showed an EF of 35-40% and moderate global hypokinesis consistent with
   a diffuse process.
   - Will change the IV lasix to 60 mg daily and aim for a goal of
   negative 500 cc today.
   - Continue home lisinopril
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient was admitted to the CCU with concerning EKG.  EKGs 20
   min apart, show loss of P wave, with formation of a broadened QrS with
   LBBB and irregular rate.  Rhythm strip upon arrival to floor more
   consistent with AF with slow ventricular response.  Patient has a
   history of AF, and is on anticoagulation.  Do not feel need for
   temporary pacing wire at this time.  The patient continues without
   symptoms from bradycardia.  EP evaluated the patient and offered a
   nonurgent pacemaker placement, however the patient does not wish to
   have a pacemaker placed.
   - Appreciate EP consult.
   - Will restart coumadin (which was held yesterday due to the
   possibility of pacemaker placement).
   - As the patient
s already bradycardic no need for nodal blockade for
   A.fib.
   .
   # LE wounds:  Likely from weeping LE edema.  No DVT on LENI.  Patient
   was given vanc in ED, but no evidence of infection (no fever,
   leukocytosis.)  Likely erythema from chronic venostasis.   Podiatry
   evaluated the patient yesterday and felt his changes were from chronic
   venous stasis and that there were no signs of infection; however they
   recommended continuing Vancomycin given his recent fevers.
   - Diuresis as specificied above
   - Appreciate wound care consult.
   - Appreciate podiatry consult.
   - Continue Vancomycin for now given concerns of superimposed infection
   given recent fevers.
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  The patient has been persistently hyponatremic (on
   admission was at 127), today is stable at 129.  Likely from total body
   fluid overload secondary to CHF causing hypoperfusion of his kidneys.
   IV diuresis with lasix may also be contributing.
   - Low sodium diet
   - Continue to follow.
