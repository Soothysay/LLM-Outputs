   Assessment and Plan
   Mr.  [**Known lastname 4584**] is a 75 year old male with severe COPD, prostate ca s/p
   lupron and brachytherapy, PAF, urinary retention who presents with
   respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD exacerbation..
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is known to have COPD.  His blood
   gasses show significant hypercarbia and there is wheezing on exam,
   making COPD exacerbation the most likely diagnosis.  Patient had
   significant improvement with nebs, steroids, antibiotics, lasix.  Got
   ceftaz/levaquin to cover severe CAP, however [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 4605**] ceftaz given
   lack of cough, fever, wbc or clinical suggestion of pneumonia.   He
   diuresed 1L with lasix, but appears euvolemic so will hold off on
   further diuresis.
   - albuterol, atrovent nebs
   - solumedrol 125 IV q 8 hours
 transition to prednisone tomorrow
   - levaquin, d/c ceftaz
   - BIPAP as needed for pH < 7.20 or pCO2> 90 or respiratory distress
   - titrate supplemental oxygen to keep sats 88-92%
   - f/u blood and sputum cultures
   - follow fever curve and WBC
   .
   2.  HTN.  Patient has HTN.  Was previously on metoprolol and diltiazem
   at unclear doses.  However, patient unclear as to what medications he
   currently takes and his pharmacy (CVS in [**Location (un) 1714**] (zip code [**Numeric Identifier 4587**]) is
   currently closed.
   - transition from iv lopressor to PO lopressor
   - follow BP, HR
   .
   3.  PAF.  Patient has a history of PAF.  Currently in NSR.  Not
   currently antocoagulated.
   - continue BB
   - continue monitor on tele
   - aspirin
   .
   4. Urinary retention.  Has history of prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy
   with history of subsequent urinary retention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe COPD, prostate cancer, PAF, and urinary retention. He presented with respiratory distress, likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation. The patient's blood gases show significant hypercarbia and there is wheezing on exam. There was significant improvement with nebs, steroids, antibiotics, and lasix. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD puts him at risk for respiratory failure. The improvement with nebs, steroids, antibiotics, and lasix suggests a COPD exacerbation as the most likely diagnosis. 
2. Hypertension (HTN): The patient has a history of HTN. His current blood pressure is 152/69 mmHg. It is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure in the ICU.
3. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (PAF and DVT): The patient has a history of PAF and should be monitored for any signs of pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the use of HSQ for DVT prophylaxis is noted.
4. Urinary retention: The patient has a history of prostate cancer and subsequent urinary retention. It is important to continue monitoring his urinary function and continue with flomax.
5. Infection: Although not explicitly mentioned in the assessment, the patient received antibiotics, suggesting a concern for infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr.  [**Known lastname 4584**] is a 75 year old male with severe COPD, prostate ca s/p
   lupron and brachytherapy, PAF, urinary retention who presents today
   with respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD exacerbation +/-
   CHF and pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is known to have COPD, s/p
   pneumothorax x 2 treated with pleuradesis.  No prior PFTs in our
   records.  His blood gasses show significant hypercarbia and there is
   wheezing on exam, making COPD exacerbation the most likely diagnosis.
   However, will cover for pneumonia with ceftaz/levaquin given patients
   cough and CXR.  Will diurese gently in case there is an element of CHF
   though this seems less likely given normal BNP.  Prior echo shows
   pulmonary hypertension with RV hypertrophy and dilitation.
   - albuterol, atrovent nebs
   - solumedrol 125 IV q 8 hours
   - levaquin/ceftaz
   - BIPAP as needed for pH < 7.20 or pCO2> 90 or respiratory distress
   - titrate supplemental oxygen to keep sats 88-92%
   - lasix IV 20 x 1 with goal negative 500 - 1 L negative tonight
   - repeat CXR in AM post diuresis
   - ROMI
   - f/u blood and sputum cultures
   - follow fever curve and WBC
   .
   2.  HTN.  Patient has HTN.  Was previously on metoprolol and diltiazem
   at unclear doses.  However, patient unclear as to what medications he
   currently takes and his pharmacy (CVS in [**Location (un) 1714**] (zip code [**Numeric Identifier 4587**]) is
   currently closed.
   - metoprolol IV 5 q 4 hours and titrate as needed for HR and BP
   control; will transition to orals when diet is advanced
   .
   3.  PAF.  Patient has a history of PAF.  Currently in NSR.  Not
   currently antocoagulated.
   - continue BB
   - continue monitor on tele
   - aspirin
   .
   4. Urinary retention.  Has history of prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy
   with history of subsequent urinary retention.
   - continue flomax
   .
   Prophylaxis: HSQ
   FEN: NPO for now pending improvement of respiratory status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe COPD, prostate cancer (s/p lupron and brachytherapy), peripheral artery disease (PAF), urinary retention, who presents with respiratory distress. The likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation possibly secondary to pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a history of pneumothorax treated with pleuradesis. Initial treatment includes nebulized albuterol and atrovent, IV solumedrol, levofloxacin/ceftazidime, BIPAP as needed, supplemental oxygen, IV lasix for fluid management, and ROMI. Other medical issues include hypertension, for which the patient was previously on metoprolol and diltiazem, but current medication doses are unclear. The patient's pharmacy is closed, so IV metoprolol is being started for BP and HR control. The patient also has a history of PAF and is not currently anticoagulated. Urinary retention is also present due to a history of prostate cancer treatment. The patient is NPO pending improvement of respiratory status. Code status is full code. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial line placement, and prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Mr.  [**Known lastname 4584**] is a 75 year old male with severe COPD, prostate ca s/p
   lupron and brachytherapy, PAF, urinary retention who presents with
   respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD exacerbation..
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is known to have COPD.  His blood
   gasses showed significant hypercarbia and he was initially wheezing on
   exam, making COPD exacerbation the most likely diagnosis.  Patient had
   significant improvement with nebs, steroids, antibiotics, lasix.  Got
   ceftaz/levaquin to cover severe CAP, however ceftaz stopped given lack
   of cough, fever, wbc or clinical suggestion of pneumonia.   He
   initially diuresed 1L with lasix, but appeared euvolemic so did not
   have significant further lasix.
   - change albuterol, atrovent nebs to home meds of
   Spiriva/Combivent/Duoneb
   - change solumedrol 125 IV q 8 hours  to Prednisone 40mg PO daily with
   likely taper over 7 days when d/c
   - Continue Levofloxacin PO now day [**3-23**],
   - BIPAP as needed for pH < 7.20 or pCO2> 90 or respiratory distress
   - titrate supplemental oxygen to keep sats 88-92%
   - f/u blood and sputum cultures
   .
   2.  HTN.  Patient has HTN.  Home cardiac meds appear to be diltiazem
   240mg [**Hospital1 7**] and no BB as well as cozar.  Meds doses taken from PCP by
   phone (from memory) which agreed with paperwork from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - change lopressor to Diltiazem 60mg QID (to reach
 home dose)
   - will hold off on Losartan until stable with Diltiazem (should be
   restarted on floor tomorrow)
   - follow BP, HR
   .
   3.  PAF.  Patient has a history of PAF.  Currently in NSR.  Not
   currently antocoagulated.
   - change lopressor to Dilt as above today
   - continue monitor on tele
   - aspirin
   .
   4. Urinary retention.  Has history of prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy
   with history of subsequent urinary retention.
   - continue flomax, unclear if on flomax at home

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU due to chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been transitioned from a facemask to a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. He is currently on prophylactic antibiotics and has received Levofloxacin and Ceftazidime. The patient is also receiving metoprolol and heparin sodium for cardiovascular support.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/58 mmHg to 148/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 170 mL and total output of 990 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 820 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and ABG results indicate a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 91 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 343.

Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessment, and other systems. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate levels. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes, and electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The patient is on prophylactic antibiotics, indicating a concern for potential infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic management is crucial.
3. Fluid imbalance: The negative fluid balance suggests ongoing losses, which could be due to diuretic use, gastrointestinal losses, or insensible losses. Monitoring fluid status and adjusting fluid administration accordingly is important.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The fluctuating blood pressure readings may indicate cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and adjustment of cardiovascular medications are necessary.
5. Potential bleeding risk: The use of heparin sodium for prophylaxis increases the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and ensuring proper monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential.
6. Medication side effects: The use of multiple medications, including metoprolol and heparin sodium, may result in side effects. Regular assessment for any adverse reactions to medications is necessary."
