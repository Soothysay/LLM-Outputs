   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   46 yo man with HCV/ETOH cirrhosis, admitted [**10-23**] after a fall at
   home.  Had C6/7, T1 transverse process fx, and also right frontal
   hemorrhage.  He had a course complicated by fevers, and was
   treated for a PNA, although cultures were negative.  He was ready for
   rehab this morning, but at 4:00 he got up from bed and fell face flat.
   CT with parafalcine SDH and enlarged right frontal hemorrhage.
   Followup CT 7 hours later showed hemorrhage continuing to enlarge.  INR
   was 3.1 and platelets were 42.  So transferred to ICU for further
   management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of HCV/ETOH cirrhosis, admitted to the hospital after falling at home. He had a previous injury with a C6/7, T1 transverse process fracture and a right frontal hemorrhage. The patient developed fevers and was treated for pneumonia, although cultures were negative. He was ready for rehabilitation but experienced a fall, leading to a parafalcine subdural hemorrhage and an enlarged right frontal hemorrhage. The patient's INR was 3.1, and platelets were 42, indicating a bleeding risk. He was transferred to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include an allergy to citalopram, shakiness, and respiratory issues. The patient received infusions and other ICU medications. There were no changes to his medical or family history.

Review of systems remains unchanged except for the recent complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/61 mmHg to 126/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia.

Physical examination shows no acute distress, with periorbital ecchymoses, blood around the lips and nose, and trace lower extremity edema."

   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  About to get
   another 6 units of FFP (for total of 8); already had 1 PRBC and 2 plts.
   - Q6H head CT until bleed stabilized (next due at 5 pm)
   - Q15 min neuro checks
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, f/u phenytoin levels; will
   have to change to IV dilantin
   - goal INR < 1.5, plt > 80, fibrinogen > 100, and SBP < 160
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission
   - follow INR, plt, fibrinogen, Ca, Hct and transfuse PRN as above
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - hemorrhage as above
   - would cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day) with Lactulose

   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin once NG placed or MS improves
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI once NG placed or MS improves
   - cont furosemide and spironolactone once NG placed or MS improves
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores

   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed

   # DISPO: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcohol use disorder (AUD). He presented with altered mental status, ascites, varices, and encephalopathy. The patient also has intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, and a parafalcine subdural hematoma. He has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for seizure prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but his laboratory results show abnormalities, such as elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies reveal a right frontal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect, as well as blood in the occipital horns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Head Bleed: The patient has a worsening intraparenchymal hemorrhage following a fall. There is evidence of expansion on repeat CT, and a new subdural hematoma has developed. The patient will likely require intervention once coagulopathy is corrected.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has hepatic dysfunction and mild disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Close monitoring of INR, platelets, fibrinogen, calcium levels, hematocrit, and transfusion as needed are necessary.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with ETOH cirrhosis who suffered a fall resulting in a right frontal hemorrhage. He received 8 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which improved his international normalized ratio (INR) to 1.5. The patient has a history of allergies to citalopram, shakiness, and respiratory problems. He is currently receiving various medications including mannitol, pantoprazole, pentoxyfilline, dilantin, lactulose, lidocaine, folate, and thiamine. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has trace lower extremity edema. His laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient is arousable and follows simple commands, indicating some level of neurological function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Bleeding: Despite the improvement in INR, the patient's coagulopathy needs to be closely monitored, as there is still a risk of bleeding complications.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of ETOH cirrhosis, there is a"

   2. Slight increase in size of temporal horns which may represent early
   signs of hydrocephalus. Close follow up is recommended.
   3. Stable right parafalcine subdural hematoma. No new areas of
   parenchymal hemorrhage.
   Assessment and Plan
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and
   encephalopathy; course complicated by intraparenchymal bleed,
   pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - Head CT repeats per Neuro recs
 one today and one tomorrow; f/u
   reads
   - Q1 hour neuro checks  continue
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, f/u phenytoin levels and
   adjust for albumin
   - goal INR < 1.5, plt > 80, fibrinogen > 100, and SBP < 160; check q6h
   coags, fibrinogen, and CBC to ensure meeting this goal
   - f/u neurosurgery recommendations
   - Mannitol with dosing changes based on q6hour Posm and Na.  Goal is
   Posm of 315 and Na 147.
   - Check Na in 3 hours, and then again at the 6 hour intervals with
   Posm, coags, fibrinogen, and CBC before each potential mannitol dose
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission
   - follow INR, plt, fibrinogen, Ca, Hct and transfuse PRN as above
   - q6hour Hct, PT, fibrinogen checks.
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <1.5; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - d/c furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD.
   - local wound care
   .
   # FEN: No IVF

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and a history of alcohol abuse. He presented with altered mental status, ascites, varices, and encephalopathy. The patient's course has been complicated by an intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, and encephalopathy. He fell recently, which resulted in an expansion of the intracranial hemorrhage and the development of a new subdural hematoma. 

The patient has received multiple units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and platelets. His INR is currently elevated at 19.9, his PT/PTT are also elevated, and his fibrinogen level is low. His blood glucose is low, and his calcium level is on the lower end of normal. His sodium level is within normal range, but his potassium and phosphorus levels are on the higher end. His white blood cell count is slightly elevated.

The patient has a CT head showing a stable right frontal lobe hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema, intraventricular extension of hemorrhage, and a slight increase in the size of the temporal horns which may indicate early signs of hydrocephalus. There is also a stable right parafalcine subdural hematoma.

   of vasogenic edema causing stable mild leftward shift of midline
   structures.  Apparent intraventricular extension of hemorrhage with
   increased amount of layering hemorrhage within the occipital horns
   bilaterally.
   2. Slight increase in size of temporal horns which may represent early
   signs of hydrocephalus. Close follow up is recommended.
   3. Stable right parafalcine subdural hematoma. No new areas of
   parenchymal hemorrhage.
   Assessment and Plan
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and
   encephalopathy; course complicated by intraparenchymal bleed,
   pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  About to get
   another 6 units of FFP (for total of 8); already had 1 PRBC and 2 plts.
   - Head CT repeats per Neuro recs
   - Q1 hour neuro checks
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, f/u phenytoin levels
   - goal INR < 1.5, plt > 80, fibrinogen > 100, and SBP < 160
   - call neurosurg re: plan for him once reverses
   - Mannitol with dosing changes based on q6hour [**Month/Day (4) 9662**] and Na.  Goal is
   [**Month/Day (4) 9662**] of 315 and Na 147
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission
   - follow INR, plt, fibrinogen, Ca, Hct and transfuse PRN as above
   - q 6hour Hct, PT, [**Name (NI) 9662**], and Na check.
   - Goal INR <1.5; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; pRBC PRN
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - hemorrhage as above
   - would cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day) with Lactulose
   enema [**Hospital1 **] though pt has no NG tube now; need to place an NG tube or
   Dobhoff
   - continue above management of head bleed
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin once NG placed or MS improves
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI once NG placed or MS improves
   - cont furosemide and spironolactone once NG placed or MS improves
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD.
   - local wound care
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO for now

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has presented with multiple medical complications. The patient's current condition includes a subdural hematoma (SDH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage, pneumonia, and encephalopathy. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/71 mmHg to 131/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT), administration of fluids, blood products, and medications such as pantoprazole (Protonix) and phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in liver function tests, coagulation profile, and electrolyte levels. The CT scan of the head reveals stable size of right frontal lobe hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema, intraventricular extension of hemorrhage, and a slight increase in size of temporal horns which may represent early signs of hydrocephalus. 

The patient's MELD score is currently 31, indicating severe liver dysfunction. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further expansion of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage or SDH, development of hepatic enceph"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old individual with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease), ascites, varices, and encephalopathy. They were admitted after experiencing a fall that resulted in an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and midline shift. The patient has a history of allergies to citalopram, causing shakiness and respiratory issues. They have been receiving various treatments, including a PICC line, NG tube, and infusions of FFP (fresh frozen plasma), Mannitol, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/61 mmHg to 155/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight remains relatively unchanged since admission.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,426 mL, including 1,898 mL of PO (oral intake), 2,860 mL of IV fluids, and 1,566 mL of blood products. The total output was 4,375 mL, consisting of 2,450 mL of urine, -552 mL of NG drainage, and other drains. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 96% and ABG results indicating [insert ABG values].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), ascites, varices, and encephalopathy who was admitted after experiencing an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) complicated by midline shift. The patient has been placed on a mannitol drip to manage the subdural hemorrhage (SDH) and has received blood products for coagulopathy. ESLD management includes the placement of a dobbhoff tube for lactulose administration and continued use of lasix/aldactone. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and SDH.
2. Possible worsening of liver function and complications related to ESLD.
3. Risk of infection due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines.
4. Potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization.
6. Need for close monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances and fluid balance."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease, ascites, varices, and encephalopathy. He was admitted after falling and sustaining an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) complicated by midline shift. The patient has been receiving various treatments including a PICC line, NG tube, and infusions of FFP and mannitol. He has a history of allergies to citalopram and experiences shakiness. His last dose of antibiotics was ampicillin/sulbactam, and he is currently on pantoprazole and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. He is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 81.3 kg, and his fluid balance shows a positive balance of 51 mL. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows a stable size of hemorrhage with midline shift, increased bleeding in the occipital horns. The patient is currently being treated for subdural hemorrhage, coagulopathy, and end-stage liver disease. He is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include worsening of coagulopathy leading to further bleeding, development of infections due to prolonged hospitalization and use of"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and
   encephalopathy; course complicated by intraparenchymal bleed,
   pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - Head CT repeats per Neuro recs
 one today and one tomorrow; f/u
   final reads
   - Q2 hour neuro checks continue (change from q1h to q2h)
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, dosing was corrected
   yesterday for albumin and it was correct phenytoin dose
   - goal INR < 2.0, plt > 80, fibrinogen > 100, and SBP < 160; check q6h
   coags, fibrinogen, and CBC to ensure meeting this goal
 confirm these
   goals with neurosurgery.
   - f/u neurosurgery recommendations on management
   - Mannitol with dosing changes based on q6hour Posm and Na.  Goal is
   Posm of 315 and Na 150
 confirm this with neurosurgery.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory fatigue,
   tachypnea, SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. Believed due to volume
   overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration. Diuresing well now.
   Tolerating vent well now, with good ABG
   - Diuresis with lasix (40mg IV now); goal: negative 1-2 L today
   - CXR tomorrow
   - Check ABG now
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission
   - q6hour Hct, coag, fibrinogen checks.
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <1.5; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   - hold sedation as tolerated while intubated
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - holding standing furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD.
   - local wound care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and a history of alcohol use disorder. He presented with respiratory distress, tachypnea, and hypoxia, leading to intubation on 11/13 due to fatigue, tachypnea, and SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. The initial assessment was uncertain about the cause of respiratory distress, considering volume overload/CHF, TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury), or aspiration. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by an intraparenchymal bleed, which worsened following a fall with evidence of expansion on repeat CT. There is also a new subdural hematoma. The patient has received multiple units of FFP (fresh frozen plasma), PRBC (packed red blood cells), and platelets.

The plan includes repeat head CTs per neuro recommendations, q2h neuro checks, phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, goal INR <2.0, platelets >80, fibrinogen >100, and SBP <160. Coagulation status will be monitored q6h with CBC, coagulation tests, and fibrinogen checks. Mannitol dosing will be adjusted based on q6-hour osmolarity (Posm) and sodium (Na) levels, aiming for Posm of 315 and Na 150.

   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - Head CT repeats per Neuro recs
 one today and one tomorrow; f/u
   reads
   - Q1 hour neuro checks  continue
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, f/u phenytoin levels and
   adjust for albumin
   - goal INR < 1.5, plt > 80, fibrinogen > 100, and SBP < 160; check q6h
   coags, fibrinogen, and CBC to ensure meeting this goal
   - f/u neurosurgery recommendations
   - Mannitol with dosing changes based on q6hour Posm and Na.  Goal is
   Posm of 315 and Na 147.
   - Check Na in 3 hours, and then again at the 6 hour intervals with
   Posm, coags, fibrinogen, and CBC before each potential mannitol dose
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory fatigue,
   tachypnea, SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. Believed due to volume
   overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration.
   - Diuresis with lasix; goal:
   - CXR tomorrow
   -
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission
   - follow INR, plt, fibrinogen, Ca, Hct and transfuse PRN as above
   - q6hour Hct, PT, fibrinogen checks.
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <1.5; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - d/c furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD.

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) presenting with acute respiratory failure, subdural hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal bleed. The patient's history of liver disease-related coagulopathy may have contributed to the intracranial hemorrhage, which has worsened following a fall. There is evidence of expansion on repeat CT scan, along with new SDH (subdural hematoma). Intervention is likely needed once coagulopathy is corrected. The patient has received multiple units of FFP (fresh frozen plasma), PRBC (packed red blood cells), and platelets.

The patient's respiratory distress required intubation on [**11-13**] due to fatigue, tachypnea, and SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. The cause of respiratory distress is believed to be volume overload/CHF (congestive heart failure) versus TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) versus aspiration.

Coagulopathy management includes follow-up INR (international normalized ratio), platelet count, fibrinogen level, calcium level, hematocrit, and transfusion as needed. Goal fibrinogen >100, replete with cryoprecipitate as needed. Goal INR <1.5, replete with FFP as needed. Goal Hct 25, replete with PRBC as needed.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU. They have been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, which may be caused by aspiration leading to flash pulmonary edema or other etiologies. The patient also has a subdural hemorrhage (SDH), coagulopathy, end-stage liver disease (ESLD) likely due to alcohol use, altered mental status, a transverse process fracture, and a guarded prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure and is on invasive ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which could lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient has a SDH, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications if not managed properly.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile shows abnormalities, indicating an increased risk of bleeding or clotting disorders. This needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
4. End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD): The patient has ESLD, likely secondary to chronic alcohol use. This condition carries a poor prognosis and may contribute to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is arousable but has altered mental"

   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - Head CT repeats per Neuro recs
 one today and one tomorrow; f/u
   final reads
   - Q2 hour neuro checks continue (change from q1h to q2h)
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, dosing was corrected
   yesterday for albumin and it was correct phenytoin dose
   - goal INR < 2.0, plt > 80, fibrinogen > 100, and SBP < 160; check q6h
   coags, fibrinogen, and CBC to ensure meeting this goal

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted with respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, and a subdural hemorrhage. The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder and falls, resulting in an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His condition is complicated by aspiration pneumonia, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, and volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including fever and leukocytosis. Pneumonia is suspected due to aspiration. There is also a concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) given the presence of ascites.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of falls and intracranial hemorrhage. His coagulopathy needs to be corrected to prevent further bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to volume overload, aspiration pneumonia, or other factors. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of ESLD and hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin should be continued to manage this condition.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient is diuresing well, but careful monitoring of fluid balance is required to prevent electrolyte im"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of intracranial hemorrhage and respiratory failure. They have been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and subdural hemorrhage. The patient is sedated and encephalopathic, unable to provide their medical history. They have allergies to citalopram and shakiness. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and piperacillin/tazobactam. They are receiving fluids, vasopressors, and respiratory support via mechanical ventilation. Neurosurgical intervention is planned for the intracranial hemorrhage. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including ESLD, coagulopathy, and a transverse process fracture. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to fever spikes, indicating a possible infection. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or side effects from the medications.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a subdural hemorrhage, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications. Coagulopathy and ESLD further increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old man with cirrhosis who is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) and is experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include intracranial hemorrhage and respiratory failure. 

The patient's fever has been managed by broadening antibiotics to include vancomycin and Zosyn overnight. The cultures from the pancreas and stool were obtained at different times. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, stable heart rate, slightly elevated blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation level is within normal limits.

The patient is unable to provide his own medical history due to sedation and encephalopathy. Allergies include citalopram and shakiness. The patient has been receiving various medications such as furosemide, midazolam, and fentanyl, as per the ICU team's recommendations.

The review of systems indicates constitutional symptoms including fever, respiratory symptoms related to mechanical ventilation, and no reported pain. The patient's flow sheet data includes hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and medication infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values in several areas, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, magnesium, chloride, glucose, liver enzymes, and coagulation parameters. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory alkalosis with compensated metabolic acidosis.

   Assessment and Plan
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and
   encephalopathy; course complicated by intraparenchymal bleed,
   pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - f/u head CT ordered this morning by neurosurgery
   - Q2 hour neuro checks continue
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, order level for tomorrow and
   then correct it for albumin level
   - Goals for INR, fibrinogen, Hct, plt, see N/S note and hepatology
   note; goal
 keep Hct >25, plt >80, INR >2.0, fibrinogen > 100, and SBP
   < 160; no longer need to check q6h labs however, given stability, and
   fall was days ago now
   - f/u neurosurgery recommendations on management and goals
   - hold mannitol; hold Posm and Na checks
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory fatigue,
   tachypnea, SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. Believed due to volume
   overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration. Tolerating vent well now,
   with solid ABG
   - Diuresis with lasix (80mg IV now) and spironolactone (200mg PO now);
   goal: negative -2 L today
   - Check ABG now
   - Wean PEEP from 10 to 8 as tolerated
   # Fevers:  Most likely aspiration, given aspiration and subsequent
   development of fevers.  Given one dose Unasyn, then Vancomycin x1
   dose.  However, also r/o SBP with US looking for ascites, per Liver
   recs.
   - Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration pneumonia, given patient
   aspiration and subsequent fevers
   - Abdominal US to r/o ascites, per Liver, f/u
   - f/u hepatology recs
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission
   - hold q6hour Hct, coag, fibrinogen checks, depending on CT head read,
   might increase or decrease frequency of lab checks
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <2; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal platelets >80; replete with platelets as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   - hold sedation as tolerated while intubated
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - holding standing furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD. Swabbed on [**11-15**].

 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and
   encephalopathy; course complicated by intraparenchymal bleed,
   pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - Head CT repeats per Neuro recs
 one today and one tomorrow; f/u
   final reads
   - Q2 hour neuro checks continue (change from q1h to q2h)
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, dosing was corrected
   yesterday for albumin and it was correct phenytoin dose
   - goal INR < 2.0, plt > 80, fibrinogen > 100, and SBP < 160; check q6h
   coags, fibrinogen, and CBC to ensure meeting this goal
 confirm these
   goals with neurosurgery.
   - f/u neurosurgery recommendations on management and discuss endpoint,
   need for qd CT head
   - Mannitol with dosing changes based on q6hour Posm and Na.  Goal is
   Posm of 315 and Na 150
 confirm this with neurosurgery.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory fatigue,
   tachypnea, SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. Believed due to volume
   overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration. Diuresing well now.
   Tolerating vent well now, with good ABG
   - Diuresis with lasix (40mg IV now); goal: negative 1-2 L today
   - Check ABG now
   # Fevers:  Most likely aspiration, given aspiration and subsequent
   development of fevers.  Given one dose Unasyn, then Vancomycin x1
   dose.  However, also r/o SBP with US looking for ascites, per Liver
   recs.
   - Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration pneumonia, given patient
   aspiration and subsequent fevers
   - Abdominal US to r/o ascites, per Liver
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission
   - q6hour Hct, coag, fibrinogen checks.
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <2; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal platelets >80; replete with platelets as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   - hold sedation as tolerated while intubated
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - holding standing furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD. Swabbed on [**11-15**].

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) presenting with fever, altered mental status, respiratory distress, and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's condition is complicated by aspiration pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy, intraparenchymal bleed, and subdural hemorrhage.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Head Bleeds: The patient has evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage that worsened following a fall. There is also a new subdural hemorrhage. Intervention will likely be needed once coagulopathy is corrected. Repeat head CTs are recommended per neurosurgery's recommendations.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient was intubated on [11-13] due to respiratory fatigue, tachypnea, and SpO2 in the high 80s on 100% face mask. This is believed to be due to volume overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration. Diuresis with lasix is ongoing, and the goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1-2 L today. ABG checks should be done now.
3. Fevers: The most likely cause of the fevers is aspiration pneumonia. Unasyn and vancomycin have been administered. A US is needed to rule out ascites, per liver recommendations.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has hepatic dysfunction and mild disseminated intrav"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis who is currently in the MICU with acute respiratory failure and an intracranial hemorrhage. He is sedated and encephalopathic, unable to provide any history. The patient has been febrile since the previous night, with a fever of 102.9°F at 08:00 PM. He has been receiving antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a dorsal eschar on his right great toe, which is leaking serum material. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 127/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His fluid balance is positive, with a total input of 3,497 mL and a total output of 1,676 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) could arise if proper precautions are not taken.
2. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has a subdural hemorrhage, which requires neurosurgical intervention. Potential complications include worsening of the"

 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and
   encephalopathy; course complicated by intraparenchymal bleed,
   pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - f/u final read of yesterday
s head CT (was stable on wet read)
   - Change from Q2 to Q4 hour neuro checks
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, f/u AM level and adjust for
   albumin
   - Given stable CT scan of head, will check with hepatology If ok to
   stop frequently checking and repleting coags, CBC, fibrinogen. Will not
   transfuse this morning with blood products given stability, and unclear
   goal/endpoint. F/u with both neurosurgery and hepatology.
   Previously:
   keep Hct >25
   plt >80
   INR <2.0
   fibrinogen > 100
   SBP < 160
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - hold mannitol; hold Posm & Na checks
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory fatigue,
   tachypnea, SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. Believed due to volume
   overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration. Tolerating vent well now,
   with good ABG
   - Continue antibiotics for potential aspiration, with vanc/zosyn
   - Give 80 lasix and 100 spironolactone this morning; goal -500cc, to
   prime for potential extubation
   - Wean down pressure support even more, then SBT this morning; pending
   results and ability to wean, consider extubation attempt later today
   # Fevers:  Most likely aspiration, given aspiration and subsequent
   development of fevers.  Given one dose Unasyn, then Vancomycin x1
   dose.  However, also r/o SBP with US looking for ascites, per Liver
   recs
 ultrasound negative for ascites.
   - Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration pneumonia, given patient
   aspiration and subsequent fevers
   - Trend fever curve
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission.
   - Hold on daily fibrinogen checks, not repleting coags and fibrinogen
   for now; will follow-up this issue with hepatology today.
   Previously: Daily Hct, plt, coag, fibrinogen checks:
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <2; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal platelets >80; replete with platelets as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day) [he is having BM
   - hold sedation as tolerated while intubated
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - hold standing furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD. Swabbed on [**11-15**].

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to alcohol abuse. He was readmitted to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) after falling and sustaining a new head bleed, as well as hallux ulceration. The patient has multiple medical complications including fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, subdural hemorrhage, altered mental status, and chronic liver disease.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been experiencing a fever of 101.9°F, which is of unknown origin.
- He was intubated on [11-13] due to respiratory fatigue, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation on 100% face mask. The cause of his respiratory distress is unclear, but it may be related to volume overload/CHF, TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury), or aspiration.
- The patient's coagulopathy has improved, but he still requires close monitoring of his coagulation parameters.
- He has developed a shallow toe ulcer, which is likely related to peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
- The patient's liver disease has led to hepatic encephalopathy and intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
- His MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score is 31, indicating severe liver dysfunction.
- The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, chronic ductal dilation, and esophageal varices.

   Dorsal ulceration is shallow and fibrotic in nature.  No drainage
   able to be expressed under pressure.  There is no erythema
   peri-wound, but there is proximal streaking along the medial
   arch.  There is no fluctulance to indicate an underlying abscess.
   His pulses are not palpable likely secondary to +2 pitting edema,
   but he has biphasic dopplar on exam.  While there is mild
   cellulitis, the antibiotics that he is on should adequately cover
   his infection.

   pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - f/u final read of yesterday
s head CT (was stable on wet read)
   - Q2 hour neuro checks continue
 ask if could change to q4h
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, f/u AM level and adjust for
   albumin
   - Given stable CT scan, check daily coags, Hct, plts, fibrinogen and
   replete for:
   keep Hct >25
   plt >80
   INR <2.0
   fibrinogen > 100
   SBP < 160
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - hold mannitol; hold Posm & Na checks
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory fatigue,
   tachypnea, SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. Believed due to volume
   overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration. Tolerating vent well now,
   with good ABG
   - Continue antibiotics for potential aspiration, with vanc/zosyn
   - SBT this morning; pending results and ability to wean, consider
   extubation attempt
   # Fevers:  Most likely aspiration, given aspiration and subsequent
   development of fevers.  Given one dose Unasyn, then Vancomycin x1
   dose.  However, also r/o SBP with US looking for ascites, per Liver
   recs
 ultrasound negative for ascites.
   - Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration pneumonia, given patient
   aspiration and subsequent fevers
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission.
   - Daily Hct, plt, coag, fibrinogen checks, as above
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <2; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal platelets >80; replete with platelets as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   - hold sedation as tolerated while intubated
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - hold standing furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD. Swabbed on [**11-15**].

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcohol use. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after a fall resulting in a new head bleed. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including cirrhosis of the liver, fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure, and subdural hemorrhage.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an inflammatory response. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures have been obtained.

The patient's recent imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusion but no ascites. A head CT scan shows a stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage with evidence of expansion following a fall, as well as a new subdural hemorrhage. There are no signs of intraventricular extension or other significant abnormalities.

The patient's past medical history includes ethanol abuse, chronic liver disease, and previous episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. He has a history"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis who is currently in the MICU with an intracranial hemorrhage. He also has acute respiratory failure and ongoing fevers. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 172/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. The blood culture results are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals facial ecchymoses, right lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Neurological assessment is not possible due to the patient's unresponsive state.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his intracranial hemorrhage, acute respiratory failure, and fevers. The medical team is considering extubation based on the results of a spontaneous breathing trial, and they are continuing with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening intracranial hemorrhage, pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and hepatic encephalopathy."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be due to the underlying cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholic hepatitis. This can lead to difficulty in breathing and inadequate oxygenation.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing a persistent fever, indicating an underlying infection or inflammatory condition. Further investigation is required to determine the source of the fever.

3. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient has a subdural hemorrhage, which is a type of bleeding that occurs between the covering of the brain (dura) and the surface of the brain. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management.

4. Infection: The presence of Enterobacter cloacae in the respiratory culture suggests a possible hospital-acquired infection. It is important to ensure proper antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.

5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms. Monitoring for these symptoms is crucial.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and underlying liver disease increase the risk of developing blood"

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and encephalopathy; course
   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.  Head CTs have shown
   increased bleed but stable midline shift, neurosurgery is deferring
   surgical intervention if no increase of midline shift.  Given stable CT
   scan of head, will stop frequently checking and repleting coags, CBC,
   fibrinogen, will also stop frequent Posm and Na checks and hold
   mannitol.
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - Cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, f/u AM level and adjust for
   albumin
   - Q4 hour neuro checks
   - F/u with both neurosurgery and hepatology.
   .
   Previously:
   keep Hct >25
   plt >80
   INR <2.0
   fibrinogen > 100
   SBP < 160
   # Fevers:  Most likely aspiration, given aspiration and subsequent
   development of fevers.  Given one dose Unasyn, then Vancomycin x1
   dose.  However, also r/o SBP with US looking for ascites, per Liver
   recs
 ultrasound negative for ascites.  Sputum culture growing
   Enterobacter Cloacae which is pan-sensitive.
   - Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration pneumonia for 7 day course, given
   patient
s aspiration and subsequent fevers, then will re-assess at that
   time for need for continued course
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day) [he is having BM
   - hold sedation as tolerated while intubated
   .
   Less active/resolved problems:

   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD. Swabbed on [**11-15**].
   - Podiatry signed off
   - f/u swab micro/culture; showing coag negative staph
   - f/u read of foot x-ray
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission.  Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.
   - Hold on daily fibrinogen checks, not repleting coags and fibrinogen
   for now; will follow-up this issue with hepatology today.
   Previously: Daily Hct, plt, coag, fibrinogen checks:
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <2; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal platelets >80; replete with platelets as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - hold standing furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory fatigue,
   tachypnea, SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. Believed due to volume
   overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration. Tolerating vent well now,
   with good ABG
s.  Given 80 lasix and 100 spironolactone this morning;
   goal -500cc, to prime for potential extubation.  Extubated [**11-17**] with
   stable respiratory status.
   - Continue antibiotics for potential aspiration, with vanc/zosyn
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal

   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and multiple comorbidities. The patient was admitted with respiratory failure, subdural hemorrhage (SDH), and fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Extubated successfully with stable respiratory status after receiving lasix and spironolactone.
2. Fever controlled with antibiotics.
3. No signs of current infection in shallow toe ulcer.
4. Coagulopathy has improved with the administration of FFP, PRBC, and platelets.
5. Neurological status is stable with controlled intracranial bleeding.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin.
7. No evidence of ascites on ultrasound.
8. Blood cultures show sensitivity to multiple antibiotics.
9. The patient's MELD score is 31.
10. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are ongoing concerns regarding potential medical complications such as infection, bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to ESLD increases the risk of infections. Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for developing further infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and SDH indicate"

   Assessment and Plan
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and encephalopathy; course
   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: In setting of liver disease-related
   coagulopathy.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage worse now following fall
   with evidence of expansion on repeat CT.  Also with new SDH.  Will
   likely need intervention once coagulopathy corrected.  Has received
   already multiple units of FFP, PRBC and plts.
   - f/u final read of yesterday
s head CT (was stable on wet read)
   - Change from Q2 to Q4 hour neuro checks
   - cont phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, f/u AM level and adjust for
   albumin
   - Given stable CT scan of head, will check with hepatology If ok to
   stop frequently checking and repleting coags, CBC, fibrinogen. Will not
   transfuse this morning with blood products given stability, and unclear
   goal/endpoint. F/u with both neurosurgery and hepatology.
   Previously:
   keep Hct >25
   plt >80
   INR <2.0
   fibrinogen > 100
   SBP < 160
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - hold mannitol; hold Posm & Na checks
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Intubated on [**11-13**] due to respiratory fatigue,
   tachypnea, SpO2 in high 80s on 100% face mask. Believed due to volume
   overload/CHF versus TRALI versus aspiration. Tolerating vent well now,
   with good ABG
   - Continue antibiotics for potential aspiration, with vanc/zosyn
   - Give 80 lasix and 100 spironolactone this morning; goal -500cc, to
   prime for potential extubation
   - Wean down pressure support even more, then SBT this morning; pending
   results and ability to wean, consider extubation attempt later today
   # Fevers:  Most likely aspiration, given aspiration and subsequent
   development of fevers.  Given one dose Unasyn, then Vancomycin x1
   dose.  However, also r/o SBP with US looking for ascites, per Liver
   recs
 ultrasound negative for ascites.
   - Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration pneumonia, given patient
   aspiration and subsequent fevers
   - Trend fever curve
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission.
   - Hold on daily fibrinogen checks, not repleting coags and fibrinogen
   for now; will follow-up this issue with hepatology today.
   Previously: Daily Hct, plt, coag, fibrinogen checks:
   - Goal fibrinogen >100; replete with cryoprecipitate as needed
   - Goal INR <2; replete with FFP as needed
   - Goal platelets >80; replete with platelets as needed
   - Goal Hct 25; replete with pRBC as needed
   .
   #. Altered mental status: secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and
   hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has known decompensated liver
   disease with a previous history of encephalopathy.
   - intracranial hemorrhage management as above
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day) [he is having BM
   - hold sedation as tolerated while intubated
   .
   #. EtOH History: out of window for withdrawal
   .
   #. ESLD: no viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 31.  In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - hold standing furosemide and spironolactone
   - MRCP to evaluate biliary tree in future
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative. Does
   not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   .
   #. Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection. Likely related to
   known PVD. Swabbed on [**11-15**].
   - f/u podiatry recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old man with cirrhosis in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) who has experienced an intracranial hemorrhage. The patient was on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated yesterday and is doing well. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for aspiration pneumonia and ongoing fevers. The patient's head CT scan shows a stable intracranial hemorrhage from two days ago, and the healthcare team is monitoring his INR (International Normalized Ratio) and platelet levels.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is not related to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). He has cirrhosis of the liver, fever of unknown origin (FUO), and subdural hemorrhage (SDH).

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure of 134/57 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a face tent and is on CPAP/PSV (continuous positive airway pressure/spontaneous/timed) ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 455 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and an FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 100%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 80, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 115 and 136 mg/dL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, decreased platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine (Cr) levels, and abnormal liver function test results with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos).

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, and recent hospitalizations. The patient is currently taking lactulose and rifaximin for esophageal varices, which are a complication of cirrhosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), infection due to immunosuppression, hepatic encephalopathy, and further bleeding or deterioration in the intracranial hemorrhage. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, liver function, coagulation parameters, and neurological status."
