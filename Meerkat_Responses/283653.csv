   PLAN
   # Bradycardia: Transferred from the floor with hypotensive
   bradycardia.  She has had similar episodes here, worse during periods
   around sleep and responsive to atropine.  Has had myoclonic jerks
   suggestive of cerebral hypoperfusion.  Family was initally hesititant
   to place a placemaker, but now wishes to have one placed.    Most
   likely etiology is sick sinus or sinus exit block as no unconducted p
   waves observed during bradycardia.
   - EP consult early for placement.  Will need DNR/DNI status temporarily
   reversed & consent from HCP (brother).
   - Continue atropine for HR at 60, pacer pads placed.
   - Dopamine or isoproteronol if needed for chronotrophic support.
   - hold metoprolol indefinitely.
   .
   # Low Urine output:  Appears dry.  Contraction alkalosis responds to
   IVF.  Orthostasis may have contributed to falls.
   - NS bolus, IVF.

   # Fall: likely that sinus pauses/bradycardia were the etiology, but
   unknown as patient has not had then thus far while awake.  Echo shoed
   mild AS, but not likely to be causitive.  No focal neuro deficits.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital after a fall and transferred to the CCU with bradycardia. She has had multiple episodes of bradycardia, some of which resulted in loss of consciousness and respiratory arrest. These episodes were responsive to atropine, suggesting a sick sinus or sinus exit block. The family has decided to proceed with pacemaker placement. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm (with previous episodes of bradycardia), blood pressure of 162/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is not oriented and exhibits myoclonus.

The patient has a laceration on her head, distal pulses that are 2+, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. Laboratory results indicate an elevated TSH level with normal T3 and T4 levels, suggesting a sick euthyroid state. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 32.1, and HCO3- of 20.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

   .
   PLAN:
   # Bradycardia: while deemed symptomatic, unclear if she has had
   episodes while she was awake that cause her to pass out. Thus far on
   monitoring, all have been during sleep or in the peri-sleep period.
   During observation thus far in the CCU she had periods of myoclonic
   jerks while falling asleep. In discussion with cards fellow, these were
   of smaller magnitude than the events observed on the floor. Of note -
   her family was made aware of the events by the cardiololgy fellow. Code
   status was confirmed (DNR/DNI, no pacer or temp wire). Of note, the
   situation was discussed as possibly grave by the cardioolgoy fellow,
   and her son is boarding a plane this morning to [**Location (un) 168**].  Currently, the
   differential for her bradycardia would include: sinus arrest or pauses
   vs. Sino-atrial exit block. Seems consistent with sinus arrest and
   pauses rather than SA node exit block. Metoprolol could have
   exacerbated this.
   - no evidence of A-V dissociation
   - Her intrinsic escape rhythym may have been supressed in setting of
   sleep, which could be why she did not have an escape rhythym.
   - She was transfered to the CCU for possible chronotropic support with
   dopamine or isoproteronol. She has thus far not required this.
   - r/o MI, but would likely not have cath. Findings could be consistent
   with IMI but no ST-T-wave changes or chest pain to be suggestive of
   this.
   -hold metoprolol indefinitely.
   - woudl monitor overnight prior to d/w EP, especially given that
   metoprolol was discontinued and could have been contributant.
   .
   # Elevated TSH: T3/T4 pending
   - treat with levothyroxine if T3/T4 low
   .
   # Fall: possibel that sinus pauses/bradycardia were the etiology, but
   unknown as patient has not had then thus far while awake.
   - continue tele monitoring
   - consider echo to eval for AS (has murmur on exam) but given that
   family is not likely to persue aggresive measures may not need to eval
   gradient/valve area with cath.
   - consider transfer to medicine for further workup once bradycardia
   characterized and plan in place

   # Hypertension; hold metoprolol
   .
   # Depression: continue fluoxetine

   # Hyperlipidemia; continue statin

   # CODE: DNR/DNI

   # DISPO: unclear at this point. Family does not want pacemaker. Rest of
   fall work up for easily reversibel causese could be completed, even
   including echo +/- valvuloplasty if this is what coudl have caused her
   syncope. I am note yet ready to characterize her bradycardic events on
   telemetry as symptomatic bradycardia as they were at night during
   sleep. This of course may change if the CCU team witnesses an event.
   Of note, she had 2 separate bradycardic episodes on transfer to CCU
   during sleep that were asymptomatic, lasting a few seconds,
   hemodynamically stable with BP 140 systolic, and not associated with
   the marked symptoms descrbied above. She was arousable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall. She was transferred to the CCU due to bradycardia and has since been observed to have multiple episodes of severe bradycardia with loss of consciousness, brief respiratory arrest with stable O2 saturation, clonus with arousal, and multiple pauses lasting for 7-8 seconds. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 85 bpm (46-94 bpm), blood pressure of 162/67 mmHg (90-162/37-113 mmHg), respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (17-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

Her physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with a 2/6 systolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border. She has bilateral lower extremity edema, radial and dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ symmetric, and no known drug allergies. 

Laboratory results show a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and glucose level of 151 mg/dL. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following: 
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia episodes may be symptomatic, particularly during sleep or peri-sleep periods. The differential diagnosis includes sinus arrest"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall. She was initially transferred to the CCU due to bradycardia. The patient underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) yesterday and had her device interrogated today. Her blood pressure has been consistently high, exceeding 150 mmHg. The patient's urine output has improved since being on IV fluids. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are elevated, but her T3 and T4 levels are normal, indicating a likely sick euthyroid syndrome. The patient's fall may have been caused by sinus pauses or bradycardia, but this has not been confirmed as she has not experienced them while awake. An echocardiogram revealed mild aortic stenosis, but it is unlikely to be the cause of the fall. The patient does not have any focal neurological deficits. The patient's current medications include aspirin, calcium carbonate, atropine, heparin sodium, dopamine, lactulose, fluoxetine, simvastatin, Percocet, and warfarin. Her allergies are listed as no known drug allergies. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient initially presented with bradycardia, which required the placement of a permanent pacemaker. It is important to monitor her heart rhythm and ensure that the"

   likely etiology is sick sinus or sinus exit block as no unconducted p
   waves observed during bradycardia.
   - EP consult early for placement.  Will need DNR/DNI status temporarily
   reversed & consent from HCP (brother).
   - Continue atropine for HR at 60, pacer pads placed.
   - Dopamine or isoproteronol if needed for chronotrophic support.
   - hold metoprolol indefinitely.

   # Low Urine output:  Appears dry.  Contraction alkalosis responds to
   IVF.  Orthostasis may have contributed to falls.
   - NS bolus, IVF.
   .
   # Elevated TSH: T3/T4 normal.  Likely sick euthyroid.
   .
   # Fall: likely that sinus pauses/bradycardia were the etiology, but
   unknown as patient has not had then thus far while awake.  Echo shoed
   mild AS, but not likely to be causitive.  No focal neuro deficits.
   - PT consult
   - consider transfer to medicine for further workup once bradycardia
   characterized and plan in place

   # Hypertension; hold metoprolol

   # Depression: continue fluoxetine

   # Hyperlipidemia; continue statin

   # CODE: DNR/DNI but ok for atropine and transcutaneous pacing.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the hospital after a fall. She was transferred to the ICU due to bradycardia and has experienced similar episodes during sleep, which are responsive to atropine. The patient also has myoclonic jerks suggestive of cerebral hypoperfusion. The family initially hesitated but now wishes to have a pacemaker placed. The most likely etiology is sick sinus or sinus exit block, as no unconducted p waves were observed during bradycardia. An EP consult has been requested for pacemaker placement, with temporary reversal of DNR/DNI status and consent from the healthcare proxy (brother). Atropine will be continued for HR at 60, and pacer pads have been placed. Dopamine or isoproterenol may be used for chronotrophic support. Metoprolol will be held indefinitely.

The patient also has low urine output, appearing dry, with contraction alkalosis responding to IVF. Orthostasis may have contributed to the falls. A NS bolus and IVF will be administered. The patient's elevated TSH levels are likely due to a sick euthyroid state. The fall is suspected to be caused by sinus pauses/bradycardia, but further workup is needed. An Echo showed mild AS, but it is not likely to be causative. No focal neuro deficits were observed. A PT consult has been"
