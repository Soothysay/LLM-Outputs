","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, aggressive papillary thyroid cancer, and remote tobacco abuse. She presents with progressive shortness of breath over the past month, worse over the last three days. She was found to have a new left hilar mass and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 109/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is ill appearing and able to speak in short sentences. Physical examination findings include diminished air movement on the left side, egophony at the left base, no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi, and soft abdomen with no tenderness or bowel sounds. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated glucose level, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, and abnormal differential. Imaging shows a 4.6cm left hilar mass with multiple hypodensities in the liver, raising concerns for metastatic disease or new lung primary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia due to the left hilar mass. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection if not properly treated.
2. Empyema: Given the presence of a pleural effusion, there is a risk of empyema developing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, aggressive papillary thyroid cancer, remote tobacco abuse, and a lung nodule that was surgically removed in the past. She presents with progressive shortness of breath over the past month, worsening over the last three days. Imaging reveals a new left hilar mass and post-obstructive pneumonia. There is concern for metastatic disease or a new lung primary, possibly infectious in nature. The patient meets SIRS criteria with an elevated WBC count, tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever. She has evidence of emphysema on CT chest but no active issues related to her breast or thyroid cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PLEURAL EFFUSION, EMPYEMA: The presence of a pleural effusion increases the risk of developing empyema, which is an infection within the pleural space.
2. PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP): The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. If left untreated, this can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, systemic infection, and potential sepsis.
3. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating hypotension. This can compromise tissue perfusion and may lead to organ dysfunction if not appropriately managed.

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, aggressive papillary thyroid cancer, remote tobacco abuse, and a previous left lung nodule treated with VATS. She presents with one month of progressive shortness of breath, which has worsened over the past three days. She was found to have a new left hilar mass and post-obstructive pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Left hilar mass: The patient has a 4.6cm left hilar mass with multiple hypodensities in the liver. There is concern for metastatic disease (breast, thyroid) or a new lung primary (NSCLC squamous, SCLC, lymphoma) due to her long tobacco history. An infectious process is also possible but appears less likely. Further evaluation is needed, including checking TSH, thyroglobulin, LDH, notifying Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 3650] from Oncology and PCP [Name Initial (PRE)] IP to evaluate in AM for bronch, biopsy; may require VATS, considering perc biopsy liver mass if amenable, and considering thoracentesis for cytology.

2. Pneumonia: The patient appears to have post-obstructive pneumonia due to the mass effect. She meets SIRS criteria with a WBC count of 19.6, tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever. Treatment includes Vanc,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and aggressive papillary thyroid cancer. She presented with progressive shortness of breath over the past month, which worsened in the last three days. She was found to have a new left hilar mass and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with biopsy, and her condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, pleural effusion, empyema, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hypotension, fever of unknown origin (FUO), tachycardia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern due to the presence of a left hilar mass causing post-obstructive pneumonia and potential underlying lung pathology. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pleural Effusion and Empyema: The patient's pleural effusion and empyema can lead to complications such as respiratory distress, infection spread, and potentially requiring invasive procedures like chest tube insertion for drainage.
3. Bacterial Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): The patient's pneumonia may progress and cause worsening respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammation, and potential sepsis if not appropriately managed with antibiotics and supportive care.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, aggressive papillary thyroid cancer, and remote tobacco abuse. She presents with progressive shortness of breath over the past month, worsening over the past three days. She has a new left hilar mass and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 106/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and the need for invasive ventilation indicate the possibility of acute respiratory failure.
2. Pleural Effusion, Empyema: The diminished air movement on the left side and the presence of a new left hilar mass suggest the possibility of a pleural effusion or empyema.
3. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Community Acquired (CAP): The patient's symptoms, including fever and worsening shortness of breath, along with the findings of post-obstructive pneumonia, indicate a potential bacterial community-acquired pneumonia.
4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, and remote tobacco abuse. She presents with progressive shortness of breath over the past month, which has worsened in the last three days. She was found to have a new left hilar mass and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. She is on respiratory support with a face tent and has diminished air movement on the left side. Physical examination reveals diminished air movement, egophony at the left base, and no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies indicate a 4.6 cm left hilar mass and multiple hypodensities in the liver, raising concerns for metastatic disease or a new lung primary. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypotension, fever, tachycardia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and other conditions. She is currently in the ICU and will likely be sent to the floor tomorrow. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and diminished air movement on the left side indicate the possibility of respiratory failure due to the left hilar mass causing obstruction and post-obstructive pneumonia.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of a new"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, aggressive papillary thyroid cancer, remote tobacco abuse, and a left lower lobe lung nodule that was surgically removed in the past. She presents with progressive shortness of breath over the past month, worsening over the last three days. She was found to have a new left hilar mass and post-obstructive pneumonia. There are concerns for metastatic disease from breast or thyroid cancer, or a new primary lung cancer (NSCLC squamous, SCLC, lymphoma) given her long tobacco history. She underwent a bronchoscopy with biopsy, and the results are pending. She also has pneumonia, which appears to be post-obstructive due to the mass effect. She meets the SIRS criteria with a WBC count of 19.6, tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever. Legionella is negative, and she will discontinue levofloxacin. Her antibiotics will be adjusted based on culture results. She will undergo a chest CT and isolate studies.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute pleural effusion, empyema, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hypotension, fever of unknown origin (FUO), tachycardia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and other conditions. The patient has undergone various tests and procedures including bone scan, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, pancreas culture, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They have received multiple doses of antibiotics and are currently on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs indicate an elevated temperature, increased heart rate, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments have not been performed. The patient is on face tent respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and has an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of ///31/. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of further infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), complications from the pleural effusion and empyema, electrolyte imbalances leading to cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction, and possible progression of the fever of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, aggressive papillary thyroid cancer, remote tobacco abuse, and a left lower lobe lung nodule that was previously removed via VATS and diagnosed as a benign fibrous tumor. The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath over the past month, worse over the last three days. Imaging revealed a new left hilar mass, post-obstructive pneumonia, subsegmental right basilar pulmonary embolism, and multiple liver lesions concerning for metastasis. The patient also has a bulky uterus, right pelvic lesion with coarse calcifications, and sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia due to the left hilar mass. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a subsegmental right basilar pulmonary embolism. If left untreated, it can cause further respiratory distress, hypoxia, and potentially lead to a massive pulmonary embolism with cardiovascular collapse.
3. Liver Metastasis: The presence of multiple liver lesions raises concern for metastatic disease. If confirmed, this could indicate advanced cancer with implications for further treatment options and prognosis.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be secondary to chronic disease, blood loss from the lungs, or dil"

   1. Subsegmental right basilar pulmonary embolism new since three days
   prior.
   2. Large left hilar mass, with new obliteration of the left upper lobe
   bronchus and bronchial tree, with near-complete consolidation of the
   left upper lobe and lingula. Given rapid progression, bronchoscopy is
   recommended.
   3. Moderate left pleural effusion slightly increased from three days
   prior. Increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
   4. Multiple liver lesions, some of which are cysts, others appearing
   more complex raising concern for metastasis.
   5. Bulky and heterogeneous uterus with low density in the endometrial
   cavity. Again a pelvic ultrasound is suggested for further evaluation.
   6. Underlying centrilobular emphysema.

   - Given her risk of further PE and her tenuous respiratory status and
   risk of bleeding from her lung mass after staring XRT will no
   systemically anticoagulate, will start SQH for ppx; also encourage
   ambulation.

   Also TSH slightly low on levothyroxine, but likely necessary given h/o
   thyroid cancer.  Also anemia may be component.  Her tachycardia did not
   respond to two 500 cc NS boluses overnight, so unlikely secondary to
   volume depletion.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.  Would not treat with a nodal blocking
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**] as it is likely compensatory.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of thyroid papillary carcinoma and breast cancer, currently admitted for evaluation of a left upper lobe (LUL) mass. The biopsy of the LUL mass confirmed poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), with possible metastasis to the liver.
- The patient has been treated with Unasyn for post-obstructive pneumonia, which has shown significant improvement.
- A CT angiogram (CTA) revealed a subsegmental right basilar pulmonary embolism (PE) and a large left hilar mass with near-complete consolidation of the left upper lobe and lingula.
- Moderate left pleural effusion and increased left lower lobe atelectasis were also noted.
- Multiple liver lesions were found, some of which are cysts, raising concern for metastasis.
- A bulky and heterogeneous uterus with low density in the endometrial cavity was observed.
- Centrilobular emphysema was present, and a right lower pole renal lesion could not be classified as a simple cyst, potentially representing a metastatic lesion.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 85/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nasal cannula.
- Physical examination revealed scattered crack"

   CTA ([**2-5**]):
   1. Subsegmental right basilar pulmonary embolism new since three days
   prior.
   2. Large left hilar mass, with new obliteration of the left upper lobe
   bronchus and bronchial tree, with near-complete consolidation of the
   left upper lobe and lingula. Given rapid progression, bronchoscopy is
   recommended.
   3. Moderate left pleural effusion slightly increased from three days
   prior. Increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
   4. Multiple liver lesions, some of which are cysts, others appearing
   more complex raising concern for metastasis.
   5. Bulky and heterogeneous uterus with low density in the endometrial
   cavity. Again a pelvic ultrasound is suggested for further evaluation.
   6. Underlying centrilobular emphysema.
   7. Right lower pole renal lesion cannot be classified as simple cyst,
   and could represent a metastatic lesion, although this is uncommon.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of thyroid papillary carcinoma and breast cancer, now presenting with a left upper lobe mass biopsy confirming poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma. She has been admitted to the ICU for XRT planning and IVC filter placement. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxia, post-obstructive pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, anemia, and sinus tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing increased oxygen requirements, which may be due to her underlying lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, or post-obstructive pneumonia. Oxygen therapy should be continued, and the cause of hypoxia needs to be addressed.

2. Post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient initially had pneumonia, which has improved with antibiotics (Vanc/levo/flagyl) but still requires further treatment. Sputum cultures are pending, and blood cultures should also be obtained.

3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a confirmed right basilar pulmonary embolism and may benefit from anticoagulation therapy. An IVC filter placement is planned, and consideration should be given to CTV/MRV to evaluate pelvic veins for potential deep vein thrombosis.

4. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia likely secondary to chronic inflammation and malignancy. Blood counts are otherwise within normal limits, and treatment options for anemia should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of thyroid papillary carcinoma, breast cancer, and now diagnosed with poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma. She was initially treated for post-obstructive pneumonia and later switched to Unasyn with significant improvement. The patient also has a confirmed right basilar pulmonary embolism (PE) and a left hilar mass consistent with poorly differentiated NSCLC. The patient underwent XRT mapping this morning and plans for XRT are set for today. An IVC filter placement was discussed, but the patient wants more time to think about it and will revisit the option on Monday. The patient's WBC count is down, and she is afebrile. However, she remains hypoxic, which could be due to PE, mass effect, or pneumonia. The patient has sinus tachycardia, likely secondary to active issues such as infection, PE, or compensatory response. Her anemia is normocytic and likely secondary to chronic inflammation and malignancy. The patient's Hct is stable at 26. She is being started on subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis against further PE and encouraged to ambulate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has impaired ventilation and respiratory failure due to the lung mass causing obstruction and post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient initially had post-obstructive pneumonia, which improved with"

She also has a right basilar pulmonary embolism and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient underwent radiation therapy yesterday and tolerated it well. She has been started on Unasyn with significant improvement in her condition. However, she remains hypoxic, which could be due to the pulmonary embolism and lung mass as well.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/75 to 125/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals scattered crackles in the chest and no edema in the extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's blood cultures and sputum cultures are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of thyroid papillary carcinoma, breast cancer, and now diagnosed with poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma. She has been admitted to the ICU for radiation therapy planning and IVC filter placement due to a right basilar pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed by CT angiography. The patient's current conditions include post-obstructive pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and sinus tachycardia. She is currently receiving antibiotics for pneumonia treatment and will undergo radiation therapy mapping today. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 124/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, and slightly low platelet count. The patient is currently on a 14-day course of Unasyn for pneumonia treatment. The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalance."

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of breast and thyroid cancer, currently admitted with hemoptysis and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLCa). She was originally at Hospital 3786 and transferred to this hospital to begin radiation therapy (XRT). The patient is still considering an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Her allergies are unchanged from admission, with no known drug allergies. She received doses of ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam on 02/07 and 02/08, respectively. 

In terms of medications, the patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as other ICU medications including albuterol, Tylenol PRN, [Last Name 3483], bisacodyl, atrovent, synthroid, and senna. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except where noted above and below.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.1Â°F), current temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), heart rate of 109 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 104/66 to 93/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has sinus tachycardia. 

Fluid balance shows a total inflow of 1,698 mL and outflow of 2,340 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 642 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and nasal cannula, with an ABG result of  / /25. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished and in no acute distress. Her eyes and conjunctiva are normal, and she has normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat without endotracheal, NG, or OG tubes. Her cervical lymph nodes are within normal limits, and her cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs or extra heart sounds. 

The patient's peripheral vascular examination is also normal, as are her respiratory and chest examinations. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. Extremity pulses are absent on the right and left sides, but there is no cyanosis or clubbing. Musculoskeletal examination is unremarkable, and her skin is warm without rash or ecchymoses. 

Neurologic examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and has purposeful movement"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of thyroid papillary carcinoma, breast cancer, and now diagnosed with poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma. The patient is currently in the ICU due to several medical complications. 

The patient has been diagnosed with post-obstructive pneumonia, which was initially treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl. Currently, she is on Unasyn with significant improvement. However, she still experiences hypoxia, which could be a component of pulmonary embolism (PE) and the lung mass as well. Sputum cultures and blood cultures are pending.

The patient also has a confirmed right basilar PE and would benefit from low molecular weight heparin (lovenox), but due to bleeding seen on airway, it is being held off for now. The patient has not yet made a decision regarding the placement of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, as she wants to discuss it with her family over the weekend. The interventional radiology (IR) team is ready to place the IVC filter on Monday.

The patient's sinus tachycardia could be due to multiple factors such as infection, PE, or dehydration. Despite two 500 cc normal saline boluses overnight, her tachycardia did not respond, making volume depletion less likely. Monitoring on telemetry is recommended, and treatment for heart rate below 25 is advised."

For the pulmonary embolism, the patient has a right basilar PE and would benefit from low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) due to malignancy. However, given the bleeding seen in her airway, it is being held off for now. The patient's lower extremities negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and she has been consulted with interventional radiology (IR) for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. The patient wants to talk to her family before deciding on the filter and will be ready with her decision on [**2138-2-10**]. IR can place the IVC filter on Monday.

The patient's sinus tachycardia may be caused by multiple active issues such as infection, PE, or dehydration. The patient did not respond to two 500 cc normal saline boluses overnight"

   Pt states she would like to talk to her family this weekend before
   deciding on the filter, she will be ready with her decision on

   - Per IR can place the IVC filter on Monday, however the patient is
   unsure if she wants this.  Will discuss with her family today and
   tentatively plan for placement on Monday.
   - Given her risk of further PE and her tenuous respiratory status and
   risk of bleeding from her lung mass after staring XRT will not
   systemically anticoagulate, will continue SQH for ppx; also encourage
   ambulation.
    # Sinus tachycardia: The patient continues to have HRs in the 110
s to
   120
s.  Multiple active issues could be contributing to her
   tachycardia: infxn, PE.  Also TSH slightly low on levothyroxine, but
   likely necessary given h/o thyroid cancer.  Also anemia may be
   component.  Her tachycardia did not respond to two 500 cc NS boluses a
   few days ago, so unlikely secondary to volume depletion.

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of thyroid papillary carcinoma, breast cancer, and now left upper lobe (LUL) mass biopsy confirmed as poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). She has been treated with external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and tolerated it well. The next XRT session is scheduled on [**2138-2-10**]. She will continue to be monitored for bleeding.

The patient also has post-obstructive pneumonia, initially treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl. She is now on Unasyn with significant improvement. Her white blood cell count is down, and she is afebrile. However, she still remains hypoxic, which could be due to a pulmonary embolism (PE) and her lung mass as well. Sputum culture shows only oralis growth, and she will continue with Unasyn for a total 14-day course. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient has a confirmed right basilar PE, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement has been recommended due to her malignancy. However, the patient wants to discuss this decision with her family before proceeding. The interventional radiology (IR) team is ready to place the IVC filter on Monday, but the patient is unsure at this point. She will continue to receive subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thromb"

   likely necessary given h/o thyroid cancer.  Also anemia may be
   component.  Her tachycardia did not respond to two 500 cc NS boluses a
   few days ago, so unlikely secondary to volume depletion.

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of thyroid papillary carcinoma, breast cancer, and now with left upper lobe (LUL) mass biopsy confirmed as poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). She also has right basilar pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient underwent radiation therapy (XRT) for her lung cancer and tolerated it well. However, she continues to monitor for bleeding due to her low platelet count.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with heart rates in the 110s to 120s bpm, blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on face tent 40% with 4 L NC. Her general appearance is described as thin, middle-aged female lying in bed in no acute distress. She denies pain or other complaints.

On physical examination, she has tachycardic but regular heart sounds, rhonchi present throughout the chest, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, no edema in extremities, warm skin, and alert neurologic status.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, anemia with hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, slightly low platelet count of 698 K/uL, normal creatinine of 0"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of thyroid and breast cancer, admitted to the ICU for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLCa), post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been receiving antibiotics for the PNA and is currently on day 7 of a 14-day course. She has not been on anticoagulation for the PE due to hemoptysis, and the decision regarding an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has not been made yet.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 119 beats per minute, low blood pressure ranging from 64-76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature has been within normal range.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for decreased appetite. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, decreased breath sounds on the left side with scattered rhonchi, and warm skin.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 11.2-14.4 thousand/mm3, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 0."
