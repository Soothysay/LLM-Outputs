   initially transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] [**3-13**] for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Currently, treated for pna, c diff, hypercalcemia, and transferred from
   floors to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for intubation for airway protection.
   # Respiratory failure: Likely upper-respiratory secondary to not being
   able to protect his airway from his own secretions. Patient with
   underlying malignancy, dysphagia and risk for aspiration.  He is now
   intubated and ventilated for airway protection.
   - Continue intubation given inability to protect airway
   - Repeat VBG given decrease in bicarb
   - Cont propofol titrate for sedation
   - Consult ENT for trach and IR for peg per gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs

   secondary hemodynamic effects.  He does have a leukocytosis, and will
   continue to monitor for sepsis and treat for c diff and possible
   aspiration pna.  Recent echo w/ EF 55%, unlikely to be cardiogenic
   shock. Patient did receive etomidate and given concern for TB, cortisol

   - Blood and urine cx this AM
   - Wean neo gtt as hemodynamics improve
   - Bolus IVFs prn
   # Acute anemia: HCT at 23, lowest since admission. Maybe secondary to
   dilutional from ivfs vs hemolysis vs GI bleed, although no h/o this.
   - Recheck HCT at 3pm
   - Collect type and screen
   - PIV plus PICC
   - Check hemolysis labs

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and airway protection due to dysphagia and risk for aspiration. The patient has undergone intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 117/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. His temperature is within normal range at 37.3Â°C.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 31.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 234 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypercalcemia, and is currently being treated for c.difficile and possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has concerns for latent tuberculosis, sepsis, acute anemia, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a 5 cm pleural-based mass in the lateral aspect of the right chest, consistent with his known malignancy. The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged. An endotracheal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU for airway protection due to dysphagia and risk for aspiration. The patient's chief complaints include shortness of breath and mucous plugging. 

During the course of his stay, the patient underwent intubation and was started on neo and given intravenous fluids (IVFs). He had a drop in blood pressure (hypotension) after intubation, which was likely secondary to hemodynamic effects. The patient also presented with leukocytosis and is being monitored for sepsis. 

The patient has been treated for pneumonia (pna), Clostridium difficile (c diff), and hypercalcemia. He has a history of positive PPD test, indicating latent tuberculosis (TB), and is being evaluated for potential reactivation of TB. 

Further assessments and plans include evaluating for airway obstruction, alteration in nutrition, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's current medications include cefepime for nosocomial infection, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and vancomycin for C. difficile. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 117/"

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Continues intubated, mainly
   for inability to manage secretions, mucus plugging.  Sputum sent for
   gram stain, C & S.  Difficult intubation given tongue lesion/anatomy
   per anesthesia.  Surgery recommended consulting ENT service to evaluate
   further for ?trach.  Sending sputum for AFB as well given positive PPD,
   continue respiratory precautions.  Continues cefipime.
 SCCA TONGUE WITH METS:  Unclear what the extent of his tongue lesion
   is and where he is with respect to treatment, followed at [**Hospital1 403**].
   Hosestaff to call managing oncologist there for more information.
 HYPOTENSION:  Manifested after intubation suggesting intravascular
   volume depletion in setting of poor po intake.  Responsive to IVFs
   albeit still requiring low dose neo, possible septic shock, check blood
   cultures, urine cultures. Does not appear toxic on exam.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Increasing, diff pending.  He has not been able to
   receive po vanco given unable to take po's.   Blood, sputum, urine
   cultures pending.
 ORAL THRUSH:  Also concerned for [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis given it was
   noted to be extensive when intubated by anesthesia yesterday. Starting
   fluconazole.  Will consult GI to evaluate prior to placing Dobloff
   tube. Will
 C. DIFF:  On po vanco albeit has been unable to take this.  Will give
   per rectum pending workup for ?[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13550**] prior to placing
   Dobloff.  Being evaluated for PEG.
 ANEMIA:  Hct dropped in setting of aggressive volume repletion
   overnight, likely dilutional.  No hemoptysis noted overnight.  Will
   follow serial CBCs, guaiac all stools.  For access he has a PICC and
   two peripheral IVs. Continue PPI.  Type and screen.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY:  Stage II decubitus, ?wound care consult.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION:  On TPN/lipids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure and later transferred to the ICU for intubation due to airway protection. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, esophageal candidiasis, anemia, latent tuberculosis, leukocytosis, Clostridium difficile infection, and hypercalcemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, and his vital signs are relatively stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying malignancy and airway obstruction. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require tracheostomy or extubation, depending on the discussion with the oncologist.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension after intubation, which could be due to hypovolemia or poor filling from venous return. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid administration is necessary to maintain adequate circulation.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which may be secondary to renal dysfunction or tumor lysis syndrome. Regular monitoring of potassium levels and evaluation of acid-base balance are required.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, which could be primary or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of cancer and is being treated for C. difficile infection. He also has hypercalcemia, hypotension, leukocytosis, airway obstruction, altered nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's airway obstruction and current mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection, which can cause diarrhea and abdominal pain. There is a risk of developing other infections, especially since the patient is immobile and has multiple lines and tubes.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension indicates potential cardiovascular issues. There is a risk of further cardiovascular compromise or shock.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's high calcium levels can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, or bone demineralization.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired nutrition due to altered eating habits and tube feeding may result in malnutrition and associated complications.
6. Skin Breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on ventilator support due to the inability to protect their airway. This is likely secondary to upper respiratory failure and risk for aspiration.

2. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive after intubation, which may be due to hemodynamic effects. They have leukocytosis and will be monitored for sepsis. Treatment is ongoing for C. difficile and possible aspiration pneumonia. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55%, making cardiogenic shock unlikely.

3. Acute anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is at 23, which is the lowest since admission. This could be due to dilutional from IV fluids, hemolysis, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

4. Latent TB: There is concern for potential reactivation of TB, especially with a positive PPD and tree-in-bud opacity on CT. Active TB should be ruled out.

5. Leukocytosis: This could be concerning for sepsis in the setting of pressor requirement. The patient has been treated for C. difficile, aspiration pneumonia, and malignancy.

6. C. difficile infection: The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection, which was started while at the nursing home. Stool cultures are pending"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently being treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypercalcemia, and intubation for airway protection due to dysphagia and risk for aspiration.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has underlying malignancy, dysphagia, and risk for aspiration, which could lead to respiratory failure if he is unable to protect his airway. He is already intubated and ventilated for airway protection.

2. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive after intubation, likely secondary to hemodynamic effects. There is concern for sepsis, especially with leukocytosis, and treatment for Clostridium difficile infection and possible aspiration pneumonia is ongoing.

3. Acute anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 8.1 g/dL, which may be due to dilutional from intravenous fluids, hemolysis, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Latent tuberculosis (TB): The patient has a positive PPD test and a CT scan showing tree-in-bud opacities, raising concern for latent TB. Active TB should be ruled out, especially"

   t6/t8 met.  [**7-8**] colonoscopy neg for masses/polyps.
   - Will need to discuss with outpatient oncologist regarding further
   treatment possibilities
   # Respiratory failure:
   Upper-respiratory/airway obstruction [**3-3**] cancer. Need to discuss with
   primary oncologist, but likely options are trach vs extubation that may
   be terminal.
   - discuss with [**Hospital1 403**] oncologist and HCP
   - will remain intubated for now
   - Repeat VBG given decrease in bicarb
   - Cont propofol titrate for sedation
   - Currently on cefepime for nosocomial infection, can be d/c

   # Hypotension:
   Patient became hypotensive after intubation. He does have a
   leukocytosis but afebrile and trending down. [**Month (only) 51**] be hypovolemic. Also
   considering poor filling from vetn sentting but pCO2s have been low and
   on PSV 5/5 so low likelyhood that intrathoracic pressure increased.
   Cortisol normal.
   - attempt to wean neo to keep SBP >95
   - IVF 500cc now and more prn
   # Hyperkalemia
   Renal function normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-3**] metabolic acidosis. Low suspicion for
   tumor lysis.
   - repeat K
   - ECG
   - eval acid base with repeat VBG
   #  Metabolic acidosis, non-gap
   Bicarb 20 today. No VBG from today so difficult to say whether primary
   or compensatory though in past pHs have been normal to slightly low and
   pCO2s in 20s so likely primary process. Lactate normal.
   - check VBG
   - monitor
   # Esophageal candidiasis
   - fluconazole
   # Anemia: HCT stable from yesterday
   Hemolysis labs normal.
   - Guiac all stools
   - Continue PPI
   - continue to monitor

   was unable to produce sputum and in the absence of symptoms, he did not
   undergo bronch.
   - Rule out TB, patient now intubated cont to collect 3 sets of sputum
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - last set of AFB pending
   - Continue precautions
   # Leukocytosis:
   Trending down. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-3**] cfdiff. Also treating for PNA.
   - Cont iv flagyl, po vanc, for c diff
   - Cont cefepime pending sputum cultures

   ICU Attending Note
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical housestaff.  The
   assessment and plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would
   emphasize the following.  Moderate oral secretions, minimal via ETT.
   Remains intubated for airway protection given extensive SCCa of
   tongue.  Comfortable, fully awake RRR, lungs with good air movement, no
   rales or wheeze Abdomen soft, nontender, normal bowel sounds.  No
   edema.  Oral thrush
   Clarified extent of tumor with [**Hospital1 403**] oncologist, had discussed with
   patient that there were no options for therapy that the oncologist felt
   he would tolerate.  Unclear that trach/PEG would be of benefit.
   Discussed with patient and his sister today so he is aware of
   prognosis.  Paliative care to consult with patient and family to
   continue to discuss course.
   Patient is critically ill, continues to require the ETT for airway
   protection until goals of care definitively established.
   Time spent:  35 minutes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The patient has been treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypercalcemia, and is currently in the ICU for intubation due to airway obstruction caused by the cancer.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, esophageal candidiasis, anemia, latent tuberculosis, leukocytosis, Clostridium difficile infection, and hypercalcemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to airway obstruction caused by the squamous cell carcinoma. If not managed properly, this can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or respiratory arrest.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension after intubation. This could be due to hypovolemia or poor filling of the venous system. Proper fluid management is crucial to maintain blood pressure and prevent shock.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels. This may be due to renal dysfunction or metabolic acidosis. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent cardiac complications.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which may include lactic acidosis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted to the hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure and later transferred to the ICU for intubation due to airway obstruction. The patient has been treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and hypercalcemia. He is currently deciding between terminal extubation with comfort measures and tracheostomy/peg tube placement as there are no further treatment options.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 85/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. His physical examination reveals cachexia, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no edema. Lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, hypercalcemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway Obstruction: The patient's underlying cancer may cause airway obstruction, which requires ongoing monitoring and management.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's compromised respiratory function necessitates continued ventilatory support, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure if extubation is attempted.

3. C. difficile Infection: The patient has an active C. difficile infection, which requires antibiotic treatment and bowel regimen management to prevent complications such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure and subsequently treated for pneumonia (PNA), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and hypercalcemia. The patient required intubation for airway protection and was transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure due to upper respiratory/airway obstruction and compromise caused by cancer.
- Hypotension, possibly due to hypovolemia, compromised preload from intubation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- Leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 31.3 thousand/mm3.
- C. diff infection.
- Hypercalcemia, which has since resolved after receiving pamidronate therapy.
- Esophageal candidiasis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), other: The patient has metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.
2. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, and he is being treated with IV fluids to maintain a systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 95 mmHg.
3. C. diff infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff and is currently receiving treatment. Stool cultures will be sent for further evaluation.

   Code status: FULL
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, who was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypercalcemia, and was transferred to the ICU for airway protection due to upper respiratory obstruction.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 31.3
- Anemia with a Hct of 23.1
- Hypercalcemia with a Ca++ level of 9.9 mg/dL
- Hypotension with a BP of 85/52 mmHg
- Intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode
- Oxygen saturation at 100%
- Soft and non-tender abdomen
- No edema in extremities

The patient is deciding between terminal extubation with comfort measures and tracheostomy/peg tube placement, as there are no further treatment options recommended by the oncologist.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Airway obstruction: The patient is already intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. If the airway becomes obstructed, it may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive with a BP of 85/52 mmHg. This may be due to compromised preload from intubation and positive end-expiratory pressure ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure and later transferred to the ICU for intubation due to airway obstruction. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including cancer, hypercalcemia, hypotension, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), leukocytosis, impaired skin integrity, and latent tuberculosis (TB). The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia, esophageal candidiasis, and C. diff. He is also receiving nutrition support through a feeding tube and has been prescribed medications to prevent deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: The patient's airway is currently protected by intubation, but there is a potential risk of further obstruction due to his underlying cancer.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has an active C. diff infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, potentially increasing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of malignancy, currently admitted to the ICU for airway obstruction and respiratory distress. The patient has been weaned off pressors and fluids have been given. Oncologist is unsure about end-of-life care and the patient is interested in talking to palliative care before making a decision. The patient complains of constipation and increased bowel regimen has been initiated. Allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received antibiotics including fluconazole, cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin. Infusions include enoxaparin (Lovenox) and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/52-60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory support device. The patient is awake and cachectic. Physical examination findings include coarse upper airway breath sounds and no edema. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly low sodium levels, and elevated potassium levels. Imaging studies are pending. The patient has a history of hypercalcemia, hypotension, Clostridium difficile infection, leukocytosis, airway obstruction, alteration in nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: Elevated white blood cell count and history of Clostridium difficile infection suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a history of hypercalcemia, which can lead to complications such as renal dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
6. Malnutrition: The patient has an alteration in nutrition, which can lead to malnutrition and weakened immune system.
7. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis.
8. Airway Obstruction: The patient's airway was initially obstructed, leading to respiratory distress and intubation.
9. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which indicates an increased risk of infection.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based solely on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted to Hospital 1 for hypoxic respiratory failure and later transferred to the ICU for airway protection due to upper respiratory/airway obstruction caused by cancer. The patient has been treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), hypercalcemia, and anemia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient is making decisions about end-of-life care, including the possibility of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and is being consulted with palliative care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying cancer may lead to further respiratory compromise, potentially worsening his ability to breathe independently.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient is currently being treated for C. diff, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms if appropriate precautions are not taken.
3. Hypercalcemia: Although the patient's hypercalcemia has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence due to his malignancy. Monitoring calcium levels and managing any potential imbalances is essential.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are gradually dropping, indicating a need for ongoing monitoring and potential transfusion support.
5. Esophageal candidiasis: The patient has been diagnosed with esophage"

   ICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical resident and was
   present during key portions of services provided.  The assessment and
   plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would emphasize and add
   the following.  Still with significant clear, thin secretions, more
   upper.  Stable on minimal support on the ventilator, intubated for
   airway protection given inability to manage oral secretions with SCCa
   of the tongue.  I spoke again with the patient and his sister along
   with his nurse to clarify that while trach is an option for him it will
   not alleviate his problems handling the upper airway secretions.  While
   this would likely extend his life a number of weeks, this is not
   without discomforts and we talked about his quality of life with and
   without the trach going forward.  The patient is having trouble coming
   to terms with the fact that his malignancy is incurable and that he is
   faced with these decisions but family appreciative of the ongoing
   discussions to help him understand his situation.  Patient is most
   concerned about leaving his sister alone.  We also discussed that while
   they may be interested in hospice/palliative care this will need to be
   as an inpatient as his sister would not be able to manage him at home.
   Patient is critically ill requiring intubation

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted to [Hospital 19] on [3-13] for hypoxic respiratory failure and later transferred to the ICU for intubation due to airway protection. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, anemia, Clostridium difficile infection, leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, esophageal candidiasis, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: Due to the patient's squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, there is a risk of airway obstruction, especially since he is already intubated for airway protection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure, considering his underlying malignancy and current respiratory compromise.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections or having existing infections worsen, such as candidiasis or Clostridium difficile infection, due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of blood loss from the tumor, which could result in anemia and potentially lead to further complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient may experience episodes of hypotension, which could be related to his underlying malignancy or other factors like sepsis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has a history of cancer and is currently experiencing airway protection issues.
- The patient's third sputum sample was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and precautions were discontinued.
- Stool cultures were also negative.
- The patient is being treated for candidiasis, which has improved their leukocytosis. A two-week course of Clindamycin is recommended to treat C. difficile infection.
- The patient received 1 liter of bolus in the morning and another liter in the evening to address low blood pressure (70s).
- Antibiotic cefepime was discontinued.
- Palliative care was discussed with the patient regarding prognosis and the likely ineffectiveness of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in improving survival or quality of life.
- The patient asked Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 2377] to discuss this further with their sister before making a decision.
- The patient was started on scopolamine patch for airway secretions and received ketorolac for hip pain caused by bony metastasis. Morphine IV was administered prior to movement.
- A CT scan of the neck was ordered to evaluate the extent of malignancy and determine the possibility of tracheostomy based on the patient's anatomy.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The patient received various antibiotics from [2111-3-25] to [2111-3-26].
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C (97%) and 35.7Â°C (96.3%), heart rate of 67 bpm (63-79), blood pressure ranging from 98/50 to 110/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (13-21), and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for airway protection issues.
- Fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support are being provided.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- The patient's ECG, imaging, and microbiology reports are pending.
- The patient's assessment includes cancer, hypercalcemia, hypotension, C. difficile infection, leukocytosis, airway obstruction, alteration in nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications for this patient may include worsening of airway protection issues, further spread of cancer, complications from C. difficile infection (such as diarrhea or colitis), electrolyte imbalances (due to hypercalcemia and kidney function abnormalities), and potential respiratory distress or failure if airway obstruction persists."

- He was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure and treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, hypercalcemia, and airway protection.
- The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is currently deciding between terminal extubation with comfort measures or tracheostomy/peg tube.
- The patient's cancer has progressed despite previous chemotherapy and radiation treatments.
- The patient has been diagnosed with esophageal candidiasis and is being treated with fluconazole.
- The patient's leukocytosis is trending down, and he is being treated for both pneumonia and esophageal candidiasis.
- The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for a nosocomial infection.
- The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to hypovolemia, compromised preload from intubation, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- The patient's anemia and hypotension have been addressed, but he remains on fluid resuscitation as needed.
- The patient's hypercalcemia has resolved following a single dose of pamidronate.
- The patient is being followed by palliative care and has expressed a desire to discuss the option of tracheostomy/peg tube with his sister before making a decision.

   He was initially scheduled for trach next week and PEG today; however,
   after speaking with the head and neck surgeon, he decided not to
   undergo the tracheostomy and transition to comfort oriented care. The
   PEG was cancelled and code status was changed to DNR/DNI.  Discussions
   underway about disposition and modification of treatment for his other

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and treatment of pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and hypercalcemia. The patient was intubated for airway protection and was scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. However, after discussions with the healthcare team, the patient decided against the tracheostomy and transitioned to comfort-oriented care. The PEG tube placement was also canceled, and the patient's code status was changed to Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate (DNR/DNI).

The patient has a CT scan showing a small area of soft tissue density near the endotracheal tube, which may represent synechia or scar tissue or secretion. There is also left cervical soft tissue thickening with adjacent fat stranding, which could be post-surgical and radiation therapy changes. Additionally, there is a large right chest wall mass extending into the right lung, with multifocal osseous metastasis, and multilevel degenerative disease in the cervical spine with concurrent metastasis that cannot be excluded.

The patient's vital signs are stable, and his blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels. His respiratory culture is negative for any growth. The patient's pain is being managed with oxyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of head and neck cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is airway obstruction, which is being managed with an endotracheal tube. He has been receiving mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's 24-hour events include the decision to proceed with a tracheostomy, with general surgery consulting ENT for the procedure and interventional radiology for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient also received a blood transfusion due to a low hemoglobin level. 

Medical History:
The patient has a history of head and neck cancer, for which he has undergone surgery and radiation therapy. There are no known drug allergies.

Medications:
The patient is currently receiving cefepime, fluconazole, metronidazole, vancomycin, pantoprazole, enoxaparin, and morphine sulfate. He has previously received other medications as well.

Review of Systems:
The patient has an oral-gastric (OG/NG) tube in place and a Foley catheter. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the OG/NG tube.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/63-124/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breath"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently being treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypercalcemia, and anemia. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues including airway obstruction, impaired nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and leukocytosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if extubation is attempted.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection, as indicated by the positive respiratory culture for yeast. This increases the risk of worsening pneumonia and potential spread of the infection.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient is currently being treated for CDI, and there is a risk of recurrence or complications such as colitis.
4. Hypercalcemia: Although the patient's hypercalcemia has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence, especially considering the underlying malignancy.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been gradually dropping, indicating ongoing blood loss from the tumor or other sources. Transfusion may be required to maintain adequate oxygenation.
6. Esophageal Candidiasis: The patient is receiving treatment for esophageal candidiasis, and there is a"

   He was initially scheduled for trach next week and PEG today; however,
   after speaking with the head and neck surgeon, he decided not to
   undergo the tracheostomy and transition to comfort oriented care. The
   PEG was cancelled and code status was changed to DNR/DNI.  Discussions
   underway about disposition and modification of treatment for his other

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**3-13**] for hypoxic respiratory failure. Currently, he is being treated for pneumonia (pna), Clostridium difficile (c diff), hypercalcemia, and has been transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for intubation due to airway protection.

The patient was initially scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today, but after speaking with the head and neck surgeon, he decided against the tracheostomy and transitioned to comfort-oriented care. The PEG was also canceled, and his code status was changed to DNR/DNI. Discussions are underway regarding his disposition and modification of treatment for his other conditions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 136/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. He is extubated and comfortable.

The patient has several medical conditions, including anemia, Clostridium difficile infection, esophageal candidiasis, hypotension, latent tuberculosis, and hypercalcemia. He is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including IV morphine for pain"

   MICU WEEKEND COVERAGE ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10958**]
s above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events: Code status DNR/DNI; extubated.
   Currently c/o pain, better when he lies still.  Coughing sputum, but
   swallowing.  No dyspnea.
   Afebrile P70-80, 130/70.  RR16-50 Sat >=90%.
   Exam notable for Thin man, lying in bed in NAD.  Neck with fibrotic
   changes on skin.  Awake, alert, responsive.  B/L ronchi, few crackles.
   RRR S1 S2.  Abd soft +BS NT.  No peripheral edema.
   Labs notable for WBC 14 down from 30
s, Hct 31, Plt 213, normal
   electrolytes.  INR 1.1.
   Meds include: PO Vanc, flagyl, fluconazole.
   Agree with plan to continue antibiotics (Cdiff positive at OSH) and
   transfer to hospice care vs floor if hospice not available, code status
   is DNR/DNI.  Will keep OGT for now for PO meds.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**3-13**] for hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), hypercalcemia, and transferred to the ICU for intubation due to airway protection. The patient was scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) but decided against the tracheostomy and transitioned to comfort-oriented care. Code status was changed to DNR/DNI, and discussions are ongoing about disposition and modification of treatment for other conditions.

24-hour events:
- The patient was set up for a tracheostomy and PEG but changed his mind after speaking with the head and neck surgeon, hearing about substantial risks and minimal benefit.
- The patient is now comfort measures only (CMO) and will be discharged to hospice. Continuing to treat C. diff and esophageal candidiasis.
- The patient was extubated and comfortable.

Allergies:
- No known drug allergies.

Last dose of antibiotics:
- Cefepime: [**2111-3-25**] 10:16 AM
- Fluconazole: [**2111-3-26**] 02:22 PM
- Metronidazole: [**2111-3"

   1. Patent airway with endotracheal tube in place. Minimal soft tissue
   thickening at the level of cricoid and thyroid cartilage likely
   represents
   vocal cords, although further evaluation in this region is limited due
   to presence of the tube. A small area of ill-defined density anterior
   to the
   endotracheal tube just below the level of vocal cord (301B, 70) may
   represent
   synechia or scar tissue or secretion.
   2. Left cervical soft tissue thickening with adjacent fat stranding may
   represent post-surgical and radiation therapy change in this region.
   Partial
   strap muscle resection and submental surgical clips evident on the
   left.
   3. Partial visualization of a large right chest wall mass extending
   into
   right lung with multifocal osseous metastasis.
   4. Multilevel degenerative disease in the cervical spine, concurrent
   metastasis cannot be excluded.
   5. Subcentimeter left thyroid nodule may be further evaluated by
   ultrasound on non-emergent basis as clinically indicated.
   6. Partially visualized endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left
   approach central venous catheter appear to be in expected locations.

There is minimal soft tissue thickening at the level of cricoid and thyroid cartilage, which may represent vocal cords. However, further evaluation in this region is limited due to the presence of the endotracheal tube. There is also a small area of ill-defined density anterior to the endotracheal tube just below the level of the vocal cord, which may represent synechia or scar tissue or secretion.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, presenting with shortness of breath and mucous plugging. He was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure and treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and hypercalcemia. He was later transferred to the ICU for intubation due to airway protection.

The patient's medical history includes cancer, hypercalcemia, hypotension, Clostridium difficile infection, leukocytosis, airway obstruction, altered nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including vancomycin, flagyl, fluconazole, oxycodone, fentanyl patch, and scopalamine. His current treatment plan includes continuing PO vanc per OG tube, IV flagyl, and a 2-week course of fluconazole starting from [**2111-3-23**].

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8Â°C (96.4Â°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/65 to 153/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm. His weight has decreased from 50.8 kg at admission to 49 kg currently.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (31.3 K/uL), low hemoglobin (11.0 g/dL), low sodium (135 mEq/L), high potassium (5.6 mEq/L), elevated blood urea nitrogen (16 mg/dL), high creatinine (0.9 mg/dL), and low platelet count (194 K/uL).

The patient's imaging results indicate the presence of Clostridium difficile toxin A & B in the stool, as well as yeast growth on fungal culture.

The patient's assessment and plan include cancer, hypercalcemia, hypotension, Clostridium difficile infection, leukocytosis, airway obstruction, altered nutrition, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has chosen comfort-oriented care, and the tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures have been canceled. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and discussions are underway regarding disposition and modification of treatment for his other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure due to continued airway obstruction, further progression of Clostridium difficile infection, development of nosocomial pneumonia, worsening of hypercalcemia, and potential worsening of the patient's overall condition due to comfort-oriented care measures."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and mucous plugging. The patient is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including cancer (malignant neoplasm), hypercalcemia (high calcium), hypotension (not in shock), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), leukocytosis, airway obstruction in the central/upper region, alteration in nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's shortness of breath and mucous plugging may indicate potential respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The presence of a Clostridium difficile infection suggests the possibility of other infections, including bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, or wound infections.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension could be a sign of inadequate organ perfusion and may lead to complications like organ failure or shock.
4. Malnutrition: The alteration in nutrition mentioned in the patient's history suggests a risk of malnutrition, which can weaken the immune system and delay healing.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can lead to infection and other complications.
6. Airway Obstruction: The central/upper airway obstruction can cause respiratory compromise and may require intervention to maintain adequate airflow.
7. Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium levels can affect various organ systems, including the kidneys, heart, and brain. It may lead to complications like renal dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Leukocytosis: An elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, which needs to be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
9. Cancer Progression: The presence of cancer increases the risk of disease progression and potential complications related to metastasis or treatment-related toxicities.

These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being and prevent further deterioration."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure and treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypercalcemia, and transferred to the ICU for intubation due to airway protection. The patient decided against tracheostomy and transitioned to comfort-oriented care, canceling the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and changing code status to comfort measures only (CMO). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial admission was for hypoxic respiratory failure, which indicates a potential complication related to his underlying squamous cell carcinoma affecting the airways.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, requiring treatment with antibiotics and discontinuation of certain medications.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient was treated for hypercalcemia, which can be a complication of malignancy, particularly squamous cell carcinoma.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to chronic disease or blood loss from the tumor.
5. Esophageal candidiasis: The patient developed esophageal candidiasis, likely as a result of immunosuppression and antifungal therapy.
6. Hypotension: The patient required aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain blood pressure, indicating potential cardiovascular instability.

   Currently, treated for pna, c diff, hypercalcemia, and transferred from
   floors to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for intubation for airway protection.
   .
   He was initially scheduled for trach next week and PEG today; however,
   after speaking with the head and neck surgeon, he decided not to
   undergo the tracheostomy and transition to comfort oriented care. The
   PEG was cancelled and code status was changed to CMO.  Plan to treat C.
   Diff colitis, no longer following daily labs.

   # Pain control
 fentanyl path dose yesterday, also on oxycodone prn.
   - Increase fentanyl patch as needed for pain control
   .
   # C diff:
   Was on vanc/flagyl because with increasing leukocytosis while on flagyl
   but this may have been from esophageal candidiasis.
   - Continue PO vanc per OG tube (we will leave the OG tube in as long as
   patient can tolerate)
   - Cont  IV flagyl for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. He was initially admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure and treated for pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and hypercalcemia. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to airway compromise due to upper airway secretions and squamous cell carcinoma. 

The patient's current medical complications include anemia, esophageal candidiasis, hypotension, latent tuberculosis, and a history of hypercalcemia. The patient has also been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff colitis) and leukocytosis. 

In terms of treatment, the patient's code status has been changed to comfort-oriented measures (CMO), and he has decided against tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Pain control is being managed with increased doses of fentanyl patch as needed. 

The patient is currently on a 2-week course of oral vancomycin for C. diff colitis and intravenous metronidazole. Esophageal candidiasis is being treated with a 2-week course of fluconazole. Hypotension is managed with intravenous fluids (IVF) as needed. 

The patient's nutrition is being maintained through an ongoing effort, although there is an alteration in nutrition due to his condition. Glycemic control and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis"

The patient is a male with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of cancer and is currently receiving comfort care. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and treatment for Clostridium difficile infection. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6Â°C (96Â°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 140/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and is alert and oriented. His lab results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis is a serious medical complication that requires immediate attention. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Cancer progression: As the patient has a history of cancer and is receiving comfort care, there is a risk of cancer progression and further complications related to the malignancy.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. It is important to complete the course of Flagyl to treat the infection and prevent complications such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and"
