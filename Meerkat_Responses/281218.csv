","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. 

The patient underwent an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion and is currently on mechanical ventilation with continuous EEG monitoring due to a seizure episode. He has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and acute renal failure, likely pre-renal in nature. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 34.3Â°C, blood pressure of 102/42 mmHg, heart rate of 44 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His current rhythm is slow atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, troponin T, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). His electrolytes are within normal limits. 

The patient is on multiple medications, including aspirin, statin, heparin, furosemide, dopamine, midazolam, and fentanyl.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and a bifascicular block. He was transferred from another location after experiencing a ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest.

The patient has been in the ICU since then and has had several significant events and medical complications. These include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been in the mid to upper 20s, which is considered bradycardic. Dopamine infusion was started to increase the heart rate to the 40s.

2. Seizure: At 6:30 a.m., the patient experienced a likely seizure episode that lasted about one minute. It was resolved with midazolam and fentanyl boluses. Continuous EEG monitoring has been initiated, and a neuro consultation has been requested.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's EF is 40-45%, indicating reduced cardiac function. He also has low cardiac index (CI) with high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), which suggests cardiogenic shock. The patient is on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and is receiving diuretics"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 40-45%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and bifascicular block. He was transferred from another location after experiencing a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest. The patient underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol and was rewarmed overnight.

The patient has shown improvement in his neurological status, with the ability to follow commands and answer questions with nodding. However, his neurologic exam showed some abnormalities, including moving his head towards voice but unable to follow commands, PERRLA (pupils equal and reactive to light and accommodation), and a flat babinski reflex.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 41-92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 78-142 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 8-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP 5/5 and is expected to be extubated in the afternoon.

The patient has ongoing issues with elevated liver enzymes, acute renal failure with worsening creatinine from 1.6 to 1.7, and a decrease in platelet count"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and bifascicular block. The patient was transferred from another location after experiencing a ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. 

The patient's recent events include exercise-induced VT/VF likely related to ischemia, initiation of an Arctic Sun cooling protocol for temperature management, and rewarmed overnight. The patient also had a seizure episode yesterday, but no epileptiform activity was seen on EEG. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP 5/5 and is expected to be extubated later today. The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) likely related to the ischemic insult during the arrest. There is also evidence of acute renal failure, with a worsening creatinine level from 1.6 to 1.7 this morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's EF is low at 40-45%, indicating reduced cardiac output. This can lead to cardiogenic shock, which is supported by the finding of low cardiac index (CI) with high pulmonary capillary wedge"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to a cardiac arrest and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include a trans thoracic echo showing focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with prior inferior myocardial infarction, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild aortic regurgitation. The right ventricle appears dilated and hypokinetic. The patient's neuro exam at 2am showed slight head movement towards voice, inability to follow commands, pupils reactive and equal, and flat babinski sign. An EEG was reviewed, revealing no epileptiform activity, and a CT head has been requested. The patient has been started on ASA and Lipitor, systemic heparin was discontinued, and a new order for IABP heparin was placed. The rewarming process began at 6pm with a neuro exam to be performed afterward. The patient's platelet count has been dropping, but there have been no signs of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and bifascicular block. He presented to the ICU after experiencing ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient underwent active internal rewarming and is currently in the rewarming phase. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is reported to be 40-45%, indicating reduced cardiac function. This may contribute to cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by low cardiac index and high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3, which has worsened to 1.7. This suggests possible pre-renal acute renal failure, likely secondary to recent arrest and decreased renal perfusion.
3. Seizure activity: The patient had suspected seizure activity yesterday, but no epileptiform activity was observed on EEG. Continuous EEG monitoring should continue, and further evaluation of the seizure activity is needed.
4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated, likely related to the ischemic insult during arrest. Trends in LFTs should be monitored.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not explicitly mentioned. However, the note highlights several significant events that occurred within a 24-hour period. These events include the patient being placed on invasive ventilation, blood and urine cultures being taken, extubation, recommendation for neuroimaging, administration of vitamin K due to rising INR, detection of a urinary tract infection (UTI), and initiation of antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and an unknown allergy. The last dose of antibiotics given was not specified. The patient is receiving various infusions and other medications in the ICU.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the newly identified UTI. The vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a current temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate within normal range, slightly low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume of 585-718 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and an ABG result of 7"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 40-45%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and bifascicular block. He was transferred from another location after experiencing a ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol and was rewarmed overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has a low cardiac index with a high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), indicating cardiogenic shock. He also has focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation, which are consistent with a previous inferior myocardial infarction. The patient is being managed with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) until his International Normalized Ratio (INR) is lowered, and he will receive a small dose of vitamin K if his INR continues to rise. Repeat echocardiogram is planned in the next few days.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in slow atrial fibrillation. He will be monitored on telemetry, and hospital pads will be kept in place. His electrolytes should be repleted as needed, and his INR should be managed carefully"

   Vtach/Vfib arrest.
   .
   # s/p arrest: Unclear how long patient was down. Exercise-induced VT/VF
   likely related to ischemia. S/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol. Mental
   status is improving.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - continue to monitor mental status
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Echo [**2-14**] showing focal LV systolic dysfunction
   consistent with prior inferior MI; Moderate mitral and mild aortic
   regurgitation; right ventricle is not well seen but is probably
   dilated/hypokinetic. Now off intraaortic balloon pump and off pressors.
   Appears euvolemic.
   - hold on further diuresis, as pt appears clinically euvolemic and
   hypovolemic by urine lytes
   - repeat echo in the next few days
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - monitor on tele
   - restart Coumadin
   - INR subtherapeutic; want to hold off on restarting Coumadin in
   setting of Hct drop
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 29.2, from 34.7 yesterday and 40.7 on [**2-15**]. No evidence
   of bleeding. Could have been hemolyzing in setting of balloon pump.
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - Check hemolysis labs
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to balloon pump. Not likely HIT.
   - repeat CBC
   - avoid heparin products once IABP is removed
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: Trop 1.23 on admission, likely due to
   arrest/CPR. Stress test showed dynamic ST depressions in V2-V6 prior to
   arrest, with ST elevations in I and aVL.  Has chronic ischemic
   cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45%.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - Lipitor 80 mg daily
   - repeat cath when more stable
   - consider restarting beta blocker/[**Last Name (un) 284**]
   .
   # Hypertension: Initially presented in cardiogenic shock, but BP now
   increasing off pressors and balloon pump.
   - slowly restart home meds, including beta
   blocker/[**Last Name (un) 284**]/felodipine/Lasix/spironolactone

   # Elevated LFTs: Likely related to ischemic insult in setting of
   arrest.  Trending down.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 40-45%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and bifascicular block.
- The patient presented with cardiogenic shock and underwent an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) and was on pressors. He is now off the IABP and pressors.
- The patient had a ventricular tachycardia/vibratory arrest and underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. His mental status is improving.
- The patient's cardiogenic shock is being managed, and he appears euvolemic. It is recommended to hold further diuresis, as the patient appears clinically euvolemic and hypovolemic by urine electrolytes. A repeat echocardiogram in the next few days is advised.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin. His INR is subtherapeutic, so restarting Coumadin is being held off due to Hct drop.
- The patient has anemia with a Hct of 29.2, from 34.7 yesterday and 40.7 on [**2-15**]. No evidence of bleeding is observed, and it could have been hemolyzing in the setting of the balloon pump"

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 40-45%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and bifascicular block. He was transferred from another location after experiencing a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest. The patient underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol and showed improvement in mental status.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coronary artery disease, seizure activity, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and acute renal failure. He has been started on ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and had the aortic balloon pump (IABP) discontinued.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 80 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 129/60 mmHg to 152/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -700 mL since 33 AM.

The patient's physical examination reveals alertness, orientation, and ability to move all four extremities. He has no murmurs or gallops"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo M with CAD s/p CABG ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 40-45%, Afib on
   Coumadin, HTN, MR, TR, bifascicular block transferred from [**Location (un) 78**] s/p
   Vtach/Vfib arrest.
   .
   # s/p arrest: Exercise-induced VT/VF likely related to ischemia. S/p
   Arctic Sun cooling protocol. Mental status dramatically improved.
   - plan for ICD with UTI cleared
   - continue to monitor mental status
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - monitor on tele
   - give one dose of Coumadin today, but would like to keep INR<2.0 for
   now for ICD placement
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding.
   - daily CBC
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to balloon pump. Not likely HIT, but
   will hold heparin products for now
   - trend platelets
   - avoid heparin products for now
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: Trop 1.23 on admission, likely due to
   arrest/CPR. Stress test showed dynamic ST depressions in V2-V6 prior to
   arrest, with ST elevations in I and aVL.  Has chronic ischemic
   cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45%.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - Lipitor 80 mg daily
   - repeat cath when more stable
   - restart beta blocker
   .
   # Hypertension: Initially presented in cardiogenic shock, but BP now
   increasing off pressors and balloon pump.
   - slowly restart home meds, including beta
   blocker/[**Last Name (un) 284**]/felodipine/Lasix/spironolactone
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Likely related to ischemic insult in setting of
   arrest.  Trending down.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine was 1.6 on admission, now 1.2. Was
   pre-renal in the setting of cardiac arrest/cardiac shock. Renal
   function improving.
   - trend Cr
   .
   # UTI: urine culture growing E. coli.
   - f/u sensitivities on urine cultures
   - continue cipro
   .
   # Glaucoma: restart home Xalatan
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Advance diet.  Remove NG tube.
   Glycemic Control:  none
   Lines: Consider d/c of central line today if additional peripheral
   access can be obtained.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 40-45%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and bifascicular block. He was transferred from another location after experiencing a ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, for which he underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. His mental status improved dramatically following the arrest.

The patient's current plan includes the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) once the urinary tract infection (UTI) is cleared. His mental status is to be continuously monitored. He is also on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, with an INR target of less than 2.0 at this time due to the planned ICD placement.

The patient has stable hematocrit levels, indicating no evidence of bleeding, and will have daily complete blood counts (CBCs) to monitor for anemia. Thrombocytopenia is suspected to be related to the balloon pump, and heparin products will be avoided for now. Platelet trends will be monitored.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, as evidenced by elevated troponin levels on admission and dynamic ST depressions in"
