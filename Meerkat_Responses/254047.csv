","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a chief complaint of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has a history of cirrhosis, varices, possible EtOH abuse, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted on [**2-18**] and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed gastric and esophageal varices. He received 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was started on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Initially, the patient stabilized and was planned for discharge, but today he experienced another episode of UGIB. Repeat EGD revealed varices with fresh blood in the stomach, leading to the consideration of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient received additional blood transfusion and is relatively stable with a blood pressure (BP) of 121/45 mmHg.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

   GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   81 yo man with recent diagnosis of liver cirrhosis c/b varices
   transferred from OSH for recurrent variceal bleed.
   .
   # UGIB: On EGD from [**2-18**] and [**2-28**], pt found to have gastric varices
   which appear to be the likely source of his recurrent bleed. S/p [**2-21**]
   units pRBC over OSH course; no active bleeding seen on OSH EGD today
   and currently HD stable with appropriate Hct response. Still with tarry
   stools but likely residual from prior bleeding.  Transferred for
   consideration of TIPS procedure; not encephalopathic and without
   profound coagulopathy but may be limited by age. Patient with multiple
   episodes of dark stool overnight but ~stable Hct at 30 this morning.
   - NPO for now
   - Active T&S, 2 units cross-matched, large bore PIV x 2, trend Hct q6h
   - Transfuse for goal Hct <25 due to risk of rebound bleed with portal
   hypertension
   - Octreotide gtt x 5 days
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Ppx with ceftriaxone
   - follow serologies
   - Holding nadolol for now; avoid IVF if possible
 if SBPs continue
   120s and bleeding resolves, would restart nadolol
   - RUQ ultrasound with doppler to evaluate portal vein patency
   - Appreciate Liver recs; if patient with recurrent hematemesis or brisk
   bleed, will page for urgent evaluation
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis: Recent diagnosis based on radiographic findings in
   work-up of LE edema with evidence of portal hypertension given
   esophageal and gastric varices.  Synthetic function slightly impaired
   with mildly elevated INR and low albumin; MELD score 13 -> 12.  Given
   history of alcohol abuse and AST/ALT (although only minimally elevated
   now), etiology may be alcoholic.  Ddx includes hepatitis B or C,
   autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirrhosis,
   Wilson's disease, Budd-Chiari.  Pt used to take Tylenol PM but has not
   taken this in the past month; again, labs do not suggest fulminant
   liver failure.
   - Trend LFTs, coags
   - Add on hep serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-SM Ab, AMA, iron panel,
   ceruloplasmin (pending)
   - Add on AFP
   - RUQ ultrasound as above
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   - SW consult for substance abuse/coping
   .
   # LE edema: Likely due to hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension in
   setting of liver failure. No DVT on OSH LENIs.  No overt evidence of
   cellulitis; pt treated with vanc/ceftriaxone for unclear duration at
   OSH. TSH 0.39.  Albumin 2.8.
   - Hold antibiotics for cellulitis for now
   - holding diuretics in setting of bleed, when resolves would restart
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.17 at OSH on [**2-25**].  Here, Cr is 1.4.  Hepatorenal syndrome
   possible but clinical picture not c/w severe cirrhosis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to recent diuresis although pt was reportedly taking these
   medications prior to admission.  Was noted to be relatively hypotensive
   in setting of bleed but without other objective signs of hypoperfusion.
   Cr stable at 1.4 this morning. Urine lytes most consistent with
   intrarenal process; negative urine eosinophils make AIN less likely.
   Possibly ATN
 will monitor.
   - Trend Cr
   - Urine sediment examination if possible
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; down to 135 this morning. Likely related to
   cirrhosis/splenic sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding
   .
   # Hoarse voice: Pt is s/p short intubation course but reports normal
   voice until today.  No cough, no e/o airway compromise. Did undergo EGD
   today and has been NPO all day with dry mm on exam. TSH WNL.
   - Consider ENT evaluation
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - Cont levothyroxine (112mcg po ~> 50mcg IV for now); unclear why pt
   getting 125 mcg IV at OSH (though this may explain low-normal TSH)
   .
   # Thyroid nodule: Continue outpatient monitoring
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, will discuss advancing diet with
   liver service

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with recent diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, who was transferred from another hospital for recurrent variceal bleeding. He has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from gastric varices as confirmed by endoscopy. The patient received 21 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) during his course at the previous hospital, and his current hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable at 30%. He has tarry stools but is hemodynamically stable.

The patient's laboratory values show mild coagulopathy with an elevated INR of 1.4, low albumin level of 2.8 g/dL, and mildly elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). The MELD score is 12, suggesting moderately severe liver disease. Other lab results include normal white blood cell count, platelet count, and electrolyte levels, except for a slightly low calcium level of 8.1 mg/dL.

The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema due to hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension secondary to liver failure. There is no evidence of cellulitis, but he has been receiving antibiotics for an unclear duration. His thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is normal, indicating no evidence of hypothyroidism.

The patient also has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, which has been stable since admission. Hepatoren"

   GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   81 yo man with recent diagnosis of liver cirrhosis c/b varices
   transferred from OSH for recurrent variceal bleed.
   .
   # UGIB: On EGD from [**2-18**] and [**2-28**], pt found to have gastric varices
   which appear to be the likely source of his recurrent bleed. S/p [**2-21**]
   units pRBC over OSH course; no active bleeding seen on OSH EGD today
   and currently HD stable with appropriate Hct response. Still with tarry
   stools but likely residual from prior bleeding.  Transferred for
   consideration of TIPS procedure; not encephalopathic and without
   profound coagulopathy but may be limited by age. Patient with multiple
   episodes of dark stool overnight but ~stable Hct at 30 this morning.
   - NPO for now
   - Active T&S, large bore PIV x 2, trend Hct q6h
   - Transfuse for goal Hct <25 due to risk of rebound bleed with portal
   hypertension
   - Octreotide gtt x 5 days
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Ppx with ceftriaxone
   - Holding nadolol for now; avoid IVF if possible
 if SBPs continue
   120s and bleeding resolves, would restart nadolol
   - RUQ ultrasound with doppler to evaluate portal vein patency
   - Appreciate Liver recs; if patient with recurrent hematemesis or brisk
   bleed, will page for urgent evaluation
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis: Recent diagnosis based on radiographic findings in
   work-up of LE edema with evidence of portal hypertension given
   esophageal and gastric varices.  Synthetic function slightly impaired
   with mildly elevated INR and low albumin; MELD score 13 -> 12.  Given
   history of alcohol abuse and AST/ALT (although only minimally elevated
   now), etiology may be alcoholic.  Ddx includes hepatitis B or C,
   autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirrhosis,
   Wilson's disease, Budd-Chiari.  Pt used to take Tylenol PM but has not
   taken this in the past month; again, labs do not suggest fulminant
   liver failure.
   - Trend LFTs, coags
   - Add on hep serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-SM Ab, AMA, iron panel,
   ceruloplasmin (pending)
   - Add on AFP
   - RUQ ultrasound as above
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   - SW consult for substance abuse/coping
   .
   # LE edema: Likely due to hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension in
   setting of liver failure. No DVT on OSH LENIs.  No overt evidence of
   cellulitis; pt treated with vanc/ceftriaxone for unclear duration at
   OSH. TSH 0.39.  Albumin 2.8.
   - Hold antibiotics for cellulitis for now
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.17 at OSH on [**2-25**].  Here, Cr is 1.4.  Hepatorenal syndrome
   possible but clinical picture not c/w severe cirrhosis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to recent diuresis although pt was reportedly taking these
   medications prior to admission.  Was noted to be relatively hypotensive
   in setting of bleed but without other objective signs of hypoperfusion.
   Cr stable at 1.4 this morning. Urine lytes most consistent with
   intrarenal process; negative urine eosinophils make AIN less likely.
   Possibly ATN
 will monitor.
   - Trend Cr
   - Urine sediment examination if possible
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; plts 114
   today at OSH and 150 here; down to 135 this morning. Likely related to
   cirrhosis/splenic sequestration.
   - Trend
   .
   # Hoarse voice: Pt is s/p short intubation course but reports normal
   voice until today.  No cough, no e/o airway compromise. Did undergo EGD
   today and has been NPO all day with dry mm on exam. TSH WNL.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] improve when able to take po take; monitor for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old man with recent diagnosis of liver cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital for recurrent variceal bleeding. The patient has been diagnosed with gastric varices as the likely source of his recurrent bleed. He has received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells and is currently hemodynamically stable with appropriate hematocrit response. The patient has tarry stools, which are likely residual from prior bleeding. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed:
1. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB): The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric varices. He is currently being managed with NPO (nothing by mouth), large bore peripheral IV lines, close monitoring of hematocrit, transfusion for goal hematocrit <25, octreotide infusion, IV pantoprazole, and prophylactic antibiotics with ceftriaxone. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure is being considered for this patient.
2. LIVER CIRRHOSIS: The patient has recently been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis based on radiographic findings in the work-up of lower extremity edema with evidence of portal hypertension. The synthetic function of the liver is slightly impaired, as indicated by a mildly elevated INR and low albumin levels. The MEL"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recurrent variceal bleed. He was transferred for TIPS evaluation and has had intermittent episodes of maroon stool and a recent episode of BRBPR (150cc) with positive NGT lavage, concerning for upper GI bleed. He remains hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit in the low thirties. The plan is for a TIPS procedure today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent variceal bleed, as well as the recent episode of BRBPR and positive NGT lavage, indicates a potential upper GI bleed. This can lead to hypotension, shock, and potential need for blood transfusion.
2. Liver cirrhosis: The patient has evidence of portal hypertension with gastric and esophageal varices. This can result in complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's reported history of thrombocytopenia and platelet counts of 114 and 150 suggest a potential risk for bleeding due to low platelet count.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient had an elevated creatinine level at OSH but has been trending down. This may indicate a resolving AR"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recurrent variceal bleed. He was transferred for TIPS evaluation. The patient has had intermittent episodes of maroon stool and an episode of blood-tinged aspirate via nasogastric tube (150cc). He remains hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit in the low thirties. The plan for TIPS procedure today was discussed with the liver and IR service.

The patient also presents with shortness of breath, which is likely multifactorial. This includes peripheral edema, hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary edema on imaging consistent with volume overload, possible upper airway obstruction following recent intubation, and a history of COPD.

Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 147, likely due to decreased access to free water in the setting of NPO. He also has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level trending down to baseline. There is a possibility of ATN in the setting of relative hypotension due to GI bleed. 

Furthermore, the patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 114 today at OSH and 150 here, down to 135 this morning. This is likely related to cirrhosis/splenic sequestration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a chief complaint of intermittent episodes of maroon stool. The patient had an episode of 150cc blood-tinged red blood product return (BRBPR) and gross blood in the nasogastric tube lavage. The patient was made NPO (nothing by mouth) and is scheduled for a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure today. The patient's sodium level is trending up to 147, so D5W (5% dextrose in water) is being started overnight.

The patient also complains of increasing shortness of breath and stridor in the evening, with crackles at the bases. A chest X-ray shows mild volume overload. The patient was given IV fluids were discontinued, Lasix 20 IV was administered, and the patient was placed on humidified oxygen with ice chips/sips. There was improvement in symptoms.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone, was given at [**2107-3-2**] 12:01 AM. The patient is currently receiving octreotide at 50 mcg/hour and furosemide (Lasix) at [**2107-3-1**] 03:30 PM. Pantoprazole (Protonix) was also started at [**2107-3-2**] 12:01 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

Laboratory results include a WBC count of 7.4, Hct of 31.2%, Plt of 150,000, Cr of 1.4, Glucose of 109 mg/dL, and other lab values as indicated. The patient has a positive Smooth sign and negative Doctor First Name sign.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's high sodium level and history of cirrhosis increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's episodes of maroon stool and gross blood in the NG tube lavage suggest ongoing upper GI bleeding.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's increasing shortness of breath, stridor, and crackles at the bases indicate respiratory distress, which could be due to fluid overload or another underlying cause.
4. Hepatitis: The pending hepatitis studies indicate a possible underlying hepatitis infection.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's renal dysfunction and cirrhosis increase the risk of hepatorenal syndrome.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection.
7. Hepatic hydrothorax: The patient's bibasilar crackles and history of cirrhosis increase the risk of hepatic hydrothorax."

   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and last night episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit in the low
   thirties.  Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS
   procedure.
   - NPO for now
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25

   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - SBT this morning; will attempt extubation today
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -humidified O2/ice chips with improvement of hoarseness
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 147 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - 100cc D5W for 1 liter
   - trend sodium Q8hr
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], now increased again to 1.6.
   Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative eosinophils.
   Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in TIPS
   procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Restart Lasix
   - trend creatinine [**Hospital1 **]

   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**]. Possible infectious etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS.
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and last night episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit in the low
   thirties.  Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS
   procedure.
   - NPO for now
   - 2 large bore PIV (18)
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - SBT this morning
   - repeat bronchoscopy; if stable will extubate today.
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -humidified O2/ice chips with improvement of hoarseness
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 147 this AM likely due to decreased
   access to free water in setting of NPO
   - 100cc D5W for 1 liter
   - trend sodium Q8hr
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load yesterday.  Urine lytes suggest
   intra-renal process with negative eosinophils.  Likely contrast
   nephropathy due to increased dye load in TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF
   - trend creatinine [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now improved to 241. Likely related to
   cirrhosis/splenic sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - Cont levothyroxine

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recurrent variceal bleed. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, and melena. The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and was found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices, which were thought to be the source of bleeding.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Vital signs: Tcurrent 35.9째C (96.6째F), HR 52 bpm, BP 125/49 mmHg, RR 25 breaths per minute, SpO2 99%.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with evidence of small amount of blood in the oropharynx.
- Bibasilar crackles and mild pulmonary edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.
- Peripheral edema and hypoalbuminemia.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that may contribute to poor baseline respiratory function.
- No evidence of infectious process.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of recurrent variceal bleeding, and there is ongoing blood loss from the gastric varices. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and hematocrit levels is necessary. Continued use of octreotide and proton pump inhibitor (P"

 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2107-3-2**] 05:04 PM
   - Patient went for TIPS.  Very difficult airway/intubation that
   required fiberoptic intubation.  Noted a large amount of thick
   secretions during intubation.  Underwent TIPS with moderate blood
   loss.  Briefly started on neosynephrine while in procedure, but able to
   be easily weaned once back in MICU.
   - Had bedside bronchoscopy to evaluated for thick secretions; saw only
   thin secretions though copious fresh blood around the vocal cords with
   edema.  Pt remained intubated for the night and will likely re-bronch
   in the morning prior to extubation.
   - had hypotension after starting propofol for sedation - started on
   neosynephrine and have been weaning as tolerated.

 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure

   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - SBT this morning; will attempt extubation today

   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.

   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.

   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], now increased again to 1.6.
   Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative eosinophils.
   Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in TIPS
   procedure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recurrent variceal bleed. The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure due to a recent episode of bleeding. However, the procedure was difficult and required fiberoptic intubation. The patient also experienced hypotension after receiving propofol for sedation and required neosynephrine.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a recent bronchoscopy revealing fresh blood and edema around the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning and attempt extubation today.

The patient's liver cirrhosis is complicated by portal hypertension, as evidenced by the presence of gastric and esophageal varices. The patient's synthetic function is mildly impaired with an elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13). Potential etiologies of the cirrhosis include alcoholic, autoimmune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or [Last Name (un) 12611] disease. An elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level is concerning for malignancy, although no evidence of mass was found on ultrasound.

The patient is also experiencing shortness of breath, likely multifactorial in nature."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent a TIPS procedure and was subsequently intubated. He required low-dose neomycin due to sedation overnight and was found to have some old clotted blood.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3째C (99.1째F), heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/43-142/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 58.

On physical examination, the patient appears not to be in acute distress. His eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat are normal. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and he has bilateral lower extremity edema measuring 3+. Neurologic examination shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and has normal movement and tone. 

Laboratory results include a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 241 K/uL, platelet count of 216 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 216"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and 3 nights ago episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with slowly downtrending hematocrit.
   Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS procedure.
   - NPO for now
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - d/c Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (no
   course yet set)
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - patient successfully extubated [**2107-3-3**] now on face tent
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   - RUQ ultrasound today to assess TIPS patency
   - marked transaminitis noted [**3-3**] likely due to TIPS procedure.
   Monitor LFTs daily.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 145 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - trend sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], increased to peak of 1.6, now
   downtrending.  Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative
   eosinophils.  Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in
   TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Restart Lasix as tolerated
   - trend creatinine daily
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**] to 27 now returned to 10. ? Possible infectious
   etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now 129. Likely related to cirrhosis/splenic
   sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recurrent variceal bleeding. He underwent a TIPS procedure on [**3-2**].
- The patient presented with a new episode of BRBPR (blood-tinged vomit and hematemesis) on [**2107-3-2**], which was concerning for an upper gastrointestinal bleed. He has been intermittently producing maroon stools.
- The patient required intubation for the TIPS procedure and had a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation. A bedside bronchoscopy revealed fresh blood and edema around the vocal cords, likely due to traumatic intubation attempts.
- The patient was successfully extubated on [**2107-3-3**] and is now on a face tent.
- The patient's liver function tests show evidence of impaired synthetic function with an elevated INR and low albumin. A potential etiology for the cirrhosis includes alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or NASH. Elevated AFP could be concerning for malignancy, although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
- The patient has peripheral edema in the setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, and mild pulmonary ed"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recent TIPS procedure. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure requiring intubation, liver cirrhosis, peripheral edema, hypoalbuminemia, and possible contrast nephropathy. The patient's current condition includes confusion, erythematous left arm, tachycardia, hypertension, hypoxemia, and hypernatremia. He is currently extubated and receiving supplemental oxygen through a face tent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had multiple episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and further complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure during the TIPS procedure and had a difficult airway. There is a possibility of prolonged ventilation or repeated intubation attempts leading to vocal cord edema and potential long-term respiratory issues.
3. Liver cirrhosis: The patient has evidence of portal hypertension, which increases the risk of variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Contrast nephropathy: The patient received a significant amount of contrast dye during the TIPS procedure, which can cause acute kidney injury or contrast nephropathy.
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infectious process."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and 3 nights ago episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with slowly downtrending hematocrit.
   Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS procedure.
   - Advance diet as tolerated (sips)
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - d/c Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (day 1 =
   [**2-28**] for empiric 5 day course to end [**3-5**])
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - patient successfully extubated [**2107-3-3**] now on face tent for
   humidification and oxygenation
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - Start lactulose
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   - RUQ ultrasound today to assess TIPS patency
   - marked transaminitis noted [**3-3**] likely due to TIPS procedure and/or
   shock liver.  Monitor LFTs daily; follow-up with liver team.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 145 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - trend sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], increased to peak of 1.6, now
   downtrending.  Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative
   eosinophils.  Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in
   TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Lasix as tolerated
   - trend creatinine daily
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**] to 27 now returned to 10. ? Possible infectious
   etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now 129. Likely related to cirrhosis/splenic
   sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count daily
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recent TIPS procedure. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which was initially thought to be caused by esophageal varices but later found to be from gastric varices. The patient has been stabilized and is now extubated. He remains confused and has a marked erythema on his left forearm. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he has evidence of fresh blood and edema around the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts. His liver function tests show elevated INR and low albumin, indicating impaired synthetic function and potential etiologies such as alcoholic, autoimmune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or liver disease. Elevated AFP could be concerning for malignancy, although no evidence of mass on ultrasound. The patient also has shortness of breath likely due to volume overload, peripheral edema, and mild pulmonary edema on imaging. He has hypernatremia due to decreased access to free water in the setting of NPO status, acute renal failure possibly due to contrast nephropathy, increased WBC count suggesting an infectious etiology, thrombocytopenia likely related to cirrhosis/splenic sequestration, hypothyroidism, and a thyroid nodule. The patient's current plan includes advancing diet as tolerated, monitoring HCT and transfusing for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25, discontinuing octreotide, continuing ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in the setting of GI bleed, holding nadolol in the setting of active GI bleed, and following up with hepatology recommendations. The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."
