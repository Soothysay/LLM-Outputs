   CHIEF COMPLAINT: weakness, ankle swelling
   24 Hour Events:
   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:69 yo m with hx of systolic [**Last Name (LF) 7132**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   15-20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p MVR and tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring and
   PAF for which he is on coumadin and ITP who presents with increased
   weakness and difficulty ambulating due to left ankle pain. He has had
   multiple admissions recently, one from [**3-12**]- [**3-15**] for heart failure
   exacerbation at which time he had been started on spironolactone 25
   daily and his lasix dose increased from 60 to 80, and then again
   [**2072-3-18**]  due to misinterpretation of med dosing instructions, he was
   taking two 5mg tabs daily instead of two (2.5mg) tabs. At time of dc
   his INR was 2.4 and he was dc'd on stable dose of 5mg coumadin. He was
   also noted to be hypovolemic and hypernatremic with Cr 2.1 from
   baseline 1.0-1.4 and his lasix and aldactone were initially stopped
   then restarted at 40 and 235 respectively on [**2154-3-25**].  Three days prior
   to this admission he had noted progressive dyspnea on exertion and
   weakness as well as ankle pain,as well as increased swelling in his
   ankles and abdomen, but what was most bothersome to him was his pain in
   his left ankle on ambulation which was limiting his mobility and so he
   presented to the ED on [**2154-3-29**] where he was noted to be in afib and
   volume overloaded on exam with BNP elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 11793**] from 7201 and INR
   elevated to 20 with no evidence bleeding and he was reversed with
   vitamin K. He was also found to be in acute on chronic renal failure
   with Cr 2.2 from baseline He had a CXR showing mild pulmonary vascular
   congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions and a retrocardiac
   opacity likely represents atelectasis, although underlying infection
   cannot be excluded. Foot x-ray was negative for fx with evaluation by
   ortho with diagnosis of cellulitis with hematoma for which he was
   started on vanc/ceftaz. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 98 bpm with
   LVH, intraventricular conduction delay and overall no changes from
   prior.
   .
   He was diuresed with lasix IV 20 in ED and  then continued to receive
   IV boluses on [**Hospital1 2259**] and was diuresed with lasix boluses (40mg IV BID)
   then subsequently changed to lasix drip yesterday, limited by systolic
   bp's 80-90s with his baseline around 90 with I/O even unable to get
   negative. His Cr was also creeping up, from and eventually started on
   milrinone drip on the floor and subsequently transfered to the ICU for
   ionotrope assisted diuresis.
   He had been on lisinopril 5 as o/p which was titrated down over course
   of weekend and dc'd on day of ICU admission.
   His INR was 1.8 after being reversed with vit K and was started on
   heparin bridge, but on day of ICU transfer he was noteed to have nose
   bleed and INR at 2.6 so hep dc'd.
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies
   recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf
   pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
   paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,  palpitations, syncope or
   presyncope.
   .
   [**2154-4-1**]: Echo
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left
   atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
   echocardiography). The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
   moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis. The basal inferior
   and inferolateral wall is hypokinetic but moves best, the remaining
   segments are near akinetic (LVEF <20 %). The estimated cardiac index is
   depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe
   global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
   ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is
   present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet
   motion and transvalvular gradients. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
   [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-12-26**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
   Biventricular cavity size is now increased with similar systolic
   function.
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which
   the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibotor or
   [**Last Name (un) 239**].
   .
   Echo ([**2153-9-5**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium
   is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). The
   estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). The right
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
   aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
   is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
   leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] A tricuspid valve annuloplasty
   ring is present. The tricuspid annuloplasty ring appears well seated
   and is not obstructing flow. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Dilated right
   ventricle with moderate systolic dysfunction and evidence of
   pressure/volume overload. Normally-functioning mitral valve
   bioprosthesis. Tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring with moderate residual
   central regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

   CARDIAC CATH: [**2151-10-12**]:
   1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
   demonstrated severe native 3-vessel disease. The LMCA was 90% occluded.
   The LAD was totally occluded proximally; the distal LAD filled via a
   patent LIMA graft. The LCX was totally occluded proximally; OM1 filled
   via an SVG; the sequential graft from OM1 to OM2 was occluded, but
   OM2 filled via a robust epicardial collateral. The RCA was totally
   occluded proximally; the distal vessel filled via left-to-right
   collaterals from the grafted LAD.
   2. Selective graft angiography showed a patent SVG to OM1; the jump
   segment to OM2 was occluded, but OM2 filled via an epicardial
   collateral. The SVG to RPDA was totally occulded. The LIMA to LAD was
   widely patent.
   3. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated biventricular
   filling
   pressures with moderate pulmonary hypertension and reduced cardiac
   index. There were large V-waves on the RA tracing consistent with
   severe
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   4. Aortography showed a heavily calcified ascending aorta.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe mitral regurgitation.
   3. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.

   fluid restriction. Notes that he has eaten soup with low sodium over
   the past couple of days, so salt intact can be a precipitant. Has low
   LVEF of 15-20% on last echo. On his last hospital discharge, his weight
   was 164.6 pounds. BNP elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 11793**] (last one: 7201).

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve ring placement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with symptoms of increased weakness, difficulty ambulating due to left ankle pain, and ankle swelling. His past medical history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. He also has severe tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. The patient's current medications include nitroglycerin, aspirin, atorvastatin, calcium, cholecalciferol, warfarin, lasix, and aldactone.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure: The patient has fluid overload, especially in the lower extremities. He is compliant with his lasix and aldactone, but his weight has not increased. His BNP is elevated. He should continue with strict intake and output measurements, daily weight monitoring, and dietary salt restriction.
2. Coagulopathy/microcytic anemia: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR of 20 on admission, which has been reversed with vitamin K. He has a history of nose bleeding, and his hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume are low. He should be discharged on coumadin 2.5 mg and held from aspirin. Critical checks and gastrointestinal bleeding should be monitored.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient presented with a creatinine of 2.2. His new baseline since [**3-20**] has been 2.0-2.2 from 1.2 previously. He should have urine electrolyte testing and strict intake and output measurements. Nephrotoxins should be avoided, and aldactone should be held.
4. Bioprosthetic mitral valve: The patient has a bioprosthetic mitral valve and needs anticoagulation with an INR goal of 2.0-3.
5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, and his heart rate is currently within normal limits. He should continue to be monitored on telemetry, and metoprolol should be held due to hypotension.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, likely due to low intravascular volume and congestive heart failure. He should continue to be trended.
7. Hypertension: The patient is currently hypotensive. Lisinopril and metoprolol should be held for now.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient should continue with his atorvastatin medication.
9. Diet: The patient should follow a low-salt, cardiac heart-healthy diet.
10. Peripheral intravenous (PIV) line: The patient has a 20-gauge PIV line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure symptoms: The patient's symptoms of weakness, difficulty ambulating, and ankle swelling suggest worsening heart failure. Close monitoring and appropriate diuretic therapy should be continued.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and history of nose bleeding indicate a risk for bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate anticoagulation management is essential.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and history of chronic kidney disease suggest a risk for AKI. Strict intake and output measurements, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and appropriate management of fluid balance are important.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and immobilization due to illness increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) should be considered.
5. Infection: The patient's history of cellulitis and presence of a PIV line increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if indicated."

   ICU Care
","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with evidence of volume overload and an acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure. They have a history of cellulitis in their left lower extremity, acute on chronic renal failure, and transaminitis likely due to hepatic congestion. The patient also has hyperkalemia, which may be due to lisinopril or renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient has an acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if fluid balance is not managed appropriately.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function if not carefully monitored and managed.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a potassium level of 4.8, indicating hyperkalemia. This could potentially lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications if not managed properly.
4. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis in their left lower extremity, which needs to be treated and monitored to prevent the spread of infection.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which may be due to hepatic congestion. It is important to monitor liver function and prevent further liver damage.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their heart failure, renal function, electrolyte imbalances, infection, and liver function."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute exacerbation of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) on chronic, cellulitis in the left lower extremity (LLE), acute on chronic renal failure, and transaminitis. 

The patient presented with evidence of volume overload worsened by a possible dietary salt load. Despite being compliant with lasix/aldactone therapy and fluid restriction, the patient was unable to tolerate a lasix bolus/drip due to persistent asymptomatic hypotension. Therefore, a lasix drip was continued overnight, and urine output was monitored. 

The patient's blood pressure remained in the 90s systolic, so it was decided to add milrinone to maintain blood pressure while uptitrating the diuretic. If hypotension persisted with milrinone, low-dose phenylephrine was considered. Lisinopril was restarted on admission but was down-titrated and discontinued today due to hypotension, with only 5mg given in the unit. The patient's creatinine improved from 2.2 to 1.7.

The plan moving forward includes continuing the lasix drip at 5-15mg/hr with hospital-specific electrolytes, daily weights, strict input/output goals targeting a negative 1L/day fluid balance, and fluid restriction to less than 2L/day. The patient's beta-blockers were held due"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. The patient presented with evidence of volume overload, worsened by a possible dietary salt load. The patient is compliant with lasix/aldactone therapy and fluid restriction but was unable to tolerate diuretics on the floor due to persistent asymptomatic hypotension. The patient's blood pressure is currently being maintained in the low 90s with the use of a lasix drip. The patient's urine output was 140cc/hr with a net negative 1.5L, and their heart rate is stable at 82 bpm.

The patient also has cellulitis in the left lower extremity, for which they are being treated with antibiotics and elevation. The patient can bear weight on the affected leg. Additionally, the patient has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.2 that improved to 1.6 today. This may be related to the use of lasix or pre-renal issues if the patient has low ejection fraction.

The patient also has transaminitis, likely due to hepatic congestion, with trending down liver function tests from ALT/AST 84/138 to 75/115 today, and now at 48/92. The patient has atrial fibrillation with a mechanical valve and is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient's INR is 2.3, and the goal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure, likely due to volume overload and dietary salt load. The patient is tolerating a lasix drip at 15 mg/hr, which has resulted in a net negative fluid balance of 1.5 L over the past 24 hours. His blood pressure remains stable in the low 90s. Other notable conditions include cellulitis in the left lower extremity, acute on chronic renal failure, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation with mitral valve regurgitation, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms of volume overload and persistent hypotension despite diuretic therapy indicate a potential worsening of heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance, blood pressure, and signs of congestion is necessary.
2. Cellulitis in the left lower extremity: The presence of warm, erythematous skin at the site of presumed cellulitis suggests an infection. It is crucial to monitor for any progression of symptoms, such as increasing pain, swelling, or systemic signs of infection.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. Frequent monitoring of renal function markers, such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), will help assess the progression of renal failure and guide management decisions.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. 

1. Acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure: The patient has evidence of volume overload and worsened in the setting of a possible dietary salt load. They are compliant with Lasix/Aldactone therapy and fluid restriction but were unable to diurese on the floor due to persistent asymptomatic hypotension. They will continue with the Lasix drip overnight, and if unable to meet the goal diuresis, milrinone will be added to maintain blood pressure while uptitrating the diuretic. If hypotension occurs with milrinone, low-dose phenylephrine can be started.

2. Cellulitis of the left lower extremity: The patient has cellulitis at the site of presumed cellulitis, which is being followed by orthopedics. They are currently on ANC (ancef) and elevation. They can still bear weight, and follow-up with orthopedic recommendations will be continued.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient presented with a creatinine level of 2.2, higher than their baseline of 1.2. Currently, their creatinine level is still at 2.2. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of Lasix use and/or pre-renal if low ejection fraction (forward flow). Strict intake/output (I/O)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 72.5 kg male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure (systolic), and chronic kidney disease. They were admitted to the ICU due to acute decompensated heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/61 mmHg to 75/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving furosemide infusion for diuresis and has been given trazodone for sleep. The patient's allergies include confusion/delirium and beta-blockers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's current serum creatinine levels are elevated (2.0 mg/dL), indicating possible impaired kidney function. Additionally, the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease. Close monitoring of urine output and kidney function is necessary to prevent or identify AKI early.

2. Infection: The presence of cellulitis in the left mid shin, along with elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, suggests a possible infection. Proper wound care and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated to prevent further complications.

3. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure, likely due to volume overload and possible dietary salt load. The patient is compliant with Lasix and aldactone therapy, as well as fluid restriction. The patient's blood pressure is now tolerating Lasix gtt, h. Other issues include left lower extremity cellulitis, acute on chronic renal failure, and transaminitis. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with a mechanical valve and a previous transmural myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure: The patient's current condition suggests worsening of volume overload, which can lead to further deterioration of heart function and potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.
2. Left lower extremity cellulitis: This skin infection, if left untreated or inadequately treated, can progress to deeper tissue infections, systemic infection (sepsis), or even limb-threatening necrotizing fasciitis.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may worsen if not properly managed. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and accumulation of toxic substances in the body.
4. Transaminitis: Although trending down, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) suggest liver dysfunction. If not addressed, it may progress to more severe"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with evidence of volume overload, worsened by a possible dietary salt load.
- The patient is compliant with Lasix/Aldactone therapy and fluid restriction.
- Blood pressure has improved, and creatinine levels are also improving.
- Hyponatremia is resolving, along with congestion from edema/heart failure.
- Aggressive diuresis with Lasix will continue, along with weight checks.
- Lisinopril will be held for now and may be added back as blood pressure tolerates.
- Fluid restriction is to be maintained at less than 2 liters per day.
- No beta-blockers will be given due to severe asymptomatic bradycardia, and the patient does not desire an ICD.
- The patient has left lower extremity (LLE) pain due to edema and cellulitis. Ancef has been started, and elevation has been recommended. Ancef will be continued for another day, and the patient can bear weight.
- The patient presented with acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.2, higher than the baseline of 1.2. Creatinine has improved to 1.6 today. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from Lasix use and/or pre-renal azotemia if low ejection fraction (forward flow).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (sCHF), mitral valve replacement (MVR), and tricuspid ring, admitted to the hospital with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for ionotrope-assisted diuresis due to persistent hypotension. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/48 mmHg to 110/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on Furosemide (Lasix) infusion at 15 mg/hour and has been diuresed with Lasix gtt. The patient's input/output balance shows a negative fluid balance of 2,237 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination reveals an alert and oriented general appearance, with sclera anicteric and clear oropharynx. The neck is supple with no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cardiovascular examination shows a regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2, along with a loud systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border radiating to the carotids. The abdomen is soft, non-t"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, mitral valve replacement, and tricuspid ring. He was admitted to the hospital with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with lasix-driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU for ionotrope-assisted diuresis.

The patient has evidence of volume overload worsened by a possible dietary salt load. He is compliant with lasix/aldactone therapy and fluid restriction but was unable to tolerate lasix bolus/drip on the floor due to persistent asymptomatic hypotension. The patient is tolerating the lasix drip at 15 mg/hr, with a goal diuresis of >1L. His blood pressure is being maintained in the low 90s systolic, and he is asymptomatic.

The patient has a history of left lower extremity cellulitis, for which he received antibiotics and elevation. He can now bear weight. Additionally, the patient presented with acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.2 (higher than his baseline of 1.2). His creatinine has improved to 1.6 today. It is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of lasix use and/or pre-renal if low ejection fraction (forward flow).

The patient also had transaminitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (sCHF), mitral valve replacement (MVR), and tricuspid ring, admitted to the hospital with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure. The patient was initially treated with lasix-driven diuresis but limited by persistent hypotension. He was then transferred to the CCU for ionotrope-assisted diuresis. The patient has been compliant with lasix/aldactone therapy and fluid restriction but unable to tolerate diuretics on the floor due to persistent asymptomatic hypotension. The patient remains on lasix gtt with a goal of at least 1 L negative each day. His I/O is being closely monitored along with daily weights. Lisinopril is currently held, and fluid restriction is maintained at less than 2 L/day. The patient has cellulitis in the left lower extremity (LLE), which is being treated with antibiotics and elevation. His renal function has improved from a baseline creatinine of 1.2 to 1.4. The transaminitis seen on admission is likely due to hepatic congestion and is improving. The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) with a mechanical mitral valve and bioprosthetic valve/ring and is on Coumadin with an INR goal of 2-3. The patient's code status is full code,"
