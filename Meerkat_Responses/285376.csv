   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to
   mid inferior segments. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial

   [**2182-7-26**]: Cardiac MR
   Impression:
   1. Mildly increased left ventricular cavity size with mild global
   hypokinesis
   and mildly depressed LVEF of 45%. No MR evidence of prior myocardial
   scarring/infarction.
   2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF was
   normal at
   48%.
   3. No aortic regurgitation. No mitral regurgitation.
   4. The indexed diameters of the ascending aorta, arch, and descending
   thoracic
   aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
   5. Mild biatrial enlargement
   6. Normal coronary artery origins with no evidence of anomalous
   coronary
   arteries. The left main coronary artery had moderate signal attenuation
   consistent with moderate distal disease. The mid LAD had marked signal
   attenuation consistent with significant disease. The RCA and LCX
   appeared to
   have normal signal characteristics in the visualized segments.
   7. No evidence of pericardial constriction found.
   8. A note is made of a small pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural
   effusions, and atelectasis.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 52 yo male with hx of AML, now day +141 s/p cord blood
   transplant hosp course c/b hypoxic resp failure requiring intubation
   possibly [**2-14**] to cyclosporine tox and ARRDS who initially improved but
   has become increasingly hypoxic on the BMT floor
   Hypoxic resp failure:  Patient has intermittent hypoxia over the past
   week generally responsive to lasix. Differential includes Pulmonary
   process versus cardiac process, and most likely a combination.
   Given history of ARDs (?rare cylcosporine toxicity) early in [**Month (only) **], he
   may have post ARDS fibrosis. But since the hypoxia is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**]
   and responsive to lasix, leans more towards cardiac process.  f He did
   have a Cardiac MR in [**2180**] that showed significant mid LAD stenosis and
   moderate left main stenosis. he could have intermittent ischemia from
   underlying coronary disease, flash pulm edema from diastolic HF.  He
   could be flicking emboli, or have papillary dysfunction from silent
   infacard. This could be coronary spasm. Also in the pulmonary
   differential given CT scan and lung exam, given the relative acuity of
   these desats, he could have [**Last Name (un) 1931**] [**Doctor First Name **], or some sort of pulmonary
   fibrosis. Infections etiologies should also be considered. bacterial
   less likely given no leukocytosis or fever. should consider fungal
   infection given history of invasive aspirgilosis -- ABPA, CNPA,
   aspirgiloma. acute eosinpohilc PNA.
   echo trend -- mild lv dysfunction. mild rv dysfunction. EF increasing
   from [**2182**]. 40-45 --> 50-55.
   - continue to diurese, goal negative 1L
   - f/u cardiology consult for consideration of a left heart cath, and ?
   rt heart
   - continue on face mask and try to wean as tolerated
   - continue around the clock nebs.
   - BMT team requesting swan to measure wedge pressures and pulm artery
   pressures, he may not tolerate this, can first try diuretic trial to
   see if this improves respiratory status
   - for pulmonary diagnosis, fibrosis may be steroid dependent or
   independent. One option is to do steroid trial, although would defer
   while actively diuresing him, since it will be hard to tease out what
   is improving him. He did improve yesterday, but he got diuresed and 100
   of methylprenisone in the AM as well
   - ultimately would need VATS to make a tissue diagnosis, but will
   currently defer, since he is improving and would need to be intubated
   for this.
   # ID: He has been afebrile for past week and no positive cx data to
   date except for rare coag neg staph from one nasal swab.
   - recycle galactomannan and B-glucan, f/u previous
   - CT showed possible sinusitis & multifocal PNA. ENT did middle meatal
   cultures but they came back negative. If spikes a temp, will need to
   consider sinuses as well as other more common sites of infection
   - would continue levaquin for now, but if spikes, would cover broadly
   for HAP with Cefepime/Vanc/Levo. Of note, he has had a possible hx of
   drug fever to meropenam
   # AML
   - Cyclosporin was switched to Tacrolimus on [**2184-3-31**]
   - continue tacrolimus and cellcept
   - continue acyclovir, voriconazole, atrovaquone PPx
   - will need to clarify with BMT why he is on atovaquone as no hx of
   sulfa allergy
   # ARF: baseline cre 1.3-1.5. During recent [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] course had ARF [**2-14**] ATN
   and prerenal. This has since resolved and current creatinine is the
   best it has been.
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline levels of around 50 throughout
   hospitalziation.
   - goal plts >20 unless actively bleeding

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), who underwent a cord blood transplant and is currently hospitalized with hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been experiencing intermittent hypoxia over the past week, which has been partially responsive to diuretic therapy. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary processes versus cardiac processes, with a combination of both being more likely. 

There is a history of ARDS and possible cyclosporine toxicity early on. The patient may have post-ARDS fibrosis, but the hypoxia is responsive to diuretics, suggesting a cardiac process. He had a cardiac MRI in [date] that showed significant mid left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis and moderate left main coronary artery stenosis. 

He could have intermittent ischemia from underlying coronary disease, flash pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure, or embolic phenomena. Other possibilities include coronary spasm, pulmonary fibrosis, or infections such as fungal infection given the history of invasive aspergillosis.

An echocardiogram trend shows mild left ventricular dysfunction and mild right ventricular dysfunction, with an ejection fraction (EF) increasing from 40-45% to 50-55%. 

The plan includes continuing diuretic therapy, consulting cardiology for consideration of left heart catheterization, and possibly right heart catheterization. The patient will also be weaned off face mask oxygen as tolerated"

   while actively diuresing him, since it will be hard to tease out what
   is improving him. He did improve yesterday, but he got diuresed and 100
   of methylprenisone in the AM as well
   - ultimately would need VATS to make a tissue diagnosis, but will
   currently defer, since he is improving and would need to be intubated
   for this.
   ID: He has been afebrile for past week and no positive cx data to date
   except for rare coag neg staph from one nasal swab.
   - recycle galactomannan and B-glucan, f/u previous
   - CT showed possible sinusitis & multifocal PNA. ENT did middle meatal
   cultures but they came back negative. If spikes a temp, will need to
   consider sinuses as well as other more common sites of infection
   - would continue levaquin for now, but if spikes, would cover broadly
   for HAP with Cefepime/Vanc/Levo. Of note, he has had a possible hx of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a cord blood transplant and is currently hospitalized with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient initially improved but has become increasingly hypoxic on the BMT floor. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary process, cardiac process, or a combination of both. The patient's history of ARDS, possible cyclosporine toxicity, and fibrosis suggests post-ARDS fibrosis as a possible cause. However, given the waxing and waning nature of the hypoxia and responsiveness to diuretics, a cardiac process is more likely. The patient also has a history of significant mid left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis and moderate left main coronary artery stenosis. Other potential causes of the hypoxia include coronary spasm, papillary muscle dysfunction from silent infarction, or embolic events. Infections, particularly fungal infections such as invasive aspergillosis, ABPA, CNPA, or aspirgiloma, should also be considered. The patient's echocardiogram shows mild left ventricular dysfunction and mild right ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction increasing from 40-45% to 50-55%. The patient's current plan includes continued diuresis, cardiology consultation for consideration of a left heart catheterization, and weaning off face mask as tolerated."

   Imaging: [**4-12**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
   wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to
   mid inferior segments. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-4-2**], images
   are more limited. The pericardial effusion may be slightly smaller. The
   other findings are similar.
   [**2182-7-26**]: Cardiac MR
   Impression:
   1. Mildly increased left ventricular cavity size with mild global
   hypokinesis
   and mildly depressed LVEF of 45%. No MR evidence of prior myocardial
   scarring/infarction.
   2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF was
   normal at
   48%.
   3. No aortic regurgitation. No mitral regurgitation.
   4. The indexed diameters of the ascending aorta, arch, and descending
   thoracic
   aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
   5. Mild biatrial enlargement
   6. Normal coronary artery origins with no evidence of anomalous
   coronary
   arteries. The left main coronary artery had moderate signal attenuation
   consistent with moderate distal disease. The mid LAD had marked signal
   attenuation consistent with significant disease. The RCA and LCX
   appeared to
   have normal signal characteristics in the visualized segments.
   7. No evidence of pericardial constriction found.
   8. A note is made of a small pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural
   effusions, and atelectasis.

   process versus cardiac process, and most likely a combination.
   Given history of ARDs (?rare cylcosporine toxicity) early in [**Month (only) **], he
   may have post ARDS fibrosis. But since the hypoxia is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**]
   and responsive to lasix, leans more towards cardiac process.  f He did
   have a Cardiac MR in [**2180**] that showed significant mid LAD stenosis and
   moderate left main stenosis. he could have intermittent ischemia from
   underlying coronary disease, flash pulm edema from diastolic HF.  He
   could be flicking emboli, or have papillary dysfunction from silent
   infacard. This could be coronary spasm. Also in the pulmonary
   differential given CT scan and lung exam, given the relative acuity of
   these desats, he could have [**Last Name (un) 1931**] [**Doctor First Name **], or some sort of pulmonary

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a cord blood transplant and is currently hospitalized for hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been experiencing intermittent hypoxia and is responding to lasix. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary processes such as pulmonary fibrosis, post-ARDS, sarcoidosis, eosinophilic lung disease, and cardiac processes. The patient is also suspected to have strongyloidiasis, for which prophylaxis with atovaquone has been started. His cardiac medication regimen has been optimized, and he is awaiting stress testing. The patient's platelet count remains low, and he has resolved acute kidney injury (ARF) with baseline creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 1.5.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's intermittent hypoxia requires close monitoring and management. Oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation may be necessary if the patient's condition deteriorates.
2. Pulmonary processes: Given the patchy bilateral pulmonary opacifications seen on the chest X-ray, the patient is at risk of developing further pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Monitoring of respiratory symptoms and serial chest X-rays is important.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of anginal episodes and the possibility of cardiac involvement in his hypoxic respiratory failure need to be considered. Close monitoring of cardiac symptoms and optimization of cardiac medication are essential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He is currently in the hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which initially improved but has now become increasingly hypoxic. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary process: Given the patient's symptoms of respiratory distress and ARDS, there is a possibility of ongoing lung damage or infection. Further evaluation and treatment will be necessary to manage any pulmonary complications.

2. Cardiac process: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure could also be related to a cardiac issue. It is important to monitor his cardiac function and consider any necessary interventions to improve cardiac output.

3. Strongyloides infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to the AML and cord blood transplant makes him susceptible to opportunistic infections like Strongyloides. Diagnostic tests are being conducted to confirm the presence of this infection.

4. Drug fever: The patient has a possible history of drug fever to meropenem, which should be taken into consideration when selecting antibiotics for treatment.

   ain,
   There are low lung volumes with patchy bilateral pulmonary opacificatio

   especially in the lower lung zone.  Again, this could reflect ARDS, mul
   tifocal
   pneumonia, or some element of pulmonary vascular congestion.

   possibly [**2-14**] to cyclosporine tox and ARRDS who initially improved but
   has become increasingly hypoxic on the BMT floor.
    # Hypoxic resp failure:  Patient has intermittent hypoxia over the
   past week generally responsive to lasix. Differential includes
   Pulmonary process versus cardiac process, and most likely a
   combination.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a cord blood transplant and has been hospitalized with hypoxic respiratory failure. He initially improved but has now become increasingly hypoxic. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has a background of AML and received a cord blood transplant, which was complicated by cyclosporine toxicity and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, ARDS, and possible strongyloidiasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Process: Given the patient's history of ARDS and current hypoxic respiratory failure, there is a risk of further pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or worsening ARDS.
2. Cardiac Process: The patient's intermittent hypoxia could be due to a cardiac process, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Strongyloidiasis: The patient has a possible strongyloidiasis infection, which can cause severe respiratory symptoms and disseminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.
4. Drug Fever: The patient has had a possible history of drug fever to meropenem, indicating the need for careful consideration of antibiotic choices.
5. Sinusitis and Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has a CT scan showing possible sinusitis and multifocal pneumonia, which should be monitored and treated appropriately.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient"

   - continue around the clock nebs.
   - for the next 2 days will diurese him and assess  improvement. If
   worsens, will certainly start steroids. After trial of pure diuresis
   only (will tolerate creatinine bump) would rescan chest. If no change,
   will try on trial of steroids given peripheral eosoniphila suggestiong
   of eosinophilc PNA and CT, if uncahged, as well as lung exam.
   - ultimately would need VATS to make a tissue diagnosis, but will

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant and is currently hospitalized in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is hypoxia. 

The patient's medical history includes hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to cyclosporine toxicity and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient initially improved but has become increasingly hypoxic on the bone marrow transplant (BMT) floor. 

The assessment and plan include optimizing the patient's medication regimen, conducting an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function, and considering a left heart catheterization or dobutamine stress MIBI. The patient is being diuresed, nebulized, and weaned off mechanical ventilation as tolerated. 

The patient also has eosinophilia suggesting possible eosinophilic pneumonia (PNA), and a CT scan of the chest is recommended if there is no improvement. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may be considered for tissue diagnosis, but it will be deferred for now. 

In terms of infection, the patient has been afebrile for the past week with no positive cultures except for a rare coag-negative Staphylococcus from one nasal swab. The patient is on prophylaxis with acyclovir, voriconazole, and atovaquone. 

The patient's renal function has improved, and thromboc"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications including antibiotics, antifungal agents, and other supportive care measures.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/76 mmHg to 140/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an aerosol-cool device.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, which have improved slightly, and the patient's extremities are absent on the right side. The neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, has purposeful movement, normal tone, and a slight tremor.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 8.1 g/dL, elevated potassium levels at 5.4 mEq/L, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 38 mg/dL, and a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulceration, and nosocomial infections due"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old male with AML s/p myeloablative unrelated cord blood
   transplant now approximately day +150.  He comes to the ICU with
   dyspnea, hypoxemia, and radiographic infiltrates.  These have both an
   acute, episodic component and a more subacute component.
   He seems to have worsened overnight
 his O2 requirement is going up
   and he looks a little more distressed to me.  Interestingly, he says
   his orthopnea is better.
   He was also discovered today to have been receiving the incorrect
   tacrolimus tablets
 5mg instead of 0.5mg. This appears to have been a
   dispensing issue rather than an order issue. Discussed with patient.
   Will check tacro level and hold dosese for now.
   The episodic, intermittent component appears to be related to coronary
   arterial disease with transient LV diastolic dysfunction.  We have made
   good progress in rate/pressure control and diuresis, and I think we are
   close to having optimized him here.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to add nitrates if
   symptoms recur.  Continues on aspirin (every other day per BMT) and
   metoprolol.  Off of ACEI for now since we are optimizing rate control.
   For the more chronic component, he seems to be worsening.  Please see
   my note from yesterday regarding the differential diagnosis, which
   includes BOOP/COP, AEP/CEP, sarcoid, and even pulmonary-renal
   syndromes, as well as others.
   Given that he appears worse in spite of better cardiac control, we will
   pursue noncontrast CT imaging today to evaluate for changes.  Suspect
   that we should pursue empiric steroids at this point.
   We
ll continue his current GVHD regimen, except that we
ll hold
   tacrolimus while the level is drawn (and presumably falls).
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note.

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   2pm
   CT was quite helpful.  Parenchymal disease has clearly worsened, with
   an overall more peripheral and generally peribronchial distribution.
   Bases are more confluent.  This is fairly suggesting of cryptogenic
   organizing pneumonia.  Certainly other things (CEP, even Wegener
   etc.) remain in the radiographic differential.  There
s no clinical
   evidence for infection at this point.  Stool O&P is ordered (for
   Strongyloides) but he has not moved his bowels yet.
   We will treat with empiric steroids at this point
 Solumedrol 125mg IV
   q 6 hours for a few days, then taper.  We chose this dose because he
   has fairly rapidly progressive and quite severe disease.  Although we
   would often recommend biopsy, I would not do so in this case because of
   his unrevascularized, known LM/LAD CAD and his tenuous oxygenation
   status.
   Discussed with patient, wife, and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplant. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and radiographic infiltrates. The patient's symptoms have both an acute and subacute component.

The acute component appears to be related to coronary arterial disease with transient left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The medical team has made progress in rate/pressure control and diuresis.

The subacute component suggests a worsening condition, and the differential diagnosis includes bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome (COP), acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP)/chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP), sarcoidosis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, and others. Noncontrast CT imaging has been ordered to evaluate for changes.

Due to the patient's worsening condition despite better cardiac control, empiric steroids have been initiated to treat cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The patient will receive Solumedrol 125mg IV every 6 hours for a few days, then taper.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Coronary arterial disease with transient LV diastolic dysfunction: This condition can lead to further cardiac complications such as myocardial ischemia or infarction, arrhythmias, and heart failure.

2. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP): COP is"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a cord blood transplant 143 days ago. He was readmitted to the hospital due to increasing hypoxemia. The patient has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), a lung condition commonly seen in transplant patients. He was started on methylprednisolone, an anti-inflammatory medication.

The patient also presented with enterococci urinary tract infection (UTI), for which repeat urine culture and sensitivity testing is pending. His cardiovascular status is stable, and he is being managed with medications to control blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's renal function has shown a slight decline, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL (baseline 1.3-1.5 mg/dL). Consideration is being given to reducing the dosage of diuretic medication (furosemide) due to worsening renal function.

The patient's immunosuppressive therapy, including tacrolimus, has been adjusted. Tacrolimus levels are being monitored closely, and the patient is also on prophylactic antibiotics and antiviral medications. The patient's platelet count is stable, and transfusion of platelets is recommended only if the count falls below 20,000 or if active bleeding occurs.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and BO"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), day +143 post cord blood transplant, and previously readmitted due to worsening hypoxemia. The patient is currently being treated for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with methylprednisolone. The patient's urinary tract infection (UTI) with enterococci is still pending repeat urine analysis and culture before starting vancomycin. The patient's chest pain has resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and nitro paste, without any EKG changes, and arterial blood gas (ABG) is normal while on supplemental oxygen. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxemia, which is leading to hypoxic respiratory failure. This could be due to the underlying ARDS, BOOP, or possible cardiogenic component.
2. CV (cardiovascular) issues: The patient is likely to have unstable angina, as indicated by the chest pain. Medical management includes metoprolol and ASA 81mg PO QOD. Nitro paste has been applied, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be considered if chest pain persists or worsens.
3. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from baseline, indicating acute renal failure. Possible causes include nephritis, and tests such as anti"

He presents to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and radiographic infiltrates. The patient is being treated for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and is on high-dose steroids. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may persist or worsen if the underlying cause is not adequately addressed. This could potentially lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. BOOP: While the patient is receiving treatment for BOOP, there is no significant improvement observed. It is important to closely monitor the response to therapy and adjust treatment if necessary.
3. GVHD: There is a possibility of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) contributing to the patient's symptoms. Monitoring for signs of GVHD and managing accordingly is crucial.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), which may contribute to his current symptoms. Cardiac input and monitoring are essential to manage any cardiovascular complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's BUN/Cr levels indicate renal impairment. Ongoing monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplant. He is currently in the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and radiographic infiltrates. The patient is being treated for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with high-dose steroids. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/89 to 115/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and is on NIPPV for work of breathing. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 62 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 mg/dL. The patient also has elevated blood glucose levels, ranging from 299 to 278 mg/dL. Other lab results include abnormal liver function tests, such as elevated AST and ALT levels, and electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium and magnesium levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who is day +143 post cord blood transplant. He was readmitted to the hospital due to increasing hypoxemia and was diagnosed with Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP), likely secondary to cyclosporine use.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia and is receiving CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy. A trial of CPAP with auto settings overnight was initiated.
- Coronary artery disease: The patient has chest discomfort and is being managed with medical therapy, including metoprolol, aspirin, and nitro paste. The possibility of unstable angina or a gastrointestinal component is also considered.
- Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating worsening renal function. Autodiuresis is being allowed, and the use of ACE inhibitors is held due to potential interaction with tacrolimus.
- Infection: The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for herpes simplex virus (SHV), fungal infection, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). A repeat urine culture is pending, and additional tests are being conducted to rule out any ongoing infections.
- Endocrine issues: The patient requires increased insulin dosage due to the effects of corticosteroids. Baseline"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently on day +143 post cord blood transplant. He has been readmitted to the hospital due to increasing hypoxemia and is diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, cardiovascular issues, infectious disease concerns, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing and low oxygen levels, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of unstable angina with no EKG changes. This suggests possible ongoing ischemia in the heart. If left untreated, it can lead to myocardial infarction or other cardiac complications.

3. Infections: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals due to his immunocompromised state. There is a concern for possible infections like strongyloides, enterococcus UTI, or viral infections. If these infections are not appropriately managed, they can worsen the patient's condition.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to various factors such as medications, dehydration, or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplant. He is currently in the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and radiographic infiltrates, and is being treated for Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP). 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/68 to 143/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG result of ///26/. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, a soft and non-tender abdomen, extremities with 1+ edema, and an inability to stand due to back pain. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and has purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 2.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL, platelet count of 62 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 26 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 278 to 334 mg/dL. Other lab values such as electrolytes, lactate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplant approximately 150 days ago. He was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and radiographic infiltrates, and is currently being treated for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to BOOP, possibly graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). He is receiving high-dose steroids for BOOP and is also on NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) for increased work of breathing. The patient has a history of OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and will be trialing BiPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) tonight.

The patient's infection workup includes ruling out strongyloides with ova and parasites (O&P) pending, as well as enterococcus in the urine. A repeat urine analysis and culture is pending. The patient's cardiovascular status is being monitored closely, with goals of rising BUN/Cr (blood urea nitrogen/creatinine) levels and continuing metoprolol, nitro paste, and daily ECGs. The patient is also on aspirin (ASA) once daily, and cardiology input is appreciated due to concerns about increased myocardial demand and poor reserve. Bi"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a cord blood transplant on day +144. He was readmitted due to increasing hypoxemia and diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with possible cardiogenic component. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications and comorbidities.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109-136/68-82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and plans:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has been weaned off oxygen and started on methylprednisolone to manage BOOP. Strongyloides prophylaxis is also being given to prevent hyperstrongyloidosis syndrome.
2. Cardiac concerns: The patient has a history of unstable angina and is on medical management with aspirin and metoprolol. Nitro paste has been applied, and further rate control is being discussed.
3. Renal function: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, so autodiuresis is allowed while holding ACE inhibitors due to their interaction with tacrolimus and potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemia caused by bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, possible unstable angina, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia. He is receiving various treatments and prophylaxis measures. His vital signs and lab results are being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia may lead to further deterioration in respiratory function, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Unstable angina: The patient's ischemic symptoms could progress to myocardial infarction or ongoing chest pain.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, which may worsen and require dialysis.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high insulin requirements with steroid use may lead to hyperglycemia, potentially causing complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia when adjusting insulin doses.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if invasive procedures are required.

Note: The patient's medical history and current condition suggest potential complications related to his underlying AML, cord blood transplant, and associated immun"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is currently on day +144 post cord blood transplant. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing hypoxemia and diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's main concerns include hypoxic respiratory failure, cardiovascular issues, infectious diseases, endocrine disorders, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has been weaned off oxygen and is currently on a nasal mask with NC. He did not tolerate CPAP overnight but tolerated nasal biPAP. His vital signs show a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/82 mmHg to 149/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.3°C. His oxygen saturation is at 100%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count of 62 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 300 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient has been tested negative for Strongyloides O+P and has a positive urine culture for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE).

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52M h/o AML, day +148 s/p cord blood transplant,
   c/b ARDS [**2-14**] cyclosporine, readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] given increasing
   hypoxemia [**2-14**] BOOP.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Likely [**2-14**] BOOP with possible cardiogenic component.  O2 weaned
   overnight.
   - Methylprednisolone 125mg 125 mg Q6H, today is day 5
   - Strongyloides O+P x3 negative (was to ensure that does not develop
   hyperstrongyloides syndrome)
   - Strongyloides Ab (IgG) pending, will follow
   - Patient tolerated NC at 5L over the day yesterday with no desats
   overnight, did not require nasal BiPap; however, this can be used
   overnight if needed as patient did not tolerate CPAP given concern for
   demand ischemia during the night secondary to low oxygen sat (goal > or
   = 90%) .
   - PPI for steroid ppx, insulin drip
   - Continue current management, follow up repeat CT of chest on Friday
   for improvement (to consider wean of steroids).  Will follow daily CXR
   and oxygen requirement.  If no improvement, can consider bronch for
   further evaluation.
   # CV:
   - Ischemia:  Likely unstable angina.  CP with no EKG changes.  ASA 81mg
   PO QOD, nitro paste. Metoprolol 100mg QID.  Daily ECG.
   Medical optimization at this point given complicating co-morbidities.
   ? GI / GERD component also.  Sucralfate QHS.
   -Rate control: Metoprolol 100 mg PO QID.  Patient has been bradycardic
   overnight for unclear reason, not symptomatic. AM Lopressor held. Will
   continue to monitor on tele. Continue Lopressor holding parameters.
   -Pump: Given increase in creatinine, no further diuresis; he appears to
   be autodiuresing.  Continuing to hold ACEI at this time given
   interaction with Tacrolimus and poor renal fxn.  Patient may benefit
   from this in the long term. Will rediscuss as renal function improves.
   # ID:
   Given AML and immunocompromised state, on Acyclovir (SHV), voriconazole
   (fungal), atovaquone (PCP) ppx.  WBC increased today, may be steroid
   induced, though entire CBC elevated.
   - Recheck CBC with diff this morning.
   - Enterococcus UTI, thought to be contaminant given slow growth on
   urine culture.  Repeat Ucx contaminated. Ucx from [**2184-4-19**] pending at
   this time.  If this is actual infection, will aggressively treat given
   immunocompromised.
   - Pending galactomannan, B-glucan negative.
   - Strongyloides O+P negative, Ab pending
   - CMV viral load ordered overnigh along with EBV and CMV PCR.
   - Will recheck B glucan and galactomannan on [**4-21**] as per ID
   # Hyperglycemia:
   With increased insulin requirement w/ steroids.  On insulin drip
   started on [**2184-4-18**].  Also on diabetic/heart healthy/neurtropenic diet.
   Was hypoglycemic overnight requiring D50 per protocol for BS <60.
   - Will continue to monitor q1H FSBG.  Adjust as per FS and with steroid
   dose tapers, transition to lantus/ISS as able
   # ARF:
   Creatinine 1.1 today, baseline 1.3-1.5.
   Likely tacro induced w/ high levels.  Per BMT, immunosuppressed
   patients do not mount antibody responses reliably, so negative testing
   for [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ant GBM, ANCA are not reliable.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Holding Tacro until level <5 per BMT, following levels (6.2
   yesterday, pending this am)
   # AML: STABLE. Tacrolimus currently being held, BMT will monitor
   levels.
   - Tacrolimus (as above), mycophenylate mofetil
   - Ppx: Acyclovir, voriconazole, atrovaquone
   - Review BMT recs
   # Thrombocytopenia:  STABLE.  Transfuse plts >20 unless actively
   bleeding

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52M h/o AML, day +148 s/p cord blood transplant,
   c/b ARDS [**2-14**] cyclosporine, readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] given increasing
   hypoxemia [**2-14**] BOOP.
    # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Likely [**2-14**] BOOP with possible cardiogenic component.  O2 weaned
   overnight.
   - Methylprednisolone 125mg Q6H, today is day 5, given moderate clinical
   improvement and concern over opportunistic infections in the setting of
   AML and high dose steroids, will change to 60mg PO prednisone daily.
   Will continue to reevaluate and titrate down as tolerated.
   - Strongyloides O+P x3 negative (was to ensure that does not develop
   hyperstrongyloides syndrome)
   - Strongyloides Ab (IgG) pending, will follow though low clinical use
   in the setting of immunocompromised state.
   - Patient tolerated NC at 5L over the day yesterday with no desats
   overnight, did not require nasal BiPap; however, this can be used
   overnight if needed as patient did not tolerate CPAP given concern for
   demand ischemia during the night secondary to low oxygen sat (goal > or
   = 90%) .
   - PPI for steroid ppx, insulin drip
   - Continue current management, follow up repeat CT of chest on Friday
   for improvement (to consider wean of steroids).  Will follow daily CXR
   and oxygen requirement.  If no improvement, can consider bronch for
   further evaluation.
   # CV:
   - Ischemia:  Likely unstable angina.  CP with no EKG changes.  ASA 81mg
   PO QOD, nitro paste. Metoprolol 100mg QID.  Daily ECG.
   Medical optimization at this point given complicating co-morbidities.
   ? GI / GERD component also.  Sucralfate QHS.
   -Rate control: Metoprolol 100 mg PO QID.  Patient has been bradycardic
   overnight for unclear reason, not symptomatic. AM Lopressor held. Will
   continue to monitor on tele. Continue Lopressor holding parameters.
   -Pump: Given increase in creatinine, no further diuresis; he appears to
   be autodiuresing.  Continuing to hold ACEI at this time given
   interaction with Tacrolimus and poor renal fxn.  Patient may benefit
   from this in the long term. Will rediscuss as renal function improves.
   # ID:
   Given AML and immunocompromised state, on Acyclovir (SHV), voriconazole
   (fungal), atovaquone (PCP) ppx.  WBC increased today, may be steroid
   induced, though entire CBC elevated.
   - Recheck CBC with diff this morning.
   - Enterococcus UTI, thought to be contaminant given slow growth on
   urine culture.  Repeat Ucx contaminated. Ucx from [**2184-4-19**] pending at
   this time.  If this is actual infection, will aggressively treat given
   immunocompromised.
   - Pending galactomannan, B-glucan negative.
   - Strongyloides O+P negative, Ab pending
   - CMV viral load ordered overnigh along with EBV and CMV PCR.
   - Will recheck B glucan and galactomannan on [**4-21**] as per ID
   # Hyperglycemia:
   With increased insulin requirement w/ steroids.  On insulin drip
   started on [**2184-4-18**].  Also on diabetic/heart healthy/neurtropenic diet.
   Was hypoglycemic overnight requiring D50 per protocol for BS <60.
   - Will continue to monitor q1H FSBG.  Adjust as per FS and with steroid
   dose tapers, transition to lantus/ISS as able
   # ARF:
   Creatinine 1.1 today, baseline 1.3-1.5.
   Likely tacro induced w/ high levels.  Per BMT, immunosuppressed
   patients do not mount antibody responses reliably, so negative testing
   for [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ant GBM, ANCA are not reliable.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Holding Tacro until level <5 per BMT, following levels (6.2
   yesterday, pending this am)
   # AML: STABLE. Tacrolimus currently being held, BMT will monitor
   levels.
   - Tacrolimus (as above), mycophenylate mofetil
   - Ppx: Acyclovir, voriconazole, atrovaquone
   - Review BMT recs
   # Thrombocytopenia:  STABLE.  Transfuse plts >20 unless actively
   bleeding

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] was seen and examined with the ICU team, and I was
   physically present for key portions of the services rendered.  The ICU
   team
s note reflects my input, with these comments:
   52-year-old male with AML s/p myeloablative unrelated cord blood
   transplant now approximately day +150.  Remote h/o sarcoidosis, unclear
   if it involved the lungs. Respiratory decompensation- initially
   occurred 3 weeks ago- requiring MICU/intubation- cyclosporin stopped
   and treated with Abx. Now developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, and
   CT demonstrated dense consolidation, multifocal, with air bronchograms.
   Empirically treating for BOOP, today is day 4 of high dose steroids.
   Key issue is hypoxemic respiratory failure:
          Clinically and radiographically improving on high dose
   steroids empiric for BOOP (which may be due to GVHD).
          Decrease corticosteroids to prednisone 60mg [**Hospital1 **] (has
   received 4 days of solumedrol 125 IV q6).
          Repeat HRCT Thursday night for discussion on rounds Friday.
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note.
   Will remain in MICU for continued unstable oxygenation (reported much
   better overnight but 91% on FM while writing this note) as well as
   continued IV insulin. Insulin needs will decrease as we decrease
   steroid dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplant approximately 150 days ago. He has a remote history of sarcoidosis, although it is unclear if it involved the lungs. The patient initially experienced respiratory decompensation three weeks ago and required mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. Currently, he is being treated with high-dose steroids empirically for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), which may be due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is the key issue, and he is showing clinical and radiographic improvement on high-dose steroids. The plan is to decrease corticosteroids to prednisone 60mg and repeat HRCT on Thursday night for discussion on rounds Friday. The patient will remain in the MICU for continued unstable oxygenation and continued IV insulin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is a serious condition requiring close monitoring and management. The dense consolidation and multifocal air bronchograms seen on CT indicate a significant lung pathology, possibly due to GVHD or infection.
2. BOOP: The patient is being treated empirically for BOOP, which is a type of non-infectious lung injury that can occur in immunocompromised patients. If left untreated"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] was seen and examined with the ICU team, and I was
   physically present for key portions of the services rendered.  The ICU
   team
s note reflects my input, with these comments:
   52-year-old male with AML s/p myeloablative unrelated cord blood
   transplant now approximately day +150.  Remote h/o sarcoidosis, unclear
   if it involved the lungs. Respiratory decompensation- initially
   occurred 3 weeks ago- requiring MICU/intubation- cyclosporin stopped
   and treated with Abx. Now developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, and
   CT demonstrated dense consolidation, multifocal, with air bronchograms.
   Empirically treating for BOOP, today is day 4 of high dose steroids.
   Respiratory failure:
   Clinically and radiographically improving on high dose steroids empiric
   for BOOP.
   Hypoxemia: Likely both BOOP (on high dose steroids) possibly [**2-14**] GVHD
   Decrease corticosteroids to prednisone 60mg [**Hospital1 **] (has received 4 days of
   solumedrol 125 IV q6).
   Repeat HRCT Thursday night for discussion on rounds Friday.
   Question of possible OSA (nightly desats), did not tolerate BiPAP. Will
   try nasal pillows as may be less uncomfortable than the full face
   BiPAP.
   Cardiac: Unstable angina, known CAD by MRI
   Cont Metop, nitro paste and daily ECGs. QOD ASA. ACE d/c given renal
   failure.
   Infection: Ruling out strongyloides with O and P (pending but unlikely)
   WBC inc. Late to attribute just to high dose steroids.
   -enterococcus urine: repeat UA/culture (not treating, still pending).
   (took three days for urine to grow out).
   - cont ppx
   Renal: slowly increasing BUN/Cr. Likely tacro. Goal fluid even.  Also
   ruling out lung-renal (pending).
    AML: following up with tacro levels, held for now (via BMT recs)
    Thrombocytopenia. Improving.
    Hyperglycemia. On insulin drip.
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an unrelated cord blood transplant approximately 150 days ago. He has a remote history of sarcoidosis, although it's unclear if it involved the lungs. The patient initially experienced respiratory decompensation three weeks ago and required mechanical ventilation and intubation. Cyclosporin was stopped, and he was treated with antibiotics. Now, the patient has developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, and a CT scan showed dense consolidation with air bronchograms. He is being treated empirically for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with high-dose steroids, which is day 4 of treatment. 

The patient's respiratory failure is clinically and radiographically improving on high-dose steroids. He also has hypoxemia, which is likely due to both BOOP and possibly graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The dose of corticosteroids should be decreased to prednisone 60mg. A repeat high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan is planned for discussion on rounds Friday. 

The patient has a history of unstable angina and known coronary artery disease (CAD), for which metoprolol, nitro paste, and daily ECGs are being continued. Aspirin is taken every other day, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are discontinued due to renal failure. 

In terms of infection, the patient's white blood cell count is increased, possibly due to high-dose steroids. Strongyloides testing is pending but unlikely. There is also a urinary tract infection with Enterococcus, which is being monitored but not actively treated. 

Renal function is slowly worsening, and the patient has increasing blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Tacrolimus toxicity is suspected, and fluid balance needs to be maintained. Lung-renal syndrome is also being ruled out. 

The patient's platelet count is improving, and hyperglycemia is being managed with an insulin drip. 

Other issues are detailed in the ICU team note."

   hypoxemia [**2-14**] BOOP.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Likely [**2-14**] BOOP with possible cardiogenic component.  On 5-6L NC during
   the day yesterday, dropped sats to mid-80s with improvement on 50% FM
   with sat range over the day from 89-100%.  No CP or SOB.
   - Methylprednisolone 125mg Q6H for 5 days, given moderate clinical
   improvement and concern over opportunistic infections in the setting of
   AML and high dose steroids, changed to 60mg PO prednisone daily. Will
   continue and reevaluate tomorrow with steroid taper as tolerated
   - Strongyloides O+P x3 negative (was to ensure that does not develop
   hyperstrongyloides syndrome)
   - Strongyloides Ab (IgG) pending, will follow though low clinical use
   in the setting of immunocompromised state.
   - No desats overnight. No nasal bipap as he tolerated the face mask at

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted to the ICU due to increasing hypoxemia and was diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient has been receiving high-dose steroids for treatment, which have been gradually tapered. His current condition is stable, with improved oxygenation on 50% FiO2 face mask. The patient's blood glucose levels have been variable, and he has been on insulin gtt to manage hyperglycemia. His renal function is stable and improved, likely due to tacrolimus-induced acute renal failure. The patient's platelet count remains low, and he is being closely monitored for any signs of bleeding. The patient's immunosuppressive state makes him susceptible to opportunistic infections, and he is receiving prophylactic antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. His code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of increasing hypoxemia and subsequent diagnosis of BOOP indicates a risk for respiratory failure. The patient's current stable condition on 50% FiO2 face mask is positive, but close monitoring is required.
2. Opportunistic infections: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a risk for various opportunistic infections, including fungal, viral, and bacterial infections."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted to the ICU due to increasing hypoxemia and was diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient is currently on high-dose steroids, which are being weaned off. His vital signs are stable, but he requires supplemental oxygen. He has a history of unstable angina and is on aspirin, nitro paste, and metoprolol for rate control. His renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 1.1. He is being closely monitored for opportunistic infections and is on prophylactic medications. The patient's blood glucose levels are variable and he is on an insulin drip. His platelet count is stable and he is not actively bleeding. The patient's condition is stable overall, but requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential risk for hypoxic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen levels and adjustment of supplemental oxygen is necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Cardiogenic component: There may be a cardiogenic component contributing to the patient's respiratory failure. Close monitoring of cardiac function and optimization of cardiovascular medications are essential.
3. Steroid-induced hyperglycemia: The patient is on high-dose steroids"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] was seen and examined with the ICU team, and I was
   physically present for key portions of the services rendered.  The ICU
   team
s note reflects my input, with these comments:
   Key issue is hypoxemic respiratory failure:
          Clinically and radiographically improving on high dose
   steroids empiric for BOOP.
          Continue prednisone 60mg [**Hospital1 **] (received 4 days of solumedrol
   125 IV q6).
          CT probably unnecessary given CXR improvement and improved
   hypoxemia.
   DM on insulin drip, still at relatively high doses. Will transition to
   long-acting insulin and cover with ISS.
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note.
   Will remain in MICU for continued unstable oxygenation (reported much
   better overnight but 91% on FM while writing this note) as well as
   continued IV insulin. Insulin needs will decrease as we decrease
   steroid dose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplant. He has a history of sarcoidosis, and his current chief complaint is hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient experienced respiratory decompensation a few weeks ago and required mechanical ventilation (MICU/intubation). He was treated with antibiotics and cyclosporin was stopped. Now, he has developed dense consolidation on CT scan with air bronchograms, and empirically, he is being treated for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). He received 4 days of high-dose steroids.

24-hour events include changing steroids to prednisone 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and the patient's saturation levels improving to the low 80s while on non-invasive ventilation. Allergies include Benadryl allergy (oral), Ambisome (intravenous), and Flomax (oral). The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Acyclovir on 04/19/08 at 8:00 PM. His current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
- Heart rate: 76 bpm (55-81 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 124/70 mmHg (83-138/57-85 mmHg)

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52M h/o AML, day +148 s/p cord blood transplant,
   c/b ARDS [**2-14**] cyclosporine, readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] given increasing
   hypoxemia [**2-14**] BOOP.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Likely [**2-14**] BOOP with possible cardiogenic component.  On 4-5L NC
   yesterday, desated overnight to 85% requiring 70% aerosol face mask.
   Continues to desat to 80s with minimal exertion. Hasn
t tolerated NIPPV
   in past due to sensation of claustrophobia.
   -Continue steroids for now, decreasing to 60mg QAM and 30mg tonight
   then to 60mg daily tomorrow.
   -Continue 02 supplementation, weaning as tolerated
   -Possible component of sleep disordered breathing at night leading to
   overnight bradycardia, desat. Will have trial of nasal CPAP/prong CPAP
   tonight.
   -Strongyloides negative
   -Goal I/O, even
   -no plans for CT chest at present
   # Hyperglycemia: Off insulin gtt, FSBS 132-349 overnight.
   - increased lantus to 60 daily, continue ISS plus standing humolog with
   meals. Monitor closely for hypoglycemia while tapering steroids.
   #Hyperkalemia: Likely due to increased intake and hyperglycemia.
   -Kayexelate today, repeat K
   -manage hyperglycemia as above
   -continue to monitor
   # CV:  Had episdode of nausea/diaphoresis during ICU stay, non-specific
   EKG changes, ruled out.  Overnight bradycardic
   - Ischemia:  Likely unstable angina.  CP with no EKG changes.  ASA 81mg
   PO QOD, nitro paste. [**Hospital **]
   Medical optimization at this point given complicating co-morbidities.
   ? GI / GERD component also.  Sucralfate QHS.
   -Rate control: Metoprolol 100 mg PO QID.  Bradycardia overnight has not
   been symptomatic. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to disordered breathing overnight.
   Decrease BB to TID
   -Pump: Given increase in creatinine, no further diuresis; he appears to
   be autodiuresing.  Continuing to hold ACEI at this time given
   interaction with Tacrolimus and poor renal fxn.  Patient may benefit
   from this in the long term. Will rediscuss as renal function improves.
   # ID:
   Given AML and immunocompromised state, on Acyclovir (SHV), voriconazole
   (fungal), atovaquone (PCP) ppx.
   - Enterococcus UTI, thought to be contaminant given slow growth on
   urine culture.  Repeat Ucx x2 contaminated.  Will continue to monitor
   clinically and resend if indicated. If this is actual infection, will
   aggressively treat given he is immunocompromised.
   - Pending galactomannan, B-glucan negative.
   # ARF: Stable and improved.  Baseline 1.3-1.5.
   Likely tacro induced w/ high levels.
   - Continue to trend.
   # AML: STABLE. Tacrolimus currently being held, per BMT, as levels now
   below 5, no need to continue to monitor levels. - Tacrolimus (as
   above), mycophenylate mofetil
   - Ppx: Acyclovir, voriconazole, atrovaquone

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing hypoxemia and was diagnosed with Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP), which is likely cardiogenic in nature. The patient is currently on steroids and oxygen supplementation, but continues to desaturate in the 80s with minimal exertion. He has not tolerated Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) due to claustrophobia.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, so his insulin regimen has been adjusted. His potassium levels are high, likely due to increased intake and hyperglycemia. He is being managed with Kayexelate and close monitoring of his blood glucose levels.

The patient had an episode of nausea/diaphoresis during his ICU stay, which was non-specific and ruled out ischemia. He is currently on aspirin and nitro paste for unstable angina.

His heart rate has been bradycardic overnight, but asymptomatic. He is on metoprolol for rate control. His creatinine levels have increased, so further diuresis has been withheld. His angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) has been held due to interaction with Tacrolimus and poor renal function.

The patient is immunocompromised and on various proph"

   Imaging: CXR [**4-22**]:
   As compared to the previous radiograph from [**2184-4-21**], there
   are no relevant radiographic changes. The extent of the moderate
   cardiomegaly is unchanged. The moderate parenchymal opacities in both
   lungs are also unchanged in extent and distribution. The tip of the
   double-lumen central venous access line left is still pointing at the
   lateral wall of the superior vena cava. There is no evidence of pleural
   effusions. In the interval, no new focal parenchymal opacities have

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52M h/o AML, day +148 s/p cord blood transplant,
   c/b ARDS [**2-14**] cyclosporine, readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] given increasing
   hypoxemia [**2-14**] BOOP.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Likely [**2-14**] BOOP with possible cardiogenic component.  On 5-6L NC during
   the day yesterday, dropped sats to mid-80s with improvement on 50% FM
   with sat range over the day from 89-100%.  No CP or SOB.
   - Methylprednisolone 125mg Q6H for 5 days, given moderate clinical
   improvement and concern over opportunistic infections in the setting of
   AML and high dose steroids, changed to 60mg PO prednisone daily. Will
   continue and reevaluate tomorrow with steroid taper as tolerated
   - Strongyloides O+P x3 negative (was to ensure that does not develop
   hyperstrongyloides syndrome)
   - Strongyloides Ab (IgG) pending, will follow though low clinical use
   in the setting of immunocompromised state.
   - No desats overnight. No nasal bipap as he tolerated the face mask at
   50%.  This can however be used overnight if needed as patient did not
   tolerate CPAP given concern for demand ischemia during the night
   secondary to low oxygen sat (goal > or = 90%) .
   - PPI for steroid ppx, insulin for steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
    - I/O goal even to slight negative, will give lasix if > or =500cc
   positive.
   - Continue current management, no need for CT on Thursday as CXR more
   clear and clinically improved.  Will follow daily CXR and oxygen
   requirement.
   # CV:
   - Ischemia:  Likely unstable angina.  CP with no EKG changes.  ASA 81mg
   PO QOD, nitro paste. Metoprolol 100mg QID.
   Medical optimization at this point given complicating co-morbidities.
   ? GI / GERD component also.  Sucralfate QHS.
   -Rate control: Metoprolol 100 mg PO QID.  Bradycardia overnight has not
   been symptomatic. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to disordered breathing overnight.
   Continue Lopressor holding parameters.
   -Pump: Given increase in creatinine, no further diuresis; he appears to
   be autodiuresing.  Continuing to hold ACEI at this time given
   interaction with Tacrolimus and poor renal fxn.  Patient may benefit
   from this in the long term. Will rediscuss as renal function improves.
   # ID:
   Given AML and immunocompromised state, on Acyclovir (SHV), voriconazole
   (fungal), atovaquone (PCP) ppx.
   - Enterococcus UTI, thought to be contaminant given slow growth on
   urine culture.  Repeat Ucx x2 contaminated.  Will continue to monitor
   clinically and resend if indicated. If this is actual infection, will
   aggressively treat given he is immunocompromised.
   - Pending galactomannan, B-glucan negative.
   - Strongyloides O+P negative, Ab pending
   - CMV viral load ordered overnight along with EBV and CMV PCR.
   - Will recheck B glucan and galactomannan on [**4-21**], today, as per ID
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Varible blood sugars over the day yesterday. On insulin gtt given hi
   FSBG on high dose steroids started on [**2184-4-18**].  Also on diabetic/heart
   healthy/neurtropenic diet. Was hypoglycemic overnight requiring D50 x1.
   - Calculate insulin need and give standing with sliding scale. Will
   continue to monitor as steroids decreased.
   # ARF: Stable and improved.  Baseline 1.3-1.5.
   Likely tacro induced w/ high levels.
   - Continue to trend.
   # AML: STABLE. Tacrolimus currently being held, per BMT, as levels now
   below 5, no need to continue to monitor levels. - Tacrolimus (as
   above), mycophenylate mofetil
   - Ppx: Acyclovir, voriconazole, atrovaquone
   - Review BMT recs
   # Thrombocytopenia:  STABLE.  Transfuse plts >20 unless actively

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU for increasing hypoxemia and was diagnosed with Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP). 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including methylprednisolone, prednisone, strongyloidiasis prophylaxis, proton pump inhibitor for steroid-induced gastritis, insulin for hyperglycemia, Lasix for fluid management, and sucralfate for possible gastrointestinal issues. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/85 mmHg to 147/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91% on a nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count compared to previous days. Blood glucose levels have been variable, ranging from 25 mg/dL to 248 mg/dL. Kidney function appears to be impaired, as indicated by an increased creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL.

   except for much improved resp function. Minimal dry cough, no
   significant dyspnea at rest. Good appetite.
   The ICU team
s note reflects my input, with these comments:
   Key issue is hypoxemic respiratory failure:
          Clinically and radiographically improving on high dose
   steroids empiric for BOOP. Continues to have periods of severe
   hypoxemia, particularly with any exertion.
          Tapering prednisone as outlined above. Will maintain on
   prednisone 60mg qd after today.
   Hyperglycemia- off insulin drip, still needing adjusting of long-acting
   insulin and cover with ISS.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52M h/o AML, day +148 s/p cord blood transplant,
   c/b ARDS [**2-14**] cyclosporine, readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] given increasing
   hypoxemia [**2-14**] BOOP.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Likely [**2-14**] BOOP with possible cardiogenic component.  Slowly responding
   with steroids, improved 02 overnight with less 02 requirement this
   morning, clinically improved.
   - Taper steroids to 60 mg daily for ~5 days, then continue to taper.
   - Strongyloides O+P x3 negative (was to ensure that does not develop
   hyperstrongyloides syndrome)
   - Strongyloides Ab (IgG) negative
   - No desats overnight, only tolerated CPAP for 2 hours. If desats again
   overnight will try CPAP nasal pillows.
   - PPI for steroid ppx, insulin for steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
    - I/O goal even to slight negative, diurese if >500mL positive, was
   almost 2L negative (autodiuresed)
   - No CT chest for now.  Following CXR which is the same to slightly
   improved today
   -Continue IS and OOB today.
   # Hyperglycemia:
   In setting of steroid use.  Pt not diabetic. Had requiried insulin gtt.
   Now on standing and SSI.  FSBS continue to be elevated in 200-300s.
   - Switch to NPH [**Hospital1 **] [**4-24**] in am for ease of titration, especially as pt
   becomes hypoglycemic overnight. Continue current dose standing and SS
   regular insuline.
   - diabetic diet
   - Monitor closely as steroids tapered.
   # CV:
   - Ischemia:  Likely unstable angina.  CP with no EKG changes.  ASA 81mg
   PO QOD, nitro paste. Metoprolol decreased to [**Hospital 2085**]
   Medical optimization at this point given complicating co-morbidities.
   ? GI / GERD component also.  Sucralfate QHS.
   -Rate control: Metoprolol 100 mg PO TID, decreased yesterday in setting
   of PM bradycardia.
   -Pump: Given increase in creatinine, no further diuresis; he appears to
   be autodiuresing.  Continuing to hold ACEI at this time given
   interaction with Tacrolimus and poor renal fxn.  Patient may benefit
   from this in the long term. Will rediscuss as renal function improves.
   # ID:
   Given AML and immunocompromised state, on Acyclovir (SHV), voriconazole
   (fungal), atovaquone (PCP) ppx.
   - Enterococcus UTI, thought to be contaminant given slow growth on
   urine culture.  Repeat Ucx x2 contaminated.  Will continue to monitor
   clinically and resend if indicated. If this is actual infection, will
   aggressively treat given he is immunocompromised.
   - Pending galactomannan, B-glucan negative.
   - Strongyloides O+P negative, Ab negative
   - CMV viral load negative
   - Will recheck B glucan and galactomannan on [**4-21**], today, as per ID,
   pending currently.
   # ARF: Stable and improved.  Baseline 1.3-1.5.
   Likely tacro induced w/ high levels.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Continue to hold tacrolimus and ACEI, follow up BMT recs.
   # AML: STABLE. Tacrolimus currently being held, per BMT, as levels now
   below 5, no need to continue to monitor levels. - Tacrolimus (as
   above), mycophenylate mofetil
   - Ppx: Acyclovir, voriconazole, atrovaquone
   - Review BMT recs
   # Thrombocytopenia:  STABLE.  Transfuse plts >20 unless actively
   bleeding

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] was seen and examined with the ICU team, and I was
   physically present for key portions of the services rendered. No sig
   changes to PMH, SH, FH, ROS since the admit note, which I reviewed,
   except for continued improved resp function. Minimal dry cough, no
   dyspnea at rest. Good appetite. CXR sig improved.
   The ICU team
s note reflects my input, with these comments:
   Key issue is hypoxemic respiratory failure:
          Clinically and radiographically improving on high dose
   steroids empiric for BOOP. Tapering to 60 PO qd prednisone. Continues
   to have periods of severe hypoxemia, particularly with any exertion.
   Hyperglycemia- off insulin drip, still needing adjusting of long-acting
   insulin and cover with ISS.
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He was readmitted to the ICU due to increasing hypoxemia and was diagnosed with Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP). The patient is currently on high-dose steroids and being weaned off them.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/73 to 147/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 42 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, glucose level of 248 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, ischemic heart disease, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is receiving various medications, including steroids, insulin, cyclosporine, and antibiotics for possible Enterococcus UTI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further"

   Assessment and Plan: 52M h/o AML, day +148 s/p cord blood transplant,
   c/b ARDS [**2-14**] cyclosporine, readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] given increasing
   hypoxemia [**2-14**] BOOP.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Likely [**2-14**] BOOP with possible cardiogenic component.  On 5-6L NC during
   the day yesterday, dropped sats to mid-80s with improvement on 50% FM
   with sat range over the day from 89-100%.  No CP or SOB.
   - Methylprednisolone 125mg Q6H for 5 days, given moderate clinical
   improvement and concern over opportunistic infections in the setting of
   AML and high dose steroids, changed to 60mg PO prednisone daily. Will
   continue and reevaluate tomorrow with steroid taper as tolerated
   - Strongyloides O+P x3 negative (was to ensure that does not develop
   hyperstrongyloides syndrome)
   - Strongyloides Ab (IgG) pending, will follow though low clinical use
   in the setting of immunocompromised state.
   - No desats overnight. No nasal bipap as he tolerated the face mask at
   50%.  This can however be used overnight if needed as patient did not
   tolerate CPAP given concern for demand ischemia during the night
   secondary to low oxygen sat (goal > or = 90%) .
   - PPI for steroid ppx, insulin for steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
    - I/O goal even to slight negative, will give lasix if > or =500cc
   positive.
   - Continue current management, no need for CT on Thursday as CXR more
   clear and clinically improved.  Will follow daily CXR and oxygen
   requirement.
   # CV:
   - Ischemia:  Likely unstable angina.  CP with no EKG changes.  ASA 81mg
   PO QOD, nitro paste. Metoprolol 100mg QID.
   Medical optimization at this point given complicating co-morbidities.
   ? GI / GERD component also.  Sucralfate QHS.
   -Rate control: Metoprolol 100 mg PO QID.  Bradycardia overnight has not

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU. The patient has been tolerating oral intake well and has been increasing their oral intake by 1 L by 10 pm on their own. The patient's potassium levels improved after receiving kayexalate and reached 4.4. However, the patient did not tolerate nasal bipap and was unable to sleep with it on, with saturation levels still in the low 90s.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's inability to tolerate nasal bipap and maintaining low saturation levels in the 90s indicate a potential respiratory distress.
2. Fluid overload: The fluid balance sheet shows a negative balance of -1970 mL, suggesting possible fluid overload.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's initial potassium level was low at 3.4, which improved after receiving kayexalate. However, careful monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent further imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, with a high of 11.6 on 04/20 and a low of 2.5 on 04/17. This could indicate an ongoing infection or response to treatment.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been consistently below"

   Assessment and Plan: 52M h/o AML, day +148 s/p cord blood transplant,
   c/b ARDS [**2-14**] cyclosporine, readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] given increasing
   hypoxemia [**2-14**] BOOP.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Likely [**2-14**] BOOP with possible cardiogenic component.  Slowly responding
   with steroids, improved 02 overnight with less 02 requirement this
   morning, clinically improved.
   - Taper steroids to 60 mg daily for ~5 days, then continue to taper.
   - Strongyloides O+P x3 negative (was to ensure that does not develop
   hyperstrongyloides syndrome)
   - Strongyloides Ab (IgG) negative
   - No desats overnight, only tolerated CPAP for 2 hours. If desats again
   overnight will try CPAP nasal pillows.
   - PPI for steroid ppx, insulin for steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
    - I/O goal even to slight negative, diurese if >500mL positive, was
   almost 2L negative (autodiuresed)
   - No CT chest for now.  Following CXR which is the same to slightly
   improved today
   -Continue IS and OOB today.
   # Hyperglycemia:
   In setting of steroid use.  Pt not diabetic. Had requiried insulin gtt.
   Now on standing and SSI.  FSBS continue to be elevated in 200-300s.
   - Switch to NPH [**Hospital1 **] [**4-24**] in am for ease of titration, especially as pt
   becomes hypoglycemic overnight. Continue current dose standing and SS
   regular insuline.
   - diabetic diet
   - Monitor closely as steroids tapered.
   # CV:
   - Ischemia:  Likely unstable angina.  CP with no EKG changes.  ASA 81mg
   PO QOD, nitro paste. Metoprolol decreased to [**Hospital 2085**]
   Medical optimization at this point given complicating co-morbidities.
   ? GI / GERD component also.  Sucralfate QHS.
   -Rate control: Metoprolol 100 mg PO TID, decreased yesterday in setting
   of PM bradycardia.
   -Pump: Given increase in creatinine, no further diuresis; he appears to
   be autodiuresing.  Continuing to hold ACEI at this time given
   interaction with Tacrolimus and poor renal fxn.  Patient may benefit
   from this in the long term. Will rediscuss as renal function improves.
   # ID:
   Given AML and immunocompromised state, on Acyclovir (SHV), voriconazole
   (fungal), atovaquone (PCP) ppx.
   - Enterococcus UTI, thought to be contaminant given slow growth on
   urine culture.  Repeat Ucx x2 contaminated.  Will continue to monitor
   clinically and resend if indicated. If this is actual infection, will
   aggressively treat given he is immunocompromised.
   - Pending galactomannan, B-glucan negative.
