","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of dyslipidemia who presented with symptoms of chest pain and nausea. She had a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and underwent bare metal stent placement. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with anticoagulant medications such as heparin and integrellin to prevent further clot formation.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 85/59 mmHg, bradycardia with a heart rate of 55 bpm, and normal oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits at 15 breaths per minute.

The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular system, but there is a small bruise with a minimal hematoma at the right groin. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there are no peripheral pulses assessed due to the bandage on the right groin.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count at 171 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level at 132 mg/dL, and decreased hemoglobin level at 11.1 g/dL. The cardiac markers Troponin-T and CK-MB are elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The imaging shows evidence of fluid overload and small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's medical history includes dyslipidemia, hypertension, and previous use of"

She underwent bare metal stent placement and was started on integrin and heparin. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, especially while asleep, and the evening dose of captopril was held. This could be due to vasovagal response or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate hemodynamic support should be provided.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been in the 80s-90s, which may require beta-blocker therapy for rate control. However, caution should be exercised due to the risk of vasovagal response and bradycardia with sheath removal.
3. Fluid Overload: The chest X-ray revealed increased bilateral peripheral and perihilar interstitial opacities, suggesting fluid overload. Monitoring of fluid balance and adjusting the fluid intake/output accordingly is essential.
4. Pleural Effusion: Small bilateral pleural effusions were noted on imaging, which can be associated with heart failure or infection. Further evaluation and management may be required.
5. Atelectasis: Linear opacity at the"

   is not an uncommon phenomenon, present in 20-50% of pts in numerous
   trials assessing this marker of poor prognosis.   Perisistent ST
   elevations despite TIMI III flow are possibly due to microvascular

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - scant bibas rales
   Heart - soft HSM
   ext no edema.
   Medical Decision Making
   86 female her with anterion STEMI s/p successful revasc with BMS. We
   will push beta blockers as BP allows. Will add warfarin to prevent
   mural thrombus. Plavix and asa mandatory for one month and out to one
   year if possible. Lipito 80 mg QD per PROVE IT TIMI 22. Hopefully the
   wall motion is myocardial stunning as CK/MB rise was moderate for the
   degree of wall motion abnormality. Will resume ACEI when BP allow. Team
   had been told to watch for increase MR murmur and free wall rupture.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed with primary
   care physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female who presented with chest pressure and nausea. She had a previous history of dyslipidemia and was experiencing shortness of breath for the past two months. The patient's symptoms worsened, and she was brought to the emergency department. She experienced severe chest pain associated with ST elevations in V3-V6, and an occluded LAD was found during a cardiac catheterization. A bare metal stent was placed in the mid LAD, and post-dilation was performed. The patient's ejection fraction is 30-35%. She has been experiencing intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive with blood pressures in the high 70s/30s overnight. This could indicate potential cardiogenic shock or allergic reaction.
2. Allergic reaction: The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and iodine. She experienced a choking sensation overnight, which may suggest an allergic response. Monitoring for signs of anaphylaxis, such as throat closing, hypotension, and other allergic symptoms, is important.
3. Ventricular thrombus: The patient may be at risk for developing a ventricular thrombus due to her history of myocardial infarction and reduced ejection fraction. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin may be necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of dyslipidemia who presented with symptoms of chest pain, nausea, and shortness of breath. She underwent an angioplasty and had a bare metal stent placed in the mid Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery due to a complete occlusion. 

The patient was loaded with Integrilin and heparin, and started on low-dose captopril for cardioprotection. She was also prescribed atorvastatin, ASA, Plavix, and metoprolol. The patient's blood pressure has been low, particularly at night, and the evening dose of captopril was withheld. The patient's heart rate has been in the 80s-90s, and beta-blocker therapy may be considered for rate control.

The patient experienced a STEMI with persistent ST elevation on ECG despite revascularization. She received intravenous steroids within 24 hours of the STEMI. Post-infarct echocardiography showed a 35% ejection fraction, and the patient has persistent hypotension, likely due to poor contractility. She is currently responding well to dopamine.

The patient has maintained normal sinus rhythm with intermittent PVCs. She also has anemia with a hematocrit level of 32%, and will be monitored closely. The patient is at risk for anaphylaxis due to a contrast allergy, and will"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of dyslipidemia, who presented with symptoms of chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the mid-left anterior descending artery. The patient remains hypotensive despite receiving fluids and dopamine, and has persistent ST elevation on ECG.

The patient's current medications include atorvastatin, aspirin, and Plavix. She is also receiving IV heparin and dopamine for hemodynamic support. The plan is to hold beta-blockers until her blood pressure improves and consider ACE inhibitors when appropriate.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin-T), along with slightly elevated white blood cell count and platelets. Her hemoglobin levels are within normal range, but her hematocrit is slightly low. Electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium, are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of long-term estrogen therapy, which is being discontinued due to hypoestrogenism. She is also being followed for possible multiple myeloma, anemia, and a history of lumbar laminectomy with growth stim.

The patient is currently on a cardiac low-sodium diet and receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers,"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yof w/ h/o dyslipidemia p/w SSCP and nausea, STE on ECG, and
   complete occlusion of mid LAD, s/p bare metal stent placement.
   # CORONARIES - Pt s/p  bare metal stent.   She was loaded with
   integrellin and heparin.  She was also started on low dose captopril
   for cardioprotection.  BB was deferred given risk of vasovagal response
   and bradycardia with sheath removal.  She has remained hypotensive
   while asleep, normotensive when awake.  Given low nighttime blood
   pressures evening dose of captopril was held.  Continues to have HR in
   80s-90s.  BB for HR control may have better outcomes.  Does not require
   afterload reduction at present
   - atorvastatin 80
   - ASA 325
   - Plavix 75
   - will hold BB until BP improves.
   - will consider ACE when BP improves
   # PUMP:  Pt now s/p STEMI with worsening STE on ECG s/p intervention.
   Perisistent STE after revascularization is not an uncommon phenomenon,
   present in 20-50% of pts in numerous trials assessing this marker of
   poor prognosis,  increasing risk of LV aneurysmal formation, possibly
   other mechanical complications.  She also recieved IV steroids w/in 24
   hrs of STEMI, some data suggests this may possibly increase risk of
   mechanical complication.   Post infarct ECHO shows 35% and pt has
   persistent hypotension, responding minimally to fluids.  Poor
   contractility is likely the cause of hypotension.  Doing well on
   Dopamine.
   - continue Dopa, wean as tolerated
   - follow UOP and O2 sats
   - contin heparin for ventricular thrombus
   - initiated coumadin 5mg  [**11-30**], can f/u in 3 months for repeat ECHO,
   and possible d/c at that time.
   # RHYTHM: Pt has maintained nl sinus rhythm throughout, intermittent
   PVCs
   #Anemia
 Hct 32.  Baseline 40.  Negative 1L post cath (after being
   given IVF for renal protection prior to cath).
   -          Acute blood loss anemia, though significant blood loss not
   reported with procedure
   -          dilutional, pt received IVF prior to admission to the CCU
   -          will trend, Transfuse if Hct <27 or sx.
   -
   # Contrast allergy - Pt has risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast she
   was given for PCI.  She was pretreated with solumedrol and benadryl.
   Will have to follow for signs of anaphylaxis, including throat closing,
   hypotension.  No severe sx.  Hypotension can be attributed to this
   also, but she has been premedicated, and has no respiratory sx.
   - Loratadine prn
   # ?Hypoestrogenism - Pt on long term estrogen therapy since the late
   [**2037**].  Not needed.
   - d/c estrogen
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid
   #MGUS - stable, followed as outpt
   #L2 - L3 Laminectomy s/p growth stim, leads unable to be removed, pt
   unable to get MRI.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - bibas rales
   heart - soft HSM
   ext - no edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs [**Known lastname 3335**] is doing better today with ongoing hypotension overnight
   requiring moderate doses of dopamine to keep BPs in the 90-100 range.
   She reports no further chest pain. DA is at 3.5 mcg/min. She has a low
   grade temp with a rising wbc count to 10.1. Renal function is stable.
   Her hypotension is likely from stunning as she is only on low dose
   metoprolol. CK peaked in the 970 range. We will continue plavix and asa
   for one year as well as coumadin for prophylaxis against mural
   thrombus. We will give her H2B for GI coverage while she is taking
   three anticoagulants. To floor once DA weaned off.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of dyslipidemia.
- She presented with nausea and chest pressure one day prior to admission.
- The symptoms started after dinner and were described as a mid-chest pressure without radiation.
- She experienced severe nausea and went to bed with minimal chest pain.
- The next morning, the pain worsened, becoming sharp and substernal, associated with nausea.
- She denied any associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, radiation, recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, or hematemesis.
- The patient called EMS and was brought to the emergency department.
- On the floor, she experienced worsening chest pain associated with ST elevations in V3-V6, leading to transfer to the cath lab.
- A catheterization demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid-level with moderate disease elsewhere.
- A 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid-LAD, and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon, with TIMI 3 flow following the procedure.
- Echo showed severe hypokinesis to akinesis in the anterior wall with an ejection fraction of 30-35%.
- Her CK peak was 976, MB 9.5, and troponin-T 6.13.
- Integrilin was discontinued.
- BPs have been around 80/60, and ACEI has been withheld.
- She reports no further chest pain but experiences intermittent throat tightness.
- Physical examination reveals bibasilar rales, soft HSM, and no edema.
- Medical decision making includes ongoing hypotension requiring moderate doses of dopamine, rising WBC count, stable renal function, and plans for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Contrast allergy: The patient has a risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast due to her previous reaction during PCI. She was premedicated with steroids and antihistamines, but close monitoring for signs of anaphylaxis is essential.

2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced persistent hypotension, requiring dopamine to maintain blood pressure in the 90-100 range. This could indicate myocardial stunning or other cardiac complications.

3. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 32.5%, indicating acute blood loss anemia. This may be due to blood loss during the procedure or dilutional anemia from IV fluids.

4. Ventricular thrombus: The patient has persistent ST elevations on ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular thrombus formation. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin and coumadin is planned to prevent this complication.

5. Hypothyroidism:"
