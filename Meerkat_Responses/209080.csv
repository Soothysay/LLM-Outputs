","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of recent hospital admission for influenza pneumonitis, concern for superimposed bacterial pneumonia presenting with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia. There is a concern for nosocomial infection, with different strains of influenza or other viral etiologies such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A chest X-ray is recommended to further evaluate the condition.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely due to the underlying pneumonia. Common causes of fever include bacterial infection, influenza, or other viral etiologies. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered to identify the causative organism. Influenza DFA test is negative, and viral cxs including RSV are pending.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to delirium caused by factors such as pneumonia, fever, hypoxia, and his pre-existing dementia. Antibiotics have been started, and further evaluation of cultures and vital signs will be done.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped significantly, indicating anemia. The cause of anemia is unclear, but it may be related to gastrointestinal bleeding"

","The patient is an 89-year-old male who was recently discharged after spending time in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for influenza pneumonitis. He is currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct). The patient's clinical course suggests ongoing superimposed bacterial pneumonia. 

The patient's respiratory failure has a complex etiology, including failed treatment of pneumonia with vancomycin and meropenem, inability to clear secretions, pulmonary edema, and possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia. Other viral etiologies such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and atypical community-acquired pneumonia are also considered due to diffuse reticular opacities seen on chest X-ray. Given the recent course of influenza, ongoing secondary pneumonia is likely. A pulmonary embolism is low on the differential.

The patient is being treated with levofloxacin, meropenem, and linezolid, which were recently used during his MICU stay. He is also receiving fluids and diuretics to manage fluid overload and improve oxygenation. The plan is to hold off on weaning or extubation until an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is performed in the morning. 

The patient has a fever, and the most likely etiology is pneumonia, but Clostridium difficile infection is possible given recent antibiotic use and a white blood cell count above 20"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with recent hospital admission for influenza pneumonitis and concern for superimposed bacterial pneumonia. He is presenting with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The patient's respiratory status is critical as he requires mechanical ventilation and has a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV. His vital signs show tachycardia (HR: 110 bpm) and slightly elevated blood pressure (BP: 130/69 mmHg). Oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% with FiO2 of 50%. 

The patient has received blood transfusions totaling 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to anemia, but the source of bleeding remains unclear. His renal function has improved slightly with a decrease in creatinine levels. 

The patient is also experiencing copious secretions, and there is concern for ongoing nosocomial pneumonia. Imaging shows an infiltrate in the right lower lobe (RLL), which may indicate pneumonia. 

Other lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.5 K/uL, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte imbalances are present with hyponatremia (Na+: 125 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (K+: 3.4 mEq/L).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a recent hospital admission for influenza pneumonitis, concern for superimposed bacterial pneumonia, respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and his hemoglobin (Hct) is now at 30%. The patient has been febrile and has ongoing copious secretions. Legionella Ag and influenza DFA tests were negative. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's recent hospital admission and respiratory failure raise concern for a nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia. The right lower lobe (RLL) appears to be developing an infiltrate on the chest X-ray. The patient's secretions are also a major issue.
2. Volume overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, as indicated by the increased edema on the chest X-ray and fluid balance data.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a Hct of 21.3%. The source of bleeding is not definite, and there is no evidence of hemolysis. Endoscopy is pending to investigate further.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient initially presented with acute renal failure (ARF), but his creatinine level has improved to baseline"

   A/P:89 yr old male recent hospital admission for influenza pneumonitis,
   concern for superimposed bacterial pneumonia presenting with
   respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, anemia and ARF.
   Respiratory Failure: Suspect an ongoing nosocomial PNA - RLL appears to
   be developing an infiltrate.  Pt also appears by CXR to be volume up in
   setting of pRBC and IVF.  Secretions also a major issue.  Will aim to
   diuresis today and monitor secretions - hopefully will be extubatable
   tomorrow.
   Fever: Will stay with linezolid, meropenem, levoflox as current abx
   choice.  D/C Tamiflu
   Leukocytosis: Check C. diff, F/U cultures.
   Anemia: Now s/p 6 units pRBCs. No definite source of bleeding.  No
   evidence of hemolysis.  Endoscopy pending for tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a recent hospital admission for influenza pneumonitis and concern for superimposed bacterial pneumonia. He presented with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, anemia, and acute kidney injury (ARF). The patient was intubated in the emergency department and started on empiric linezolid due to recent prolonged vancomycin course. He received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for acute Hct drop, with no obvious bleeding. An endoscopy is planned for tomorrow to investigate the cause of anemia. The patient continues to have copious secretions and ongoing fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has been in the ICU for some time, and there is a concern for developing a nosocomial pneumonia, particularly with the development of right lower lobe infiltrates on the chest X-ray.
2. Volume overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded based on the chest X-ray findings and fluid balance chart, which shows a positive fluid balance. This can contribute to worsening respiratory distress.
3. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The respiratory secretions are copious, and the patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although no obvious source of bleeding was identified, the patient received p"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male who was recently discharged from the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for influenza pneumonitis and is now presenting with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). The patient has a history of dementia and was readmitted to the hospital with suspected ongoing superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The patient's clinical course suggests a complex etiology for respiratory failure, including potential treatment failure of initial antibiotics, inability to clear secretions, pulmonary edema, and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. Other possible causes of respiratory failure include viral etiologies such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and atypical community-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a combination of factors, including failed treatment of pneumonia with initial antibiotics, inability to clear secretions, and pulmonary edema. The patient appears to be volume overloaded on the chest X-ray and has not responded to intravenous fluid boluses. Given the recent course of influenza, ongoing secondary pneumonia is likely.

2. Fever: The patient's fever could be due to ongoing pneumonia or Clostridium difficile infection. The white blood cell count is elevated, which supports the possibility of an infection. Ruling out respiratory viral causes and gastrointestinal bleeding as potential sources of fever is recommended.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 31 to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male who was recently discharged after a MICU stay for influenza pneumonitis. He is now presenting with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). The assessment suggests that the patient has ongoing superimposed bacterial pneumonia, possibly due to failed treatment of previous pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn. There is also a concern for aspiration pneumonitis and acute flare-up of underlying interstitial lung disease. The patient has diffuse reticular opacities on chest X-ray, which could be indicative of viral etiologies such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and atypical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's tachycardia may be due to pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by a combination of factors, including failed treatment of pneumonia, inability to clear secretions leading to aspiration pneumonitis, and acute flare-up of underlying interstitial lung disease.
2. Ongoing Superimposed Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient's ongoing symptoms and laboratory findings suggest the possibility of bacterial pneumonia superimposed on the existing condition.
3. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The presence of coffee grounds in the nasogastric lavage and negative guaiac from Golightly BM suggests the possibility of aspiration pneumonitis.
4. Acute Flare-up of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital for influenza pneumonitis and concern for superimposed bacterial pneumonia. He presented with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, anemia, and acute kidney injury (ARF). The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to anemia but has no definite source of bleeding. There is no evidence of hemolysis. The patient's creatinine level is decreasing, indicating improvement in ARF. Troponin levels are also trending down, suggesting improvement in cardiac function. The patient has been diagnosed with leukocytosis and is being treated with antibiotics. A fibrotic process consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD) was found on CT chest, and further investigation for ILD is recommended. The patient's condition remains critical, and he requires ongoing intensive care unit (ICU) care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia. Lower lobe infiltrates are present, but there is also an upper lobe predominant fibrotic process that could be related to ILD. Volume overload may contribute to the respiratory failure, especially with recent transfusions and IV fluids. Secretions may pose a challenge for extubation.

2. Fever: The patient was febrile, and antibiotics have been initiated. It is important to continue monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 89-year-old male who was recently discharged after a stay in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for influenza pneumonitis.
- He is now admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct).
- The initial concern was ongoing superimposed bacterial pneumonia.
- Anemia was suspected due to the hct drop from 31% to 22%, but the etiology was initially unclear. It was presumed to be a GI bleed, but hemolysis labs were normal.
- The patient received 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and his hct did not appropriately rise until after the third unit. The final hct was 30%, with no evidence of hemodynamic instability.
- Guaiac negative results from glycolytic blood and reported coffee grounds in the nasogastric (NG) lavage performed in the emergency department (ED).
- Bile was currently present when OG suctioned, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on [**3-21**] showed a clean upper GI tract without evidence of bleeding.
- Colonoscopy was not performed, with guaiac negative stools and [**Month/Year (2) 1657**].
- Nursing noted swelling of the right knee and right lower extremity. Plain films of the right knee were negative,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, his vital signs were unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated troponin levels. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a low hematocrit level. An endoscopy was performed, which showed no active bleeding. However, a large hematoma was found in his thigh, and he has swelling in his right leg. Imaging studies, including a transthoracic echo, chest X-ray, and CT scan of the thigh, are pending. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he is on multiple vasopressors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability. This could lead to organ dysfunction and poor tissue perfusion.
2. Respiratory failure: Despite being on mechanical ventilation, the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters may not be optimal, increasing the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Thromboembolic events: The presence of a large hematoma in the thigh and leg swelling raise concerns for deep vein throm"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male who was recently discharged after a stay in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for influenza pneumonitis. He is currently in the ICU again due to respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, and a drop in hematocrit (HCT). The patient's condition is complex and includes possible ongoing superimposed bacterial pneumonia, failed treatment of pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn, inability to clear secretions causing respiratory pneumonitis or acute flare-up of underlying interstitial lung disease. Other potential causes such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), viral etiologies like RSV, and atypical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are also being considered. The patient has persistent tachycardia despite adequate hydration.

Plan:
1. All cultures are negative, and the patient is afebrile. Meropenem, linezolid, and levofloxacin will be discontinued due to failure of vancomycin.
2. Tamiflu will be stopped now that the influenza DFA test is negative.
3. Viral CX including RSV is pending, and blood/sputum/urine cultures will be followed up.
4. The underlying interstitial lung disease will be evaluated further by checking [Doctor's First Name] RF, anti-SCL70, ESR, ANC, and PFTs once the patient is extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a recent hospital admission for influenza pneumonitis, concern for superimposed bacterial pneumonia presenting with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, anemia, and acute renal failure. He now presents with hemorrhage into his right thigh without a clear cause. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, new mastoiditis on CT head, acute blood loss anemia due to bleed into the right thigh, acute renal failure with creatinine down to baseline, abnormal EKG without evidence of acute coronary syndrome, and full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia. This could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Hemorrhage into the right thigh: The source of bleeding is unclear, but it has resulted in acute blood loss anemia. If the bleeding continues or recurs, it could lead to hypovolemic shock and further complications.
3. Mastoiditis: The patient has developed mastoiditis, which is an infection of the mastoid bone in the skull. If left untreated, it can spread to the brain and other structures, leading to serious complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is indicated by elevated creatinine levels. If not addressed, it could progress to chronic renal failure and require dialysis.
5. Abnormal EKG: The patient's EKG shows abnormalities, but there is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome. However, further evaluation is necessary to rule out any cardiac issues that may require intervention.
6. Code status: The patient is currently listed as full code, meaning that all measures will be taken to resuscitate him in case of cardiac or respiratory arrest. However, this decision may need to be reassessed based on the patient's overall prognosis and preferences.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent further deterioration."

   Imaging: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild focal hypokinesis of the
   apex and the mid to apical septum, anterior, and lateral walls. The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are difficult to assess
   due to suboptimal technical quality, but are probably normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular
   dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease or other focal
   myopathic process. Borderline pulmonary hypertension. Resting
   tachycardia.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-3-7**], left
   ventricular function appears more vigorous. Resting heart rate is now
   faster.

   Imaging: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild focal hypokinesis of the
   apex and the mid to apical septum, anterior, and lateral walls. The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are difficult to assess
   due to suboptimal technical quality, but are probably normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular
   dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease or other focal
   myopathic process. Borderline pulmonary hypertension. Resting
   tachycardia.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-3-7**], left
   ventricular function appears more vigorous. Resting heart rate is now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male who was recently discharged from the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for influenza pneumonitis. He presented with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct). Initially, the cause of the hct drop was unclear but was presumed to be a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. However, hemolysis labs were normal, and the patient received 9 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) with only a slight rise in hct. Further investigation revealed the presence of bile in the gastric lavage, suggesting a possible biliary source of bleeding rather than a GI bleed. A subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a clean upper GI tract without evidence of bleeding. Colonoscopy was not performed, and guaiac tests on stool samples were negative.

The patient also had swelling of the right knee and right lower extremity, which was initially thought to be due to a musculoskeletal issue. However, a lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasound (LENI) revealed a hematoma. The vascular service recommended a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the right lower extremity, which showed a large hematoma without evidence of active extravasation of contrast.

The patient's respiratory status has been complicated by respiratory failure, likely due to failed treatment of pneumonia (PNA) with vancomycin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital for influenza pneumonitis and concern for superimposed bacterial pneumonia. He presented with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient was extubated yesterday and has now developed hemorrhage into his right thigh without a clear cause. 

His current assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has improved, with suspicion of aspiration rather than nosocomial pneumonia.
