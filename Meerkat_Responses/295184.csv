","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of long-standing cocaine and alcohol abuse, presenting with suicidality in the setting of cocaine/etoh intoxication. He attempted suicide in [**2186**] and is currently sober. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is being managed for agitation, tachycardia, suicide ideation, anion gap acidosis, hypernatremia, and other medical conditions. He is receiving supportive care, including IV fluids, sedation as needed, and psychiatric monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient may continue to experience agitation due to withdrawal symptoms from cocaine or other substances. Close monitoring and management with non-pharmacological interventions and PRN haloperidol are recommended.
2. Suicide ideation: The patient has a history of suicide attempts and current suicidality. It is crucial to provide continuous psychiatric monitoring and ensure the patient does not leave the hospital against medical advice. Consideration for long-term psychiatric treatment and support should be discussed.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has resolved, but it is essential to monitor his heart rate closely for any signs of recurrence. If necessary, further intervention may be required.
4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient had resolved anion gap acidosis, but there is a risk of recurrence if underlying causes are not appropriately addressed. Regular monitoring of acid-base"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of irritability. The patient's vital signs show hypertension (BP: 165/83 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR: 68 bpm). The patient's temperature is within normal range (Tcurrent: 36.1 C), and respiratory rate is normal (RR: 18 insp/min). Oxygen saturation is at 97% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 580 mL, with 540 mL given orally, 40 mL through intravenous fluids, and 75 inches in height. Output includes 2,600 mL of urine and 1,525 mL of stool, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -2,020 mL.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated potassium level of 5.2 K/uL, slightly low sodium level of 23 mEq/L, and slightly elevated chloride level of 141 mEq/L. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range. White blood cell count is slightly elevated, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are within normal range, and platelet count is normal.

The patient has been receiving various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. There are no known drug allergies.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of cocaine and alcohol abuse, presenting with suicidality in the setting of cocaine/etoh intoxication. He appears irritated but not anxious, with no tremor. His vital signs are stable, but he has a history of tachycardia that has resolved. The patient denies current suicide ideation but requires psychiatric admission when a bed is available. He may not leave against medical advice and will have a 1:1 sitter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient is likely detoxing from cocaine and appears irritated about being hospitalized. He has not required PRN Haldol, but restraints and Haldol may be needed if agitation worsens.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has resolved, but ongoing monitoring and supportive management with IV fluids as needed may be necessary.
3. Suicide ideation: The patient denies current suicide ideation, but he requires psychiatric admission when a bed is available. Close observation and a 1:1 sitter will be necessary to prevent any potential self-harm.
4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient previously had anion gap acidosis, which has resolved with bicarb 25. Ongoing monitoring of acid-base balance will be necessary.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has resolved after IV fluid resuscitation. Rechecking sodium"

s history and exam. Agree
   substantially with assessment and plan. We are working to provide an
   inpatient psychiatry hospital for his continuing severe depression and
   substance abuse.  Time spent 30 min
","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of cocaine and alcohol abuse, who presented with suicidality after intoxication. He is currently sober but remains agitated, experiencing tachycardia, and has suicidal ideation. The patient's anion gap acidosis and hypernatremia have resolved. He is being managed with supportive care, including IV fluids, and will require psychiatric admission when a bed becomes available. The patient's current condition is stable, with no known drug allergies, and he is receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Withdrawal symptoms: Given the patient's history of cocaine and alcohol abuse, he may experience withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, seizures, or delirium tremens.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to prolonged hospitalization and potential immunosuppression.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Despite receiving prophylactic treatment, there is still a risk of DVT formation due to immobilization.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient may develop stress ulcers due to the stress of hospitalization and underlying medical conditions.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): If the patient requires mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
6. Suicidal behavior: The patient's history of suicide attempts and current suicidal ideation pose a risk for self-harm if appropriate psychiatric care and supervision are not provided."
