","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia who presented for a diagnostic/interventional catheterization due to abnormal cardiac CT results. The CT scan revealed occluded mid-LAD and 70% proximal LAD stenosis, as well as mild disease in the LCX. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent placement in the mid-LAD and proximal LAD. Post-procedure, the patient received aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor. Due to a high dye load, the patient was given intravenous fluids. The patient experienced an episode in the cath lab requiring dopamine infusion, which may have been related to a possible vagal episode or vasodilation caused by a high dye load. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 97/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination shows a supple neck, no jugular venous distention, a palpable point of maximum intensity in the 5th intercostal space, and normal heart sounds. Lung examination reveals unlabored respirations with no accessory muscle use. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities have no crepitus"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia who presented for a diagnostic/interventional catheterization due to an abnormal cardiac CT scan. He was found to have occluded mid-LAD and 70% proximal LAD stenosis, as well as mild disease in the LCX. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) placed in the mid-LAD and proximal LAD, along with balloon angioplasty at the ostium of the diagonal branch.

The patient's post-catheterization echo showed normal findings with a preserved ejection fraction of 55%. He was determined to be euvolemic on examination. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension during the catheterization that resolved with the administration of dopamine. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear but may be related to a possible vagal episode in the setting of gastrointestinal upset or stomach full of air. Other potential causes include high dye load causing vasodilation/low body temperature.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 97/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His physical examination revealed a supple neck with a flat jugular venous pressure, point of maximum impulse located in the 5th intercostal space"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia who underwent a diagnostic/interventional catheterization due to abnormal cardiac CT findings. The patient was found to have LAD (left anterior descending) and LCX (left circumflex) artery disease and subsequently underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) placed in the mid LAD and proximal LAD.

The patient is currently being treated with aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, docusate sodium, and acetaminophen. The patient's thrombocytopenia was attributed to Integrilin, which has been stopped, and the patient received a platelet transfusion. The platelet count is trending up.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 98/51 mmHg, heart rate of 65 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he is well-nourished with no acute distress. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with regular rate and rhythm. Crackles are heard in both lung bases, indicating possible fluid accumulation. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. There is no peripheral edema or abnormal neurologic findings noted.

The patient's laboratory results show a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia who underwent a diagnostic/interventional catheterization due to abnormal cardiac CT findings. He was found to have lesions in the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (LCX) arteries and subsequently underwent stent placement in the LAD artery.

The patient is currently experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. This condition was attributed to the medication integrillin, which was stopped and the patient received a platelet transfusion. The platelet count is trending upward.

The patient also has anemia, with a hematocrit (HCT) level dropping from 38% to 29.6% within 24 hours. The patient is asymptomatic, but there are small hematomas at the groin sites and a possible lateral hip blood collection. Further evaluation will be done to determine if this is enough to explain the HCT drop. The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.4 g/dL, and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 90 mg/dL.

The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he no longer requires dopamine. However, he experienced an episode of hypotension in the cath lab that required dopamine infusion. The exact cause of this hypotension is unclear.

Other assessments include ongoing management for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), cardiac diet, and proph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia who presented for diagnostic/interventional catheterization due to abnormal cardiac CT findings. The patient underwent stent placement in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and left circumflex (LCX) artery. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing thrombocytopenia, which was secondary to Integrillin treatment. The patient's hemoglobin levels have also decreased, possibly due to bilateral hematomas and fluid collection in the left hip. The patient's blood pressure has improved and he is no longer on dopamine. He is asymptomatic at present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially experienced thrombocytopenia, which was secondary to Integrillin treatment. However, the patient's platelet count is now trending up slowly. The goal for discharge is to maintain a platelet count between 60-80 K/uL.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped with small bilateral hematomas and possible fluid collection in the left hip. Serial hematocrits have been stable, and the patient remains asymptomatic. Close monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin levels is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was initially low but has resolved, and the patient is no longer on dopamine.
4. OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea): The patient"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia who presented for a diagnostic/interventional catheterization due to abnormal cardiac CT findings. He was found to have disease in the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (LCX) arteries and subsequently underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) placed in the mid LAD and proximal LAD.

The patient has been experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is secondary to integrillin, and his platelet count has been trending up slowly. His hematocrit levels have also dropped, but they have been stable at 34.5 and 32.1% on two separate occasions. There are small bilateral hematomas present, along with possible fluid collection in the left hip. However, there is no evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed on the CT scan.

The patient's blood pressure has been relatively stable, and he has been weaned off dopamine. He continues to use CPAP at home for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). His diet is cardiac, and he has multiple peripheral intravenous (PIV) access lines.

The patient's active medications include acetaminophen, clopidogrel, aspirin, atorvastatin, docusate sodium, and potassium chloride. He is also receiving calcium gluconate through intravenous administration.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia who presented for a diagnostic/interventional catheterization due to abnormal cardiac CT results. The patient was found to have LAD and LCX disease and subsequently underwent a drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in the LAD.

In terms of the 24-hour events, the patient was stable. A CT scan was performed to evaluate the hematocrit drop and revealed moderate stranding localized to the presumed left-sided catheterization site, likely related to post-inflammatory stranding and disseminated hematoma. No discrete retroperitoneal hematoma was observed. Additionally, the CT scan showed multiple slightly irregular low-attenuating hepatic lesions, which were likely benign hepatic cysts. There was also a right renal simple cyst and small punctate nonobstructive bilateral renal calculi. Lastly, sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis was noted.

The afternoon labs demonstrated an improved hematocrit level of 34.5 (from 29.6) and platelet count of 48 (from 41). The patient has allergies to Integrilin (Intraven) (Eptifibatide) and thrombocytopenia. The last dose of antibiotics administered was not specified.

Regarding vital signs, the patient's maximum temperature recorded was 37.3°C (99.2°F), with the"
