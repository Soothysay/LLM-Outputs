   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -Start tube feeds today and follow up nutrition recommendations.
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control.

   - Consider bronch of RUL
   - Can optimize respiratory mechanics with thoracentesis and
   paracentesis. Check bladder pressure
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes

","Summary of Progress Note:

Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**], a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant (25 years ago), recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma, was admitted with peritonitis following an exploratory laparotomy. He is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient has multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia, including impaired ventilation-perfusion matching due to known stable right pleural effusion, ascites, and shunt from hepatopulmonary syndrome. New opacities on CT and new pleural effusion suggest possible pulmonary edema, which could be secondary to acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. There is concern for a pulmonary embolism, but without strong clinical evidence. Further evaluation is pending.

The patient's acid-base status shows a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap of ~1, likely representing anion gap from renal failure. This suggests compensatory hypercarbia, and an additional hypercarbia is present, leading to an increase in respiratory rate.

The patient's liver function is compromised due to chronic rejection post-liver transplant and chronic liver disease. He is currently on the transplant list. Prophylactic measures such as lactulose, ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -Start tube feeds today and follow up nutrition recommendations.
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory
   distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Patient has numerous reasons for
   baseline multifactorial hypoxia with A-A gradient. He has known
   shunting from hepatopulmonary syndrome, and also has V/Q mismatch from
   a large, stable left pleural effusion and ascites.  The patient's
   baseline PaO2 low 70s.  Given the patient's increased work of breathing
   and minute ventilation, this is concerning for increased Vd/Vt
   suggestive of either worsening V/Q mismatch from increased pulmonary
   edema or increased shunting from a pulmonary emboli, as the patient's
   hepatopulmonary syndrome, ascites, and pleural effusion appear stable
   contributing to decreased pulmonary reserve but likely not contributing
   to acute decompensation.  Increased pulmonary edema likely secondary to
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria in the setting of
   receiving volume. Pt intubated.
   - CVVH to take off fluid
   - Continued vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return - need ID
   approval
   - Consider bronch of RUL
   - Can optimize respiratory mechanics with thoracentesis and
   paracentesis. Check bladder pressure
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   .
   # Acid-base: Likely represents a chronic gap, non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with a delta gap of 1 and a HCO3 16.  pH currently stable,
   which is suggestive that his PCO2 is compensatory, although given his
   tachypnea currently an unchanged pH and PCO2 with increased minute
   ventilation would suggest an possible increased dead space fraction.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate
   .
   # Liver: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver transplant
   (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on transplant list.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
   - Continue prograf
   .
   # Renal: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute on
   sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   Discussed with transplant renal, plan for HD tonight.
   - Place HD line, HD today
   - Start HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   # Pleural effusion: Likely contralateral hepatohydrothorax given
   transudate on most recent thoracentesis.
   - Will need to consider thereapeutic thoracentesis in order to optimize
   respiratory mechanics
   - Diurese
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct [**Hospital1 **], transfuse hct<21.

   # Anisocoria: Non-contrast CTH to evaluate for acute intracranial
   pathology.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy and is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple comorbidities and is experiencing worsening hypoxia, respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, pleural effusion, anemia, and anisocoria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's hypoxia is due to multiple factors, including impaired ventilation-perfusion matching, shunting from known hepatopulmonary syndrome, and worsening pulmonary edema.
2) Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap of 0.75. The metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial, including anion gap from renal failure.
3) Renal Failure: The patient has acute on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis or hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated but stopped due to filter clotting, so hemodialysis (HD) will be started this morning.
4) Pleural Effusion: The patient has a hepatohydrothorax, which is a transudative effusion likely due to volume overload in the setting of renal failure. A therapeutic thoracentesis may be considered if needed to optimize respiratory mechanics.
5) Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia from liver and renal failure. He requires intermittent transfusions, and his hemoglobin concentration is stable at 26.7 g/dL.
6) Anisocoria: The patient has minimal anisocoria, which could be due to drug effects or another underlying cause. It is unclear if this is a new finding or a chronic condition.
7) Nutritional Support: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) due to respiratory distress, and nutrition consultation has been obtained for tube feeds.
8) Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving various prophylactic treatments, including stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prophylaxis.
9) Code Status: The patient has full code status.
10) Disposition: The patient is currently in the ICU level of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. -Was on cipro for SBP prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. -Was on cipro for SBP prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -Start tube feeds today and follow up nutrition recommendations.
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia who underwent a liver transplant 25 years ago. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and is currently intubated. The patient's medical history includes recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma.

From the note, it appears that the patient's hypoxic respiratory distress is due to multiple factors, including impaired ventilation-perfusion matching caused by known left pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites, as well as hepatopulmonary syndrome. The new right-sided opacities and pleural effusion suggest a possible pulmonary infection or increased pulmonary edema due to volume repletion in the setting of acute-on-subacute renal failure and oliguria. The patient has been started on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime empirically, and a bronchoscopy has been planned to identify possible organisms.

The patient also has a history of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and is currently experiencing acute-on-subacute renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was started last night but was"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory
   distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Patient has numerous reasons for
   baseline multifactorial hypoxia with A-A gradient. He has known
   shunting from hepatopulmonary syndrome, and also has V/Q mismatch from
   a large, stable left pleural effusion and ascites.  The patient's
   baseline PaO2 low 70s.  Given the patient's increased work of breathing
   and minute ventilation, this is concerning for increased Vd/Vt
   suggestive of either worsening V/Q mismatch from increased pulmonary
   edema or increased shunting from a pulmonary emboli, as the patient's
   hepatopulmonary syndrome, ascites, and pleural effusion appear stable
   contributing to decreased pulmonary reserve but likely not contributing
   to acute decompensation.  Increased pulmonary edema likely secondary to
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria in the setting of
   receiving volume. Pt intubated.
   - CVVH to take off fluid
   - Continued vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return - need ID
   approval
   - Consider bronch of RUL
   - Can optimize respiratory mechanics with thoracentesis and
   paracentesis. Check bladder pressure
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   .
   # Acid-base: Likely represents a chronic gap, non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with a delta gap of 1 and a HCO3 16.  pH currently stable,
   which is suggestive that his PCO2 is compensatory, although given his
   tachypnea currently an unchanged pH and PCO2 with increased minute
   ventilation would suggest an possible increased dead space fraction.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate
   .
   # Liver: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver transplant
   (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on transplant list.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
   - Continue prograf
   .
   # Renal: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute on
   sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   Discussed with transplant renal, plan for HD tonight.
   - Place HD line, HD today
   - Start HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   # Pleural effusion: Likely contralateral hepatohydrothorax given
   transudate on most recent thoracentesis.
   - Will need to consider thereapeutic thoracentesis in order to optimize
   respiratory mechanics
   - Diurese
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct [**Hospital1 **], transfuse hct<21.
   .
   # Anisocoria: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology. Unclear
   etiology; likely drug effect vs. physiologic anisocoria in the absence
   of findings on CT.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 30-year-old gentleman with a history of biliary atresia, post-liver transplant (25 years ago), and complications including recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis following an exploratory laparotomy and is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient has multiple reasons for baseline multifactorial hypoxia, including known shunting from hepato-pulmonary syndrome and V/Q mismatch due to a large, stable left pleural effusion and ascites. His baseline PaO2 is low at 70s. Given his increased work of breathing and minute ventilation, this suggests increased Vd/Vt, which may be due to worsening V/Q mismatch from increased pulmonary edema or increased shunting from pulmonary embolism. 

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. CVVH is being initiated to remove excess fluid. Antibiotics have been started, and further diagnostic workup is planned, including a bronchoscopic evaluation of the right upper lobe and a CT angiogram. Thoracentesis and paracentesis are being considered to optimize respiratory mechanics.

The patient's acid-base status is consistent with a chronic gap, non-gap metabolic acidosis with a delta gap of 1 and a HCO3- of 16. His"

   Assessment and Plan
   30 yom, s/p liver transplant (failed due to rejection) now with acute
   renal failure and respiratory failure.
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including acute volume overload
   in setting of acute on chronic renal failure, on backgroudn of
   pulmonary HTN, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt),
   and atalectasis due to abd distension.  Although CXR and Chest CT may
   reflect pulmonary edema and volume overload, need to consider
   infection/pneumonia in immunocompromised patient.  Plan continue
   dialysis for net diuresis.  Bronchoscopy to assess for pneumonia.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- may be due to pulmonary edema, but consider
   pneumonia.  Plan bronchsocpy to assess for infection, including
   opportunistic infection.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- ATN versus HRS type1.  Rx Midodrine and
   Octreotide, Albumin challenge as per Liver and Renal.  Continue CVVH,
   but may require conventional hemodialysis.
   FLUID -- net volume overload.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed to actue renal failure and lactic acidosis.
   Monitor on dialysis.
   LIVER FAILURE -- currently listed for liver transplant.  Lactulose and
   Cipro for prophylaxis
   ANEMIA -- attributed to renal failure, and possible contribution of
   medications.
   ANASACORIA --  stable.  Head CT WNL.  Monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 30-year-old male who underwent a liver transplant but experienced rejection and is now facing acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possibly heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is immunocompromised, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. This needs to be considered especially since the patient has pulmonary infiltrates. A plan includes bronchoscopy to assess for infection, including opportunistic infection, and empirical antimicrobials.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which could progress to AKI. The cause of the renal failure is uncertain between acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS). Treatment options include midodrine and octreotide, albumin challenge as per liver and renal guidelines, and continuing CVVH with the possibility of conventional hemodialysis.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a net volume overload, indicating an excess amount of fluid in the body. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema and increased pressure in the heart. The goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance.

4. Acidosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   30 yom, s/p liver transplant (failed due to rejection) now with acute
   renal failure and respiratory failure.
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including acute volume overload
   in setting of acute on chronic renal failure, on backgroudn of
   pulmonary HTN, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt),
   and atalectasis due to abd distension.  Although CXR and Chest CT may
   reflect pulmonary edema and volume overload, need to consider
   infection/pneumonia in immunocompromised patient.  Plan continue
   dialysis for net diuresis.  Bronchoscopy to assess for pneumonia.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- may be due to pulmonary edema, but consider
   pneumonia.  Plan bronchsocpy to assess for infection, including
   opportunistic infection.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- ATN versus HRS type1.  Rx Midodrine and
   Octreotide, Albumin challenge as per Liver and Renal.  Attempt to
   resume CVVH, but may require conventional hemodialysis.
   FLUID -- net volume overload.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed to actue renal failure and lactic acidosis.
   Monitor on dialysis.
   LIVER FAILURE -- currently listed for liver transplant.  Lactulose and
   Cipro for prophylaxis
   ANEMIA -- attributed to renal failure, and possible contribution of
   medications.
   ANASACORIA --  stable.  Head CT WNL.  Monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of liver transplant failure due to rejection. He is currently experiencing acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has volume overload, which may lead to pulmonary edema. This can be confirmed by chest X-ray and CT scan. Infection or pneumonia should also be considered, especially in an immunocompromised patient.

2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a risk of developing opportunistic infections, including pneumonia. A bronchoscopy may be necessary to assess for infection.

3. Hepatopulmonary syndrome: The patient's history of liver failure raises the possibility of hepatopulmonary syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal oxygen exchange in the lungs due to lung vascular dilatations. This can cause respiratory distress.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately. Dialysis may be required to remove waste products and maintain fluid balance.

5. Hepatic encephalopathy: With liver failure, the patient is at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, a condition where toxins build up in the brain due to impaired liver function. Symptoms can include confusion, altered mental status, and slurred speech.

6. Infection: As an immunocomprom"

   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on CRRT with rising TMP pressures.  The filter clotted
   within 15 min, his blood was given back to him.  The renal fellow was
   notified and he wanted to attempt HD so CRRT was disconnected.
   Action:
    HD was initiated at 1030 with the goal of getting 3liters.  His
   initial B/P was 114-120/70
s, HR 90
   Response:
    Only 1.2 liters were successfully removed during HD before his B/P
   fell to 90/60, HR 80
s.  He did received 1 unit of RBC
s during the
   treatment.  HD was terminated early with the plan to restart CRRT.
   75gms of albumin were given to help get fluid back in the veins and to
   help with blood pressure.  Following the albumin his pressure increased
   to 110/70
s.  CRRT was started at 1815 as planned using Heparin as
   anticoagulation.  He was bolused with 2000units of heparin at started
   on 500units/hr.  He has continued to have minimal amounts of urine
   during the day.
   Plan:
    He is starting off for the first hour net even with fluid removal,
   goal is 100cc/hr negative.
   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on fentanyl 300mcg/hr and midazolam 4mg/hr.  He was
   very sedated with minimal to no response to pain.
   Action:
    The fentanyl was decreased to 100mcg/hr and the midazolam was
   decreased to 2mg/hr.
   Response:
    He currently will have some withdrawal to painful stimuli and has some
   minimal spontaneous movements with activity.
   Plan:
    Maintain current level of sedation until he is closer to weaning off
   the vent.
   Alteration in Nutrition
   Assessment:
    OGT present and placement checked with aspiration of stomach contents,
   35cc of bili green fluid.
   Action:
    Tube feedings of novasource Renal was started at 12noon at 10cc/hr.
   He has hypoactive bowel sounds, no stool.
   Response:
    Residual at 1600 was 50cc, greater than the amount infused over the
   4hours the tube feedings were infusing.  Blood sugars have been in the
   80
s all day.  So tube feedings were stopped until absorption is
   confirmed.
   Plan:
    Monitor residuals and restart tube feedings when possible.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. -Was on cipro for SBP prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -Start tube feeds today and follow up nutrition recommendations.
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**], a 30-year-old man with a history of biliary atresia and liver transplant complicated by recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma, was admitted with peritonitis after an exploratory laparotomy. He is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and requires intubation.

The patient has multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia and increased work of breathing, including impaired ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to known stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites, as well as shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome. There is also worsening hypoxia with new right-sided opacities and new right pleural effusion, leading to V/Q mismatch, which is suspicious for pneumonia versus in addition to increased pulmonary edema from volume repletion in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure and oliguria. The concern for pulmonary embolism without strong clinical evidence has been deferred, pending the final read on the CT pulmonary angiography (LENS).

The patient's PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. His FiO2 has been reduced to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity. Weaning of FiO2 as tolerated, along with starting hemodialysis (HD) this morning, will be"

   Pt was adm to [**Hospital1 5**] [**6-11**] with N/V and hyperkalemia. Pt was also dx with
   SBP. Abd CT showed free fluid to SB and pt had an exp lap done with
   bowel resection and JP placement. JP drained 1 liter qday and DC'd [**6-27**].
   Pt developed fevers post removal. Pt was on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 10, followed by Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] for work up for liver transplant.  Meanwhile, pt developed fluid
   overload and was diuresed. Pt developed worsening renal function and ?

   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Assessment:
    Pt maintained on A/C 400 x 24, Peep 5, FiO2 dropped to 30% with O2
   sats 95-96%.  This am breath sounds clear on the left and with lots of
   rhonchi  on the right.
   Action:
    Specimens sent for culture over night were deemed not good samples and
   suctioning pt did not yield any better specimens.  Pt was bronked at
   1330 for culture specimens.
   Response:
    Following the [**Last Name (un) 1924**] his breath sounds were much clearer on the left
   side.
   Plan:
    Continue to monitor resp status, suction PRN
   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on CRRT with rising TMP pressures.  The filter clotted
   within 15 min, his blood was given back to him.  The renal fellow was
   notified and he wanted to attempt HD so CRRT was disconnected.
   Action:
    HD was initiated at 1030 with the goal of getting 3liters.  His
   initial B/P was 114-120/70
s, HR 90
   Response:
    Only 1.2 liters were successfully removed during HD before his B/P
   fell to 90/60, HR 80
s.  He did received 1 unit of RBC
s during the
   treatment.  HD was terminated early with the plan to restart CRRT.
   75gms of albumin were given to help get fluid back in the veins and to
   help with blood pressure.  Following the albumin his pressure increased
   to 110/70
s.  CRRT was started at 1815 as planned using Heparin as
   anticoagulation.  He was bolused with 2000units of heparin at started
   on 500units/hr.  He has continued to have minimal amounts of urine
   during the day.
   Plan:
    He is starting off for the first hour net even with fluid removal,
   goal is 100cc/hr negative.
   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on fentanyl 300mcg/hr and midazolam 4mg/hr.  He was
   very sedated with minimal to no response to pain.
   Action:
    The fentanyl was decreased to 100mcg/hr and the midazolam was
   decreased to 2mg/hr.
   Response:
    He currently will have some withdrawal to painful stimuli and has some
   minimal spontaneous movements with activity.
   Plan:
    Maintain current level of sedation until he is closer to weaning off
   the vent.
   Alteration in Nutrition
   Assessment:
    OGT present and placement checked with aspiration of stomach contents,
   35cc of bili green fluid.
   Action:
    Tube feedings of novasource Renal was started at 12noon at 10cc/hr.
   He has hypoactive bowel sounds, no stool.
   Response:
    Residual at 1600 was 50cc, greater than the amount infused over the
   4hours the tube feedings were infusing.  Blood sugars have been in the
   80

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. -Was on cipro for SBP prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -Start tube feeds today and follow up nutrition recommendations.
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**], a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia and liver transplant, is admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress. He has a background of recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy due to peritonitis and was found to have a bowel resection with the placement of a Jackson-Pratt drain. He developed fevers post-procedure and was diagnosed with small bowel perforation. The patient was previously on non-invasive ventilation, but required intubation last night. 

Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient has a baseline low PaO2 likely due to impaired V/Q mismatch from stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites. Worsening hypoxia is attributed to new right-sided opacities and right pleural effusion, which may indicate pneumonia or worsening pulmonary edema due to volume repletion in the setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure and oliguria. A bronchoscopy was performed to identify possible organisms, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime. 
2) Acidosis: The patient has mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a"

   Pt was adm to [**Hospital1 5**] [**6-11**] with N/V and hyperkalemia. Pt was also dx with
   SBP. Abd CT showed free fluid to SB and pt had an exp lap done with
   bowel resection and JP placement. JP drained 1 liter qday and DC'd [**6-27**].
   Pt developed fevers post removal. Pt was on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 10, followed by Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] for work up for liver transplant.  Meanwhile, pt developed fluid
   overload and was diuresed. Pt developed worsening renal function and ?
   ATN ? [**12-27**]  diuresing. CXR showed Lt pleural effusion with LLL collapse.
   Thoracenthesis done and fluid has now re-accumilated. Today, pt dev
   acute resp distress and was adm to MICU with resp distress, RF
   (creatine 3.6) and fluid over load.
   Events:   *CRRT clotted at  7:15a
   *HD attempted

   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Assessment:
    Pt maintained on A/C 400 x 24, Peep 5, FiO2 dropped to 30% with O2
   sats 95-96%.  This am breath sounds clear on the left and with lots of
   rhonchi  on the right.
   Action:
    Specimens sent for culture over night were deemed not good samples and
   suctioning pt did not yield any better specimens.  Pt was bronked at
   1330 for culture specimens.
   Response:
    Following the [**Last Name (un) 1924**] his breath sounds were much clearer on the left
   side.
   Plan:
    Continue to monitor resp status, suction PRN
   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on CRRT with rising TMP pressures.  The filter clotted
   within 15 min, his blood was given back to him.  The renal fellow was
   notified and he wanted to attempt HD so CRRT was disconnected.
   Action:
    HD was initiated at 1030 with the goal of getting 3liters.  His
   initial B/P was 114-120/70
s, HR 90
   Response:
    Only 1.2 liters were successfully removed during HD before his B/P
   fell to 90/60, HR 80
s.  He did received 1 unit of RBC
s during the
   treatment.  HD was terminated early with the plan to restart CRRT.
   75gms of albumin were given to help get fluid back in the veins and to
   help with blood pressure.  Following the albumin his pressure increased
   to 110/70
s.  CRRT was started at 1815 as planned using Heparin as
   anticoagulation.  He was bolused with 2000units of heparin at started
   on 500units/hr.  He has continued to have minimal amounts of urine
   during the day.
   Plan:
    He is starting off for the first hour net even with fluid removal,
   goal is 100cc/hr negative.
   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on fentanyl 300mcg/hr and midazolam 4mg/hr.  He was
   very sedated with minimal to no response to pain.
   Action:
    The fentanyl was decreased to 100mcg/hr and the midazolam was
   decreased to 2mg/hr.
   Response:
    He currently will have some withdrawal to painful stimuli and has some
   minimal spontaneous movements with activity.
   Plan:
    Maintain current level of sedation until he is closer to weaning off
   the vent.
   Alteration in Nutrition
   Assessment:
    OGT present and placement checked with aspiration of stomach contents,
   35cc of bili green fluid.
   Action:
    Tube feedings of novasource Renal was started at 12noon at 10cc/hr.
   He has hypoactive bowel sounds, no stool.
   Response:
    Residual at 1600 was 50cc, greater than the amount infused over the
   4hours the tube feedings were infusing.  Blood sugars have been in the
   80
s all day.  So tube feedings were stopped until absorption is
   confirmed.
   Plan:
    Monitor residuals and restart tube feedings when possible.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. -Was on cipro for SBP prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -Start tube feeds today and follow up nutrition recommendations.
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia post liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted for peritonitis after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy and is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently on various medications including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. He also requires dialysis due to acute on chronic renal failure.

From the assessment and plan section, the following potential medical complications can be identified:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient has a baseline low PaO2 due to impaired ventilation-perfusion matching caused by known stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is also suspicion of pneumonia versus in addition to increased pulmonary edema from volume repletion in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation, so the FiO2 can be reduced to 30 to minimize the risk of oxygen toxicity.

2. Acidosis: The patient has mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap of 0.75. This may be multifactorial but likely includes anion gap from renal failure. The patient's PaCO2 is 45,"

   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Assessment:
    Pt maintained on A/C 400 x 24, Peep 5, FiO2 dropped to 30% with O2
   sats 95-96%.  This am breath sounds clear on the left and with lots of
   rhonchi  on the right.
   Action:
    Specimens sent for culture over night were deemed not good samples and
   suctioning pt did not yield any better specimens.  Pt was bronked at
   1330 for culture specimens.
   Response:
    Following the [**Last Name (un) 1924**] his breath sounds were much clearer on the left
   side.
   Plan:
    Continue to monitor resp status, suction PRN
   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on CRRT with rising TMP pressures.  The filter clotted
   within 15 min, his blood was given back to him.  The renal fellow was
   notified and he wanted to attempt HD so CRRT was disconnected.
   Action:
    HD was initiated at 1030 with the goal of getting 3liters.  His
   initial B/P was 114-120/70
s, HR 90
   Response:
    Only 1.2 liters were successfully removed during HD before his B/P
   fell to 90/60, HR 80
s.  He did received 1 unit of RBC
s during the
   treatment.  HD was terminated early with the plan to restart CRRT.
   75gms of albumin were given to help get fluid back in the veins and to
   help with blood pressure.  Following the albumin his pressure increased
   to 110/70
s.  CRRT was started at 1815 as planned using Heparin as
   anticoagulation.  He was bolused with 2000units of heparin at started
   on 500units/hr.  He has continued to have minimal amounts of urine
   during the day.
   Plan:
    He is starting off for the first hour net even with fluid removal,
   goal is 100cc/hr negative.
   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on fentanyl 300mcg/hr and midazolam 4mg/hr.  He was
   very sedated with minimal to no response to pain.
   Action:
    The fentanyl was decreased to 100mcg/hr and the midazolam was
   decreased to 2mg/hr.
   Response:
    He currently will have some withdrawal to painful stimuli and has some
   minimal spontaneous movements with activity.
   Plan:
    Maintain current level of sedation until he is closer to weaning off
   the vent.
   Alteration in Nutrition
   Assessment:
    OGT present and placement checked with aspiration of stomach contents,
   35cc of bili green fluid.
   Action:
    Tube feedings of novasource Renal was started at 12noon at 10cc/hr.
   He has hypoactive bowel sounds, no stool.
   Response:
    Residual at 1600 was 50cc, greater than the amount infused over the
   4hours the tube feedings were infusing.  Blood sugars have been in the
   80
s all day.  So tube feedings were stopped until absorption is
   confirmed.
   Plan:
    Monitor residuals and restart tube feedings when possible.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. -Was on cipro for SBP prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -Start tube feeds today and follow up nutrition recommendations.
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control.

   Following = #[**Numeric Identifier 1312**]
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including acute volume overload
   in setting of acute on chronic renal failure, on backgroudn of
   pulmonary HTN, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt),
   and atalectasis due to abd distension.  Although CXR and Chest CT may
   reflect pulmonary edema and volume overload, need to consider
   infection/pneumonia in immunocompromised patient.  Plan continue
   dialysis for net diuresis.  Bronchoscopy to assess for pneumonia.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- may be due to pulmonary edema, but consider
   pneumonia.  Plan bronchsocpy to assess for infection, including
   opportunistic infection.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- ATN versus HRS type1.  Rx Midodrine and
   Octreotide, Albumin challenge as per Liver and Renal.  Attempt to
   resume CVVH, but may require conventional hemodialysis.
   FLUID -- net volume overload.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed to actue renal failure and lactic acidosis.
   Monitor on dialysis.
   LIVER FAILURE -- currently listed for liver transplant.  Lactulose and
   Cipro for prophylaxis
   ANEMIA -- attributed to renal failure, and possible contribution of
   medications.
   ANASACORIA --  stable.  Head CT WNL.  Monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30-year-old male with a medical history of biliary atresia, post-liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis after exploratory laparotomy and is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient has a history of chronic hypoxia with an altered arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) likely due to impaired ventilation-perfusion matching caused by pleural effusion and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Worsening hypoxia is attributed to new right-sided opacities and pleural effusion, which could be due to pneumonia or pulmonary edema secondary to fluid overload in the setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Acidosis: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap of 0.75 is observed. The metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial, including anion gap from renal failure. There is compensatory hypercarbia, so the respiratory rate was increased from 20 to 24.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of recurrent cirrhosis post-liver transplant. He is currently"

   suctioning pt did not yield any better specimens.  Pt was bronked at
   1330 for culture specimens.
   Response:
    Following the [**Last Name (un) 1924**] his breath sounds were much clearer on the left
   side.
   Plan:
    Continue to monitor resp status, suction PRN
   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on CRRT with rising TMP pressures.  The filter clotted
   within 15 min, his blood was given back to him.  The renal fellow was
   notified and he wanted to attempt HD so CRRT was disconnected.
   Action:
    HD was initiated at 1030 with the goal of getting 3liters.  His
   initial B/P was 114-120/70
s, HR 90
   Response:
    Only 1.2 liters were successfully removed during HD before his B/P
   fell to 90/60, HR 80
s.  He did received 1 unit of RBC
s during the
   treatment.  HD was terminated early with the plan to restart CRRT.
   75gms of albumin were given to help get fluid back in the veins and to
   help with blood pressure.  Following the albumin his pressure increased
   to 110/70
s.  CRRT was started at 1815 as planned using Heparin as
   anticoagulation.  He was bolused with 2000units of heparin at started
   on 500units/hr.  He has continued to have minimal amounts of urine
   during the day.
   Plan:
    He is starting off for the first hour net even with fluid removal,
   goal is 100cc/hr negative.
   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
   Assessment:
    Pt was received on fentanyl 300mcg/hr and midazolam 4mg/hr.  He was
   very sedated with minimal to no response to pain.
   Action:
    The fentanyl was decreased to 100mcg/hr and the midazolam was
   decreased to 2mg/hr.
   Response:
    He currently will have some withdrawal to painful stimuli and has some
   minimal spontaneous movements with activity.
   Plan:
    Maintain current level of sedation until he is closer to weaning off
   the vent.
   Alteration in Nutrition
   Assessment:
    OGT present and placement checked with aspiration of stomach contents,
   35cc of bili green fluid.
   Action:
    Tube feedings of novasource Renal was started at 12noon at 10cc/hr.
   He has hypoactive bowel sounds, no stool.
   Response:
    Residual at 1600 was 50cc, greater than the amount infused over the
   4hours the tube feedings were infusing.  Blood sugars have been in the
   80
s all day.  So tube feedings were stopped until absorption is
   confirmed.
   Plan:
    Monitor residuals and restart tube feedings when possible.

- Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**], a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma, was admitted for peritonitis following an exploratory laparotomy.
- He developed hypoxic respiratory distress and was transferred to the MICU.
- The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, and has had various lines placed, including a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line.
- He has a history of acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and alterations in nutrition.
- The patient is currently maintained on assisted ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and spontaneous respiratory efforts are absent.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/73 to 135/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, total bilirubin, and liver enzymes. The patient's"

   24 Hour Events:
 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2135-7-16**] 01:45 PM
   HD was attempted with goal to remove 3L however pt dropped BPs to
   systolic of 90s after 1.2 L. Pt got albumin, 1 U PRBC with
   normalization of BP to 110. Switched from HD to CRRT with heparin
   anticoagulation. and continued to produce mininmum urine through the
   day.
   Poor culture data obtained from suctioning thus pt had bronchoscopy for
   culture specimens with improved breath sounds post bronchoscopy.
   Tube feeds were held given high resideulas to 50cc (flow rate 10cc/hr)
   Respiratory wise weaned from FI02 50% to 30%  becoming hypoxic
   7.30/41/79/21 to 7.31/41/65/22.
   FI02 increased to 40% with improvement of his 02 sat 7.29/40/96/20 with

   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Worsening hypoxia with new R-sided opacities and new R pleural
   effusion leading to VQ mismatch, suspicious for PNA vs/in addition to
   increased pulmonary edema  from volume repletion in the setting of
   acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria. Original concern for PE
   without strong clinical evidence. Final read on LENIS pending. Started
   on vanc.cipro/cefepime due to new opacities.  In order to identify
   possible organisms, a bronchoscopy today.
   *Given concern for volume overload in setting of renal failure, CVVH
   was started overnight. Due to clotting off of filter, HD will be
   started this AM, with goal of net negative fluid balance.
   *His PaO2 has improved overnight on intubation. Last PaO2 was 117, so
   we can reduce FiO2 to 30 to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - HD this AM.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Defer PE work-up or CTA for now. Follow-up final read on LENIs, tech
   note was negative for occlusive thrombus.
   - Repeat ABG's for vent or clinical changes
   2) ACIDOSIS: Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap
   0.75.  Metabolic acidosis may be multifactorial but likely includes
   anion gap from renal failure. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**] formula predicts PaCO2 of 38, his
   is 45, suggesting that he likely has compensatory hypercarbia and an
   additional respiratory hypercarbia, so RR was appropriately increased
   this AM from 20 to 24.
   - Recheck lytes and ABG
   - Check lactate.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. -Was on cipro for SBP prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - Continue lactulose.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Start HD this AM.
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP.
   .
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Pending HD,
   consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed to optimize respiratory
   mechanics.
   - Continue HD.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -Start tube feeds today and follow up nutrition recommendations.
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control.

   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including acute volume overload
   in setting of acute on chronic renal failure, on backgroudn of
   pulmonary HTN, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt),
   and atalectasis due to abd distension.  Although CXR and Chest CT may
   reflect pulmonary edema and volume overload, need to consider
   infection/pneumonia in immunocompromised patient.  Plan continue
   dialysis for net diuresis.  Bronchoscopy to assess for pneumonia.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- may be due to pulmonary edema, but consider
   pneumonia.  Plan bronchsocpy to assess for infection, including
   opportunistic infection.  Empirical antimicrobials.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- ATN versus HRS type1.  Rx Midodrine and
   Octreotide, Albumin challenge as per Liver and Renal.  Attempt to
   resume CVVH, but may require conventional hemodialysis.
   FLUID -- net volume overload.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed to actue renal failure and lactic acidosis.
   Monitor on dialysis.
   LIVER FAILURE -- currently listed for liver transplant.  Lactulose and
   Cipro for prophylaxis
   ANEMIA -- attributed to renal failure, and possible contribution of
   medications.
   ANASACORIA --  stable.  Head CT WNL.  Monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia post liver transplant, complicated by recurrent cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis and underwent an exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap). He is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and requires intubation.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory distress due to multiple factors such as impaired ventilation-perfusion mismatch, pleural effusion, atelectasis, and potential pneumonia. He also has acidosis, likely secondary to acute renal failure and lactic acidosis. The patient has a history of chronic liver failure, currently listed for liver transplantation, and is on prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has acute on chronic renal failure, requiring hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's worsening hypoxia is multifactorial, including impaired V/Q mismatch, pleural effusion, atelectasis, and potential pneumonia. It is essential to optimize respiratory support, reduce FiO2 to minimize oxygen toxicity, and consider therapeutic thoracentesis if needed.
2. Acidosis: The patient has mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Close monitoring of ABG and electrolytes"

 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2135-7-16**] 01:45 PM
   HD was attempted with goal to remove 3L however pt dropped BPs to
   systolic of 90s after 1.2 L. Pt got albumin, 1 U PRBC with
   normalization of BP to 110. Switched from HD to CRRT with heparin
   anticoagulation. and continued to produce mininmum urine through the
   day.
   Poor culture data obtained from suctioning thus pt had bronchoscopy for
   culture specimens with improved breath sounds post bronchoscopy.
   Tube feeds were held given high resideulas to 50cc (flow rate 10cc/hr)
   Respiratory wise weaned from FI02 50% to 30%  becoming hypoxic
   7.30/41/79/21 to 7.31/41/65/22.
   FI02 increased to 40% with improvement of his 02 sat 7.29/40/96/20 with

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma.
- He was admitted with peritonitis and underwent exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap).
- The patient is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
- He experienced hemodynamic instability during hemodialysis (HD) and was switched to continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- The patient has poor culture data, and bronchoscopy was performed to obtain culture specimens.
- He is currently receiving tube feeds but with a slow flow rate due to high resistance.
- The patient's oxygen saturation improved after increasing FiO2 to 40%.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on several medications.
- His vital signs are within normal limits, except for low blood pressure.
- The patient has mild crackles in the anterior chest on physical examination.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress, which can be due to various causes such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or worsening of underlying lung diseases like hepatopulmonary syndrome or asthma. Close monitoring of oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis and underwent an exploratory laparotomy. The patient is now in the MICU due to hypoxic respiratory distress. He has been receiving various treatments, including hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), bronchoscopy, and tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition indicates acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. It is essential to monitor his oxygen saturation levels and adjust ventilator settings accordingly.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, also known as acute kidney injury (AKI). Close monitoring of his kidney function through laboratory tests, such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), is necessary. Additionally, the patient is undergoing CRRT to manage his renal function.
3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has liver dysfunction, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal bilirubin levels. Monitoring liver function tests regularly is crucial to assess the patient's hepatic status.
4. Infection: The patient has been exposed to multiple antibiotics, suggesting a risk of infection. Regular assessment of vital signs,"

   systolic of 90s after 1.2 L. Pt got albumin, 1 U PRBC with
   normalization of BP to 110. Switched from HD to CRRT with heparin
   anticoagulation. and continued to produce mininmum urine through the
   day.
   Poor culture data obtained from suctioning thus pt had bronchoscopy for
   culture specimens with improved breath sounds post bronchoscopy.
   Tube feeds were held given high resideulas to 50cc (flow rate 10cc/hr)
   Respiratory wise weaned from FI02 50% to 30%  becoming hypoxic
   7.30/41/79/21 to 7.31/41/65/22.
   FI02 increased to 40% with improvement of his 02 sat 7.29/40/96/20 with
   no further

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   today.
   Pulmonary edema onCXR improved with CVP down after HD/CCVH. Hypoxia on
   ABG worsened in setting of weaning FI02 from 50 to 30%, however still
   in nl range, back to 90s on increasing FI02 to 40s.
   Continue attempt wean FI02 to protect 02 radical damage.  Goal Pa02
   60-80
   CXR shows large LLL pleural effusion, cannot rule out retrocardiac
   opacity, ? PNA in severely immunocompromised, at risk host.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - f/[**Location 134**] read LENIs, low suspicion currently for PE, particularly
   in face of improvement radiographically, just with HD/CVVH.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Meld score today 30. -Was on cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - No BM since admission. Continue lactulose.
   - Continue to check LFTS/ calc meld score for transplant.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Continue CCVH,  HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine,
   octreotide.
   -Goal off 2-3 L with CVVH.
    Trend creatinine, UOP, monitor vitals.
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Given
   improvement with HD, CVVH, no thoracentesis at this time.
   - Continue CVVH.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM at 26.9
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -On tube feeds, holding for high residuals. Had been hypoglycemic in
   setting tube feeds held. Resumed currently.
   -Continue feeds, continue lactulose. No BM since admission to ICU.
   Continue ISS for glycemic control if hyperglycemic, GFS q4.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, post liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis and underwent an exploratory laparotomy. He is now in the MICU due to hypoxic respiratory distress and requires intubation.

The patient's recent events include a bronchoscopy to remove secretions, which resulted in hypotension and required intervention with albumin and packed red blood cells. He was switched from hemodialysis (HD) to continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with heparin anticoagulation. Tube feeds were held due to high residuals, and his respiratory support was weaned from 50% FiO2 to 30% FiO2, leading to hypoxia. His oxygen saturation improved with an increase in FiO2 to 40%.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/60 mmHg to 141/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination reveals mild crackles through the anterior chest.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   30 yom, s/p liver transplant (failed due to rejection) now with acute
   renal failure and respiratory failure.
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including acute volume overload
   in setting of acute on chronic renal failure, on backgroudn of
   pulmonary HTN, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt),
   and atalectasis due to abd distension.  Await bronchscopy results to
   assess for pneumonia.   Plan continue dialysis for net diuresis.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2, maintain SaO2 >90%.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- may be due to pulmonary edema (cardiogenic vs.
   non-cardiogenic), but consider pneumonia.  Plan bronchscopy to assess
   for infection, including opportunistic infection.  Empirical
   antimicrobials.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- ATN versus HRS type1.  Rx Midodrine and
   Octreotide, Albumin challenge as per Liver and Renal.  Continue CVVH.
   FLUID -- net volume overload.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   towards dry weight.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed to actue renal failure and lactic acidosis.
   Monitor on dialysis.
   LIVER FAILURE -- currently listed for liver transplant.  Lactulose and
   Cipro for prophylaxis
   ANEMIA -- attributed to renal failure, and possible contribution of
   medications.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiated TF
 initially high residuals.
   Increasing slowly.

","The patient is a 30-year-old male who underwent a liver transplant that failed due to rejection. He is currently experiencing acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension. The plan is to continue dialysis for net diuresis, mechanical ventilation, and monitor ABG, SaO2, maintaining SaO2 >90%. The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates, which may be due to pulmonary edema (cardiogenic vs. non-cardiogenic), but consideration should be given to pneumonia. A bronchoscopy will be performed to assess for infection, including opportunistic infection, and empirical antimicrobials will be administered. The patient's acute renal failure is attributed to either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Midodrine and octreotide will be prescribed, along with an albumin challenge as per liver and renal guidelines. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) will be continued. The patient has a net volume overload and desires a net negative fluid balance towards dry weight. Acidosis is attributed to acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, and will be monitored during dialysis. The patient is currently listed for a liver transplant and will receive"

 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities c/w PNA vs. pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. Stable but acidemic ABG on
   FiO2 of 40%. Because of difficulties with CVVH, we were unable to
   attain negative fluid balance. Thus the first step to optimizing
   respiratory status is to continue CVVH with net -2L goal for today.
   FiO2 can be weaned as tolerated given high PaO2. In the coming day(s),
   PSV can be attempted if negative fluid balance goal and clinical
   picture allow.
   *Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Delta gap: 2.7. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**]
   predicts PaCO2 of 35.5, actual is 37. Vt is limited in this small
   patient, and RR is already 24, so changes in these variables are not
   preferable.
   * Day 2 of vanc/cefepime/cipro. Prelim BAL cx was negative, so if final
   read is negative, we can likely discontinue abx if his respiratory
   status remains stable to improved, since his respiratory failure is
   likely due to pulmonary edema if no infection is identified.
   -Continue CCVH this AM with goal of fluid balance of -2L/24Hr.
   -Continue attempt wean.  Goal Pa02 60-80
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Follow up official read LENIs, but there low suspicion currently for
   PE, particularly in face of improvement radiographically with HD/CVVH.
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals, and no BM
   since [**7-15**]. On bowel regimen. KUB with no evidence of obstruction,
   large amount of stool in colon. Ddx includes decreased motility in the
   setting of medications vs. increased intrabdominal pressure leading to
   ileus. Abd US today to rule out abdominal ascites (RUQ US did not
   comment on ascites) and bladder pressure assessment to rule out bladder
   contribution to increased abdominal pressure. No enema today given CVVH
   but administer if BM not achieved today.
   -Abdominal US for ascites.
   -Measure bladder pressure.
   -Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
   -Continue Reglan IV PRN nausea.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Prograf levels low today. Was on cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP; if D/C cipro per above, will need to
   restart cipro at SBP levels.
   - No BM since admission. Continue lactulose.
   - Continue to check LFTS/ calc meld score for transplant.
   - Contact [**Name (NI) **] and liver teams regarding preferred mode of
   administration and dose to increase level.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Continue CCVH, with goal of fluid balance of -2L/24Hr, per above.
   -Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   -Goal off 2-3 L with CVVH.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP, monitor vitals.
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Given
   improvement with HD, CVVH, no thoracentesis at this time. Will reassess
   if resp status not improved with CVVH.
   - Continue CVVH.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM at 26.9
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -On tube feeds, holding for high residuals. Resume as tolerated
   following BM.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control if hyperglycemic, GFS q4.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30-year-old male with a medical history of biliary atresia, liver transplant (25 years ago), recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis following an exploratory laparotomy and is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress, requiring intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient has multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia and increased work of breathing. These include impaired ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to stable right pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites. Additionally, shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome contributes to the hypoxia. The patient's ABG shows mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with a delta gap of 2.7. The initial step to optimize respiratory status is to continue continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a goal of fluid balance of -2 liters per day. FiO2 can be weaned as tolerated given the high PaO2. In the coming days, pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) can be attempted if a negative fluid balance goal and clinical picture allow.

2. GI Dysmotility: The patient presents with abdominal distention, tube feed residuals,"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities c/w PNA vs. pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. Stable but acidemic ABG on
   FiO2 of 40%. Because of difficulties with CVVH, we were unable to
   attain negative fluid balance. Thus the first step to optimizing
   respiratory status is to continue CVVH with net -2L goal for today.
   FiO2 can be weaned as tolerated given high PaO2. In the coming day(s),
   PSV can be attempted if negative fluid balance goal and clinical
   picture allow.
   *Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Delta gap: 2.7. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**]
   predicts PaCO2 of 35.5, actual is 37. Vt is limited in this small
   patient, and RR is already 24, so changes in these variables are not
   preferable.
   * Day 2 of vanc/cefepime/cipro. Prelim BAL cx was negative, so if final
   read is negative, we can likely discontinue abx if his respiratory
   status remains stable to improved, since his respiratory failure is
   likely due to pulmonary edema if no infection is identified.
   -Continue CCVH this AM with goal of fluid balance of -2L/24Hr.
   -Continue attempt wean FI02 to protect 02 radical damage.  Goal Pa02
   60-80
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Follow up official read LENIs, but there low suspicion currently for
   PE, particularly in face of improvement radiographically with HD/CVVH.
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals, and no BM
   since [**7-15**]. On bowel regimen. KUB with no evidence of obstruction,
   large amount of stool in colon. Ddx includes decreased motility in the
   setting of medications vs. increased intrabdominal pressure leading to
   ileus. Abd US today to rule out abdominal ascites (RUQ US did not
   comment on ascites) and bladder pressure assessment to rule out bladder
   contribution to increased abdominal pressure. No enema today given CVVH
   but administer if BM not achieved today.
   -Abdominal US for ascites.
   -Measure bladder pressure.
   -Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
   -Continue Reglan IV PRN nausea.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Prograf levels low today. Was on cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP; if D/C cipro per above, will need to
   restart cipro at SBP levels.
   - No BM since admission. Continue lactulose.
   - Continue to check LFTS/ calc meld score for transplant.
   - Contact [**Name (NI) **] and liver teams regarding preferred mode of
   administration and dose to increase level.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Continue CCVH, with goal of fluid balance of -2L/24Hr, per above.
   -Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   -Goal off 2-3 L with CVVH.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP, monitor vitals.
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Given
   improvement with HD, CVVH, no thoracentesis at this time. Will reassess
   if resp status not improved with CVVH.
   - Continue CVVH.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM at 26.9
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -On tube feeds, holding for high residuals. Resume as tolerated
   following BM.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control if hyperglycemic, GFS q4.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities c/w PNA vs. pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. Stable but acidemic ABG on
   FiO2 of 40%. Because of difficulties with CVVH, we were unable to
   attain negative fluid balance. Thus the first step to optimizing
   respiratory status is to continue CVVH with net -2L goal for today.
   FiO2 can be weaned as tolerated given high PaO2. In the coming day(s),
   PSV can be attempted if negative fluid balance goal and clinical
   picture allow.
   *Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Delta gap: 2.7. [**Doctor Last Name 6492**]
   predicts PaCO2 of 35.5, actual is 37. Vt is limited in this small
   patient, and RR is already 24, so changes in these variables are not
   preferable.
   * Day 2 of vanc/cefepime/cipro. Prelim BAL cx was negative, so if final
   read is negative, we can likely discontinue abx if his respiratory
   status remains stable to improved, since his respiratory failure is
   likely due to pulmonary edema if no infection is identified.
   -Continue CCVH this AM with goal of fluid balance of -2L/24Hr.
   -Continue attempt wean.  Goal Pa02 60-80
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - Follow up official read LENIs, but there low suspicion currently for
   PE, particularly in face of improvement radiographically with HD/CVVH.
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals, and no BM
   since [**7-15**]. On bowel regimen. KUB with no evidence of obstruction,
   large amount of stool in colon. Ddx includes decreased motility in the
   setting of medications vs. increased intrabdominal pressure leading to
   ileus. Abd US today to rule out abdominal ascites (RUQ US did not
   comment on ascites) and bladder pressure assessment to rule out bladder
   contribution to increased abdominal pressure. No enema today given CVVH
   but administer if BM not achieved today.
   -Abdominal US for ascites.
   -Measure bladder pressure.
   -Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
   -Continue Reglan IV PRN nausea.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Prograf levels low today. Was on cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP; if D/C cipro per above, will need to
   restart cipro at SBP levels.
   - No BM since admission. Continue lactulose.
   - Continue to check LFTS/ calc meld score for transplant.
   - Contact [**Name (NI) **] and liver teams regarding preferred mode of
   administration and dose to increase level.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Continue CCVH, with goal of fluid balance of -2L/24Hr, per above.
   -Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   -Goal off 2-3 L with CVVH.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP, monitor vitals.
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Given
   improvement with HD, CVVH, no thoracentesis at this time. Will reassess
   if resp status not improved with CVVH.
   - Continue CVVH.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM at 26.9
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.

","Summary:
- 30-year-old male with biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma admitted with peritonitis and respiratory distress requiring intubation.
- Current concerns include hypoxic respiratory distress, GI dysmotility, cirrhosis, renal failure, pleural effusion, anemia, anisocoria, and nutrition.
- The patient is on CVVH with a goal of achieving a negative fluid balance of -2L/24Hr.
- FiO2 can be weaned as tolerated given high PaO2. PSV can be attempted if negative fluid balance goal and clinical picture allow.
- Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal dosing.
- Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
- Follow up official read LENIs, but there is low suspicion currently for PE, particularly in the face of improvement radiographically with HD/CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's underlying conditions, such as hepato-pulmonary syndrome and porto-pulmonary hypertension, can worsen the respiratory distress and lead to further hypoxia.
2. GI dysmotility: The patient's abdominal distention, TF residuals, and lack"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities c/w PNA vs. Pulmonary edema on CXR
   improved/stable with CVP down after HD/CCVH. Stable but academic ABG on
   FiO2 of 40%.
   * Day 2 of vanc/cefepime/cipro
   -Continue attempt wean FI02 to protect 02 radical damage.  Goal Pa02
   60-80
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - f/[**Location 134**] read LENIs, low suspicion currently for PE, particularly
   in face of improvement radiographically, just with HD/CVVH.
    2) ABDOMINAL DISTENTION/TF RESIDUALS: Continues to not have BM. On
   bowel regimen.
   -Enema and standing bowel regimen until BM.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Meld score today 30. -Was on cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - No BM since admission. Continue lactulose.
   - Continue to check LFTS/ calc meld score for transplant.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Continue CCVH
   -Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide.
   -Goal off 2-3 L with CVVH.
   - Trend creatinine, UOP, monitor vitals.
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Given
   improvement with HD, CVVH, no thoracentesis at this time.
   - Continue CVVH.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM at 26.9
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -On tube feeds, holding for high residuals. Had been hypoglycemic in
   setting tube feeds held. Resumed currently.
   -Continue feeds, continue lactulose. No BM since admission to ICU.
   Continue ISS for glycemic control if hyperglycemic, GFS q4.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia post liver transplant complicated by recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis and subsequently transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and required intubation.

The patient's current conditions include:
1) Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient has a baseline low PaO2 likely due to impaired ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by known stable right pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites. He also has hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient's parenchymal opacities on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia versus pulmonary edema. These findings have improved and stabilized with CVVH and decreased central venous pressure (CVP). The patient's ABG on FiO2 of 40% is stable but academic. It is recommended to continue attempting weaning FiO2 to protect oxygen radical damage, with a goal PaO2 of 60-80. Antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/cipro) should be continued until cultures return. Renal dosing should be checked. Bladder pressure should be checked to rule out contribution to increased abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch. There is a low suspicion for pulmonary embolism ("

   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities c/w PNA vs. Pulmonary edema on CXR
   improved/stable with CVP down after HD/CCVH. Stable but academic ABG on
   FiO2 of 40%.
   *
   -Continue attempt wean FI02 to protect 02 radical damage.  Goal Pa02
   60-80
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro until cultures return. Check renal
   dosing.
   - Check bladder pressure to rule out contribution to increased
   abdominal pressure with subsequent atelectasis/VQ mismatch.
   - f/[**Location 134**] read LENIs, low suspicion currently for PE, particularly
   in face of improvement radiographically, just with HD/CVVH.
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Meld score today 30. -Was on cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis, now dosed for VAP.
   - No BM since admission. Continue lactulose.
   - Continue to check LFTS/ calc meld score for transplant.
   - Continue prograf. Check prograf level tomorrow.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Continue CCVH,  HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine,
   octreotide.
   -Goal off 2-3 L with CVVH.
    Trend creatinine, UOP, monitor vitals.
   5) PLEURAL EFFUSION: hepatohydrothorax given transudate on most recent
   thoracentesis +/- volume load in setting in renal failure. Given
   improvement with HD, CVVH, no thoracentesis at this time.
   - Continue CVVH.
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM at 26.9
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q12H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: made NPO given respiratory distress. Nutrition consulted.
   -On tube feeds, holding for high residuals. Had been hypoglycemic in
   setting tube feeds held. Resumed currently.
   -Continue feeds, continue lactulose. No BM since admission to ICU.
   Continue ISS for glycemic control if hyperglycemic, GFS q4.

","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30-year-old male with a complex medical history including biliary atresia, liver transplant (25 years ago), recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis after an exploratory laparotomy and is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient has a baseline low PaO2 due to impaired ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by a stable right pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites. Additionally, there is a known shunt from hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient's oxygen saturation has improved with conservative measures, but ongoing FiO2 weaning is necessary to avoid oxygen radical damage. Further assessment is needed to rule out any contribution of increased abdominal pressure to atelectasis/VQ mismatch.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of chronic rejection post-liver transplant and is currently on the transplant list with a MELD score of 30. Prophylactic antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) have been changed to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) coverage. Lactulose should be continued for hep"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure and liver failure. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate between 67-112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99-155/78-96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal ventilation.

The patient is receiving several medications, including midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions, as well as other ICU medications. The patient has allergies to ibuprofen and an unknown allergy.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,868 mL and output of 3,879 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 1,011 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), and blood products.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of liver transplant failure due to rejection.
- The patient is currently experiencing acute renal failure and respiratory failure.
- The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation and dialysis, and fluid management is a concern with a desire for a net negative fluid balance towards dry weight.
- The patient has liver failure and is listed for a liver transplant. Prophylactic measures are in place to prevent complications such as hepatic encephalopathy.
- The patient has anemia, which is attributed to renal failure and possible medication contribution.
- Nutritional support has been initiated, with efforts to improve bowel movements and promote glycemic control.
- Various lines and catheters have been placed for medical management, including a PICC line, dialysis catheter, arterial line, and prophylactic measures against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints mentioned are respiratory failure and liver failure. 

The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including CVVH clotting off, intubation, mechanical ventilation, administration of various medications, and dialysis. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate between 69-112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/78 to 155/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,868 mL and total output of 3,879 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,011 mL. 

Laboratory results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, TCO2, glucose, liver function tests, electrolyte levels, and other markers. 

The assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pain control, liver function abnormalities, and ICU care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include worsening respiratory failure leading to further hypoxemia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require ongoing dialysis support. Liver function abnormalities may indicate potential hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy. Additionally,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of liver transplant failure due to rejection. He is currently experiencing acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension.

The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a need for ongoing dialysis to achieve net diuresis. Mechanical ventilation will be continued, and the patient's ABG, SaO2 levels will be monitored, aiming to maintain SaO2 above 90%. The possibility of pressure support ventilation (PSV) will be considered once more negative.

Pulmonary infiltrates may be due to pulmonary edema (cardiogenic vs. non-cardiogenic), but pneumonia should also be considered. Empirical antimicrobials will be administered, and follow-up BAL results will be awaited.

The patient's liver function is impaired, and he is listed for another liver transplant. Lactulose and ciprofloxacin will be given for prophylaxis. Prograf needs to be converted to intravenous administration as it was not being received/absorbed due to high residuals.

Anemia is attributed to renal failure and possible medication contributions. Nutritional support will be initiated through total parenteral nutrition (TF) initially with high residuals. Bowel regimen will be increased"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities c/w PNA vs. pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. Stable but acidemic ABG on
   FiO2 of 40%. Able to get -3L off yesterday.
   *Metabolic acidosis with appropriate  respiratory compensation
   * Bladder pressure 14, relatively low and unlikely to make much of a
   difference in atelectasis/VQ mismatch
   * Day 3 of vanc/cefepime/cipro. BAL negative, sputum negative.
   - D/C abx today due to negative cultures, follow clinical status
   - Continue dialysis with net goal of 2L off - follow up renal recs
   - Cont AC for now while getting volume off
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals. BM last
   night after increase in lactulose regimen. KUB no evidence of
   obstruction, large amount of stool in colon.
   - Titrate lactulose to [**12-28**] BM per day
   - Reglan PRN for nausea
   - Restart tube feeds - check residuals
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Liver following.
   - Restart cipro
   - TacroFK today, once level back Liver will decide dose of tacrolimus
   to give
   - Continue lactulose
   - Trend LFTs
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Renal recs - CVVH vs HD, goal of -2L
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide
   - Trend chem-7
   5) Coagulopathy: Elevated PTT, off heparin currently
   - Recheck PTT off line without heparin
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM at 26.9
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q24H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: currently NPO
   - TF, check residuals

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia post liver transplant, complicated by recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted for peritonitis and underwent an exploratory laparotomy before being transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and requiring intubation.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1) Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient has a baseline low PaO2 likely due to impaired V/Q mismatch from a stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is also shunting from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
2) GI dysmotility: The patient has abdominal distention, TF residuals, and had a bowel movement last night after an increase in lactulose regimen. KUB shows no evidence of obstruction, with a large amount of stool in the colon.
3) Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of biliary atresia post liver transplant (at age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. He is currently on the transplant list, and his liver function will be closely monitored.

   cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   24 Hour Events:
   -CVVH goal -2L per day - total net negative 3L
   -Changed to SL tacrolimus due to low levels and impaired PO intake due
   to low GI motility. Talked to liver, D/C tacrolimus, follow AM tacroFK
   levels, Liver will consult on dose to give. Pt needs eval for liver and
   kidney transplant. Follow liver and renal recs.
   -Bladder pressure measured = 14, no para at this time

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress
   and requiring intubation last night.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities c/w PNA vs. pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. Stable but acidemic ABG on
   FiO2 of 40%. Able to get -3L off yesterday.
   *Metabolic acidosis with appropriate  respiratory compensation
   * Bladder pressure 14, relatively low and unlikely to make much of a
   difference in atelectasis/VQ mismatch
   * Day 3 of vanc/cefepime/cipro. BAL negative, sputum negative.
   - D/C abx today due to negative cultures, follow clinical status
   - Continue dialysis with net goal of 2L off - follow up renal recs
   - Cont AC for now while getting volume off
 consider PS in PM
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
 restraints as needed
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals. BM last
   night after increase in lactulose regimen. KUB no evidence of
   obstruction, large amount of stool in colon.
   - Titrate lactulose to [**12-28**] BM per day
   - Reglan PRN for nausea
   - Restart tube feeds - check residuals
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Liver following.
   - Restart cipro prophylaxis
   - TacroFK today, once level back Liver will decide dose of tacrolimus
   to give
   - Continue lactulose
   - Trend LFTs
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH last night but stopped due to filter clot, so HD will start this
   AM.
   - Renal recs - CVVH vs HD, goal of -2L
   - Continue HRS therapy with albumin 1g/kg, midodrine, octreotide
 f/u
   liver recs
   - Trend chem-7 [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN for CRT labs
   5) Coagulopathy: Elevated PTT, off heparin currently
   - Recheck PTT off line without heparin
   6) ANEMIA: Patient with intermitent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable this AM at 26.9
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend hct Q24H, transfuse hct<21.
   7) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.
   8) FEN: currently NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant (25 years ago), recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma.
- The patient was admitted with peritonitis after an exploratory laparotomy and is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and requiring intubation.
- The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hypoxic respiratory distress, GI dysmotility, cirrhosis, renal failure, coagulopathy, anemia, anisocoria, and access issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's low PaO2 levels indicate impaired oxygenation. Factors contributing to worsening hypoxia include a stable large pleural effusion, atelectasis from ascites, and shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome. Bladder pressure is relatively low, making a significant difference in atelectasis/VQ mismatch unlikely. Day 3 of vanc/cefepime/cipro. BAL negative, sputum negative. Antibiotics will be discontinued today due to negative cultures, and follow-up renal recommendations will be implemented. Continue dialysis with a net goal of 2L off. Consider PS in PM.
2. GI dysmotility: The patient has abdominal distention, TF residuals, and a monstrous"

   30 yo m, s/p liver transplant (failed due to rejection) now with acute
   renal failure and respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including acute volume overload
   in setting of acute on chronic renal failure, on background of
   pulmonary HTN, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt),
   and atelectasis due to abd distension.  .   Plan continue dialysis for
   net diuresis.  Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2,
   maintain SaO2 >90%.
   Hope for PSV perhaps this afternoon
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- may be due to pulmonary edema (cardiogenic vs.
   non-cardiogenic), but consider pneumonia.  .  Empirical antimicrobials.
   Follow up BAL results were negative
 d/c ABX
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- ATN versus HRS type1.  Rx Midodrine and
   Octreotide, Albumin challenge as per Liver and Renal.  Continue CVVH
   but may be able to switch to HD
   LIVER FAILURE -- currently listed for liver transplant.  Lactulose and
   Cipro for prophylaxis. Prograf
 need to convert to IV as was not
   receiving/absorbing due to high residuals
   PTT- repeat- may have been off hep line
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiated TF
 initially high residuals.  Bowels

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 30-year-old male who underwent a liver transplant but experienced rejection.
- He is currently in the ICU with acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure.
- The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and pulmonary hypertension.
- He also has a possible heptaopulmonary shunt and abdominal distension.
- The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (or heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension.
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/83 mmHg to 157/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with fair air movement in the chest, 3+ edema, and a distended abdomen.
- Laboratory results indicate liver function abnormalities, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, slightly decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and low potassium levels.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.40"

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/83 to 157/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is also sedated and has a temperature of 35.9°C.

The patient has a history of allergies to ibuprofen, unknown cause. They have been receiving multiple antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on several infusions such as fentanyl for pain management, calcium gluconate and potassium chloride during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and midazolam for sedation.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance with a total input of 3,276 mL and total output of 6,359 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -3,083 mL. The patient's urine output is 199 mL, NG output is 120 mL, and stool output is 850 mL. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg, bladder pressure is 14 mmHg, and the respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with assisted mode ventilation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and volume overload. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient also has liver function abnormalities, pain control issues, and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's acute respiratory failure, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or worsening hypoxemia.

2. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure increases the risk of worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and potential development of renal replacement therapy needs.

3. Liver Complications: The liver function abnormalities may indicate potential hepatic dysfunction or injury, which can lead to further complications like coagulopathy or hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Infection Risk: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), urinary tract infections (UTIs), or surgical site infections (SSIs).

5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's vital signs indicate elevated blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP), which may suggest potential cardiovascular instability or heart failure.

6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other gastrointestinal complications due to the critical illness and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who has had a liver transplant in the past but experienced rejection. Currently, the patient is facing acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possibly heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation to support his breathing. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is being prophylaxed with a high head of bed (HOB) and chlorhexidine.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed. This can lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic toxins.

3. Liver failure: The patient is listed for another liver transplant due to the previous transplant rejection. Liver failure can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.

4. Infections: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his immunocompromised state from the liver transplant and ongoing treatment. Infections can be bacterial, viral, or fungal and can affect different organs, including the lungs, liver, and bloodstream"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**], a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma, was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and increased work of breathing. The patient has multiple complications including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, renal failure, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, anemia, anisocoria, and GI dysmotility. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxia and increased work of breathing, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of parenchymal opacities on chest X-ray indicates a possible infection, which may worsen if not appropriately treated.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The findings of increased pulmonary venous congestion and perihilar haziness suggest worsening pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed effectively.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of post-strep glomerulonephritis and is currently experiencing acute-on-subacute renal failure. This condition may progress to end-stage renal disease if not treated promptly.
5. Coagulopathy: The elevated PTT indicates a bleeding tendency,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia who underwent a liver transplant 25 years ago. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and increased work of breathing, requiring intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis (GN), nephrotic syndrome, and asthma.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure due to impaired ventilation-perfusion matching caused by pleural effusion and atelectasis, as well as shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome. There are parenchymal opacities consistent with pneumonia or pulmonary edema. The patient is already on antibiotics, and BAL and sputum cultures are pending.

The patient also has gastrointestinal dysmotility with abdominal distention and tube feeding residuals. His kidney function is impaired, and he has acute on chronic renal failure. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated.

Additionally, the patient has coagulopathy with elevated PTT (partial thromboplastin time) and thrombocytopenia. He has anemia requiring intermittent transfusions and anisocoria (unequal pupil size), which may be due to drug effects.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, liver failure, and renal failure. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and receiving multiple medications through various IV lines. The patient has a history of pain control, nutrition alteration, and liver function abnormalities. They have been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. This is a common complication in ICU patients, especially those who are intubated for an extended period.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI): The patient has multiple IV lines, including a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line. These lines increase the risk of developing CRBSI, a serious infection that can lead to sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. The patient is receiving prophylactic DVT medication to reduce this risk.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis due to the increased risk of developing stress ulcers in the ICU setting.
5. Delirium: Critically ill patients, especially those with multi-organ failure, are at risk of developing delirium. This can be a challenging complication to manage in"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, liver failure, and renal failure. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with fair air movement and no wheeze in the chest. There is also 3+ edema in the extremities. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/73 to 160/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and platelet count. The creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. Liver function tests show abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Electrolyte levels are also imbalanced, with high potassium and low sodium levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, and progression of liver dysfunction. Additionally, the patient is at risk for infections due to the invasive lines and catheters in place.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, and liver function. Appropriate interventions should be implemented to address any complications that may arise."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who underwent a liver transplant but experienced rejection. He now has acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complex, involving multiple organ systems. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma should be monitored for.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which could progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately. Complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances need to be closely monitored.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function abnormalities indicate ongoing liver dysfunction. Complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy should be monitored for.
4. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to immunosuppression from the liver transplant and prolonged ICU stay. Infections could include bacterial infections, fungal infections, or opportunistic infections.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.
6. Malnutrition: The patient may be at risk for malnutrition due to poor oral intake and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Nutritional support should be provided to maintain adequate nutritional status.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management"

 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
   30 yo m, s/p liver transplant (failed due to rejection) now with acute
   renal failure and respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including acute volume overload
   in setting of acute on chronic renal failure, on background of
   pulmonary HTN, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt),
   and atelectasis due to abd distension.    Plan continue dialysis for
   net diuresis.  Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2,
   maintain SaO2 >90%.
   Hope for PSV perhaps this afternoon
 he failed sbt this AM but erhaps
   with more volume off and adequate sedation he will do OK on PSV closer
   to 15-20/5. Also meanwhile we will drop rate on AC to 20 and see how he
   holds given alalemia
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES suspect mostly acute volume- BAL negative stop
   empiric ABX
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- ATN versus HRS type1.  Rx Midodrine and
   Octreotide, Albumin challenge as per Liver and Renal but did not
   improve
Hepatology wants to continue.  Continue CVVH but may be able
   to switch to HD in next 24-48 hours.
   LIVER FAILURE -- currently listed for liver transplant.  Lactulose and
   Cipro for prophylaxis. Prograf
 level low yesterday speak with
   pharmacy about adjusting.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiated TF
 initially high residuals improved
   but now worse again. Check KUB serial abd exams may need post pyloric

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who has experienced multiple organ failures including respiratory failure, liver failure, and renal failure. He has a history of liver transplant failure due to rejection. The patient's current condition is described as follows:

- Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension.

- Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may be due to either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Midodrine and octreotide have been administered for hepatorenal syndrome, but there was no improvement. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being continued, and a switch to hemodialysis (HD) may be possible in the next 24-48 hours.

- Liver Failure: The patient has severe liver failure and is currently listed for a liver transplant. Lactulose and ciprofloxacin are being used for prophylaxis against hepatic encephalopathy and infections, respectively. Prograf levels are low, and the pharmacy is being consulted about adjusting the dosage.

- Nutritional Support: The patient is receiving total parental"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and increased work of breathing requiring intubation
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY Failue: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities c/w PNA vs. pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. Stable but acidemic ABG on
   FiO2 of 40%. 3L off yesterday. High PaO2 in last ABG, so decrease FiO2
   and plan another attempt at PSV.
   *Resolution of alkalosis.
   * Day 3 of vanc/cefepime/cipro. BAL negative, sputum negative.
   - follow up renal recs, CVVH today with ?HD in future, continue net
   negative
   - PS later today, depending on how pt responds will alter extubation
   plans
   - Wean sedation as tolerated, restraints as needed for now
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals. KUB no
   evidence of obstruction, large amount of stool in colon.
   - Tube feeds restarted, hold for residuals over 150
   - Make NG post-pyloric
   - PRN Reglan
   - Titrate lactulose to [**12-28**] BM per day
   - KUB today
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Liver following.
   - Cont cipro prophylaxis
   - TacroFK level daily with 0.5 mg daily.
   - Cont lactulose
   - Trend LFTs
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH for now.
   - Renal recommended intermittent HD in 24-48Hr, liver advocates for
   continued CVVH. If filter clots may go to HD. Goal net negative.
   - HRS therapy - liver recs
   - Trend chem-7 [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN for CRT labs
   5) Coagulopathy: Elevated PTT, off heparin currently. Down from 150
   yesterday.
   - Cont to trend PTT
   6) Thrombocytopenia: slowly trending down over past week, generally
   stable. Off heparin except for flushes. Not quick decline like would
   expect with HIT. On CVVH, uremia. Withhold HITT workup if remains
   stable.
   - Cont to trend plt
   7) ANEMIA: Patient with intermittent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable.
   - Trend hct Q24H, transfuse hct<21.
   8) ANISOCORIA: Non-contrast CTH without acute pathology and diminished
   asymmetry of pupils on exam this AM. Unclear etiology; likely drug
   effect given improvement this AM and no findings on CT.
   -Continue to follow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, post-liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis and now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing requiring intubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management. These include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has low PaO2 levels due to impaired ventilation-perfusion matching, pleural effusion, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and pneumonia. The goal is to improve oxygenation and wean off ventilatory support.
2. GI dysmotility: The patient has abdominal distention and TF residuals. There is no evidence of obstruction on KUB, but there is a large amount of stool in the colon. The plan is to restart tube feeds, make NG post-pyloric, and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has chronic rejection post liver transplant. He is on the transplant list, and liver function needs to be closely monitored.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis or hepatorenal syndrome type 1. CVVH is being used for now, with plans for"

   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and increased work of breathing requiring intubation
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY Failue: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities likely due to pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. 3L fluid off yesterday.
   Resolution of alkalosis. ABG stable/with high PaO2 on low AC settings,
   will attempt PSV this AM, with potential extubation this PM. In order
   to optimize his respiratory status, we will continue CVVH with -150
   cc/hr.
   - Wean vent to PSV this AM, with potential extubation this PM
   - Continue CVVH today with ?HD in future, continue net negative. Follow
   up renal recs.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated, restraints as needed for now.
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals. KUB no
   evidence of obstruction, large amount of stool in colon, but large BM
   this AM.
   - Tube feeds restarted. Advance toward goal of 50 cc/hr as tolerated.
   Hold for residuals over 150
   - PRN Reglan
   - Titrate lactulose to [**12-28**] BM per day
   - KUB today
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Liver following. [**Month (only) 8**] need PCP prophylaxis given
   patient with PCP on floor and his immunocompromised state on tacro.
   - Cont cipro prophylaxis.
   -Start clotrimazole per transplant.
   - Ask liver about PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**].
   - TacroFK level daily, with 0.5 mg daily for now. Coordinate
   administration/level check timing with pharmacy.
   - Cont lactulose, as per above.
   - Trend LFTs.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH for now to optimize respiratory status in peri-extubation setting.
   Once fluid status is optimized, can likely go forward with intermittent
   HD.
   - Continue CVVH, with goal of  -150 cc/hr.
   - Continue Octreotide and Midodrine for HRS.
   - Trend chem-7 [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN for CRT labs
   5) Thrombocytopenia: slowly trending down over past week, generally
   stable in past few days. Not likely due to HIT since he has been on
   heparin for >2 weeks (HIT is usually within 2-14 days) and he has
   remained stable despite being continued on heparin. Withhold HITT
   workup if remains stable.
   - Cont to trend plt
   6) Coagulopathy: Elevated PTT, stable now. No active signs of bleeding
   or thrombosis.
   - Cont to trend PTT
   7) ANEMIA: Patient with intermittent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable.
   - Trend hct Q24H, transfuse hct<21.
   9) FEN: hold TF for residuals > 150cc. TF restarted following BM.
   Advance as tolerated, as per above. ISS for glycemic control.

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] has chronic hypoxia with an arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 70s, likely due to impaired ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch caused by stable right pleural effusion, atelectasis from ascites, and hepatopulmonary syndrome. He also has parenchymal opacities likely due to pulmonary edema, with an improved/stable chest X-ray (CXR) and negative cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and increased work of breathing requiring intubation
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY Failue: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities likely due to pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. 3L fluid off yesterday.
   Resolution of alkalosis. ABG stable/with high PaO2 on low AC settings,
   will attempt PSV this AM, with potential extubation this PM. In order
   to optimize his respiratory status, we will continue CVVH with -150
   cc/hr.
   - Wean vent to PSV this AM, with potential extubation this PM
   - Continue CVVH today with ?HD in future, continue net negative. Follow
   up renal recs.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated, restraints as needed for now.
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals. KUB no
   evidence of obstruction, large amount of stool in colon, but large BM
   this AM.
   - Tube feeds restarted. Advance toward goal of 50 cc/hr as tolerated.
   Hold for residuals over 150
   - PRN Reglan
   - Titrate lactulose to [**12-28**] BM per day
   - KUB today
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Liver following. [**Month (only) 8**] need PCP prophylaxis given
   patient with PCP on floor and his immunocompromised state on tacro.
   - Cont cipro prophylaxis.
   -Start clotrimazole per transplant.
   - Ask liver about PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**].
   - TacroFK level daily, with 0.5 mg daily for now. Coordinate
   administration/level check timing with pharmacy.
   - Cont lactulose, as per above.
   - Trend LFTs.
   4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH started [**2135-7-15**]. Continue CVVH for now to optimize respiratory
   status in peri-extubation setting. Once fluid status is optimized, can
   likely go forward with intermittent HD.
   - Continue CVVH, with goal of  -150 cc/hr.
   - Continue Octreotide and Midodrine for HRS.
   - Trend chem-7 [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN for CRT labs
   5) Thrombocytopenia: slowly trending down over past week, generally
   stable in past few days. Not likely due to HIT since he has been on
   heparin for >2 weeks (HIT is usually within 2-14 days) and he has
   remained stable despite being continued on heparin. Withhold HITT
   workup if remains stable.
   - Cont to trend plt
   6) Coagulopathy: Elevated PTT, stable now. No active signs of bleeding
   or thrombosis.
   - Cont to trend PTT
   7) ANEMIA: Patient with intermittent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable.
   - Trend hct Q24H, transfuse hct<21.

","Summary:
- Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30-year-old man with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He is admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing, requiring intubation.
- The patient has multiple complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and potential GI dysmotility.
- The respiratory failure is due to a combination of factors, including impaired ventilation-perfusion matching, pulmonary edema, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and atelectasis.
- Acute renal failure may be secondary to acute tubular necrosis or hepatorenal syndrome type 1.
- CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated to optimize respiratory status and fluid status.
- There are concerns about potential infections, including PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia) prophylaxis, given the patient's immunocompromised state.
- The patient also has thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, anemia, and requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low PaO2 and increased work of breathing indicate significant hypoxia. The underlying causes include impaired VQ"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who has experienced multiple organ failures including respiratory, renal, and liver failure. The patient underwent a liver transplant due to rejection, but unfortunately, developed acute renal and respiratory failures.

The respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving acute volume overload in the setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possibly heptaopulmonary) shunt, and atelectasis caused by abdominal distension. The patient has been aggressively diuresed and switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 60-70. The plan is to attempt extubation this afternoon if the patient's condition improves.

The acute renal failure is likely either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS). Midodrine and octreotide have been administered, along with an albumin challenge as per liver and renal guidelines. However, there was no improvement, and the patient will continue with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), possibly switching to hemodialysis (HD) in the next 24-48 hours.

The liver failure has resulted in the patient being listed for a liver transplant. Prophylactic lactulose and ciprofloxacin have been administered, and the Prograf level was found to be low yesterday. The pharmacy will assist in adjusting"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who underwent a liver transplant due to rejection. He now presents with acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension. The patient continues to require dialysis for net diuresis and mechanical ventilation, with ABG monitoring and maintaining SaO2 >90%. 

The patient also has liver failure and is listed for another liver transplant. Prophylactic lactulose and ciprofloxacin are being administered, along with adjusting Prograf levels. 

The patient's nutritional support involves initiating tube feeding (TF) initially at a high rate but now experiencing worsening residuals. Serial abdominal exams may be necessary, and a post-pyloric dophoff may be required. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to various factors, including acute volume overload, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis. Monitoring ABG and maintaining SaO2 >90% is crucial. If the patient does not respond well to pressure support ventilation (PSV), alternative options such as adjusting the rate on assisted control (AC) should be considered.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could be due to either acute"

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of liver transplant failure due to rejection. He is currently experiencing acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute volume overload in the setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary (possible heptaopulmonary with shunt), and atelectasis due to abdominal distension. The patient has been aggressively diuresed and switched to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 60-70. The plan is to wean drips and attempt extubation this afternoon.

The patient also has acute renal failure, which could be either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS). Midodrine and octreotide have been given, and an albumin challenge was attempted but did not improve the condition. CVVH has been continued, and it may be possible to switch to hemodialysis (HD) in the next 24-48 hours.

The patient's liver function is abnormal, as he is listed for a liver transplant. Prophylactic lactulose and ciprofloxacin have been administered. His Prograf level was low yesterday, and coordination is needed to adjust the medication and draw levels.

The patient's nutritional support has been resumed with tube feeds using NovaSource Renal (Full) at a rate of 10 mL"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and increased work of breathing requiring intubation, now with improved
   respiratory status and post extubation yesterday.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY Failue: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing in setting of chronic hypoxia with AA
   gradient.
    *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities likely due to pulmonary edema, with CXR
   improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. 3L fluid off yesterday.
   Resolution of alkalosis. ABG stable/with high PaO2 on low AC settings,
   will attempt PSV this AM, with potential extubation this PM. In order
   to optimize his respiratory status, we will continue CVVH with -150
   cc/hr.
   - Wean vent to PSV this AM, with potential extubation this PM
   - Continue CVVH today with ?HD in future, continue net negative. Follow
   up renal recs.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated, restraints as needed for now.
    2) GI DYSMOTILITY, with abdominal distention, TF residuals. KUB no
   evidence of obstruction, large amount of stool in colon, but large BM
   this AM.
   - Tube feeds restarted. Advance toward goal of 50 cc/hr as tolerated.
   Hold for residuals over 150
   - PRN Reglan
   - Titrate lactulose to [**12-28**] BM per day
   - KUB today
   3) CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (age 4) complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on
   transplant list. Liver following. [**Month (only) 8**] need PCP prophylaxis given
   patient with PCP on floor and his immunocompromised state on tacro. No
   PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**] per ID.
    - Cont cipro prophylaxis and clotimazole troche.
   - TacroFK level daily, with 0.5 mg daily for now. Coordinate
   administration/level check timing with pharmacy.
   - Cont lactulose, as per above.
   - Trend LFTs.
    4) RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH started [**2135-7-15**]. Continue CVVH for now to optimize respiratory
   status in peri-extubation setting. Once fluid status is optimized, can
   likely go forward with intermittent HD. D/C'd HRS regimen.
   - Continue CVVH, with goal of  -150 cc/hr.
   - Trend chem-7 [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN for CRT labs
   5) Thrombocytopenia: slowly trending down over past week, generally
   stable in past few days. Not likely due to HIT since he has been on
   heparin for >2 weeks (HIT is usually within 2-14 days) and he has
   remained stable despite being continued on heparin. Withhold HITT
   workup if remains stable.
   - Cont to trend plts
    6) Coagulopathy: Elevated PTT, stable now. No active signs of bleeding
   or thrombosis.
    - Cont to trend PTT
   7) ANEMIA: Patient with intermittent transfusion requirement, with last
   transfusion requirement on [**7-14**] (1 unit PRBC).  Likely has chronic
   anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct stable.
   - Trend hct Q24H, transfuse hct<21.
    9) FEN: Restart PO as tolerated. ISS for glycemic control.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant (25 years ago), recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis after an exploratory laparotomy and transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing, requiring intubation. He has since improved and was extubated yesterday.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] has multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia and increased work of breathing, including impaired V/Q mismatch due to a stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites, shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome, and pulmonary edema. His respiratory status has improved, and he is being weaned off the ventilator.

2. GI Dysmotility: The patient exhibits abdominal distention, TF residuals, and large bowel movements. There is no evidence of obstruction, but there is a significant amount of stool in the colon. Tube feeds have been restarted, and the goal is to advance toward 50 cc/hr as tolerated. Lactulose will be titrated to 12-28 bowel movements per day.

3. Cirrhosis: Mr."

","The patient is a 30-year-old man with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis following an exploratory laparotomy and is now in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing requiring intubation. The patient has improved respiratory status and was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient has multiple potential medical complications, including:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline low PaO2 is likely due to impaired ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by known stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites. Additionally, shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome contributes to worsening hypoxia.
2. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a new low-grade fever and leukocytosis, which could indicate new pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), or other infection, possibly related to a central venous catheter (CVC).
3. GI dysmotility: The patient has mild-to-moderate abdominal distention post-ex-lap, now with frequent loose stools. This could be due to aggressive bowel regimen or Clostridium difficile infection.

   and increased work of breathing requiring intubation, now with improved
   respiratory status and post extubation yesterday but with low grade
   fever and inc WBC today.
   # HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing at admission, in setting of chronic
   hypoxia with AA gradient.
    *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities on past imaging likely due to pulmonary edema,
   with CXR improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. -150 cc/hr off
   yesterday. Successful extubation with stable SpO2 yesterday.
   *New low grade fever and leukocytosis yesterday. Ddx includes new
   pneumonia vs. SBP vs. other infection (?line). Will panculture, CXR,
   and IR paracentesis today.
   *We continued CVVH yesterday in order to optimize his respiratory
   status, but now that he appears to have had resolution of much of his
   peripheral edema, we can likely D/C CVVH today and transition to
   intermittent HD.

   # GI DYSMOTILITY: With baseline mild-mod abdominal distention s/p
   ex-lap, now with frequency loose stool. Will check C diff, as per
   above, in setting of fever, though loose stool is likely due to
   aggressive bowel regimen.  Currently NPO after removal of NGT with

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis and required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He has since been extubated and is currently in the MICU for continued monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. Although he has been successfully extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying chronic hypoxia, L pleural effusion, atelectasis, and hepatopulmonary syndrome.
2. Infection: The patient has developed a low-grade fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate a new infection such as pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), or other infections related to indwelling lines. Diagnostic tests including panculture, chest X-ray, and an invasive radiology paracentesis have been planned to identify the cause.
3. GI dysmotility: Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] has mild to moderate abdominal distention and frequency loose stools. This could be due"

","The patient is a 30-year-old male who underwent a liver transplant but experienced rejection and now presents with acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, with acute volume overload being the predominant factor in the setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient also has pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary/hepatopulmonary shunt, and atelectasis due to abdominal distension. The patient was aggressively diuresed and successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient's renal failure could be either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS). He did well with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) but should now be able to switch to hemodialysis (HD) since he is extubated.

There are concerns about potential infections such as low-grade temperatures on CVVH and rising white blood cell count. The patient's lines have been cultured, and an arterial line and central line have been pulled. A chest X-ray is needed to check for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a stool test is required for Clostridium difficile. Diagnostic paracentesis is also needed.

The patient's liver failure has led to him being listed for another liver transplant. Prophylactic lactulose and ciprofloxacin have been started, and the goal Prograf level is set at 2-28.

Nutritional support should involve restarting the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who underwent a liver transplant but experienced rejection. He now presents with acute renal failure and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, with the predominant factor being acute volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Other contributing factors include pulmonary hypertension, portopulmonary/hepatopulmonary shunt, and atelectasis due to abdominal distension.

The patient was aggressively diuresed and successfully extubated yesterday. He will continue to be closely monitored. The patient also has acute renal failure, which could be due to either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) was performed, but now that the patient is extubated, he should be able to switch to hemodialysis (HD).

The patient has low-grade temperatures on CVVH and a rising white blood cell count. Therefore, blood cultures from all lines, removal of the arterial line, chest X-ray for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stool for Clostridium difficile are pending. Empiric antibiotics are being held for now while the workup is ongoing.

The patient is currently listed for liver transplant and is receiving lactulose and ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis. Prograf levels are pending, with the goal of maintaining a level of 2-28.

The patient's remaining issues include restarting the oral diet, glycemic control, line placements, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and communication with the father.

Overall, the patient's main concerns are respiratory failure, acute renal failure, liver failure, and nutritional support. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, infections (such as VAP or Clostridium difficile), and complications related to the upcoming liver transplant."

 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and increased work of breathing requiring intubation, now with improved
   respiratory status and post extubation yesterday but with low grade
   fever and inc WBC today.
   # HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing at admission, in setting of chronic
   hypoxia with AA gradient.
    *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Parenchymal opacities on past imaging likely due to pulmonary edema,
   with CXR improved/stable and prelim neg cx from BAL. -150 cc/hr off
   yesterday. Successful extubation with stable SpO2 yesterday.
   *New low grade fever and leukocytosis yesterday. Ddx includes new
   pneumonia vs. SBP vs. other infection (?line). Will panculture, CXR,
   and IR paracentesis today.
   *We continued CVVH yesterday in order to optimize his respiratory
   status, but now that he appears to have had resolution of much of his
   peripheral edema, we can likely D/C CVVH today and transition to
   intermittent HD.

   -As per above, panculture, CXR, and IR paracentesis today.
   # GI DYSMOTILITY: With baseline mild-mod abdominal distention s/p
   ex-lap, now with frequency loose stool. Will check C diff, as per
   above, in setting of fever, though loose stool is likely due to
   aggressive bowel regimen.  Currently NPO after removal of NGT with

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted for peritonitis following an exploratory laparotomy and was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing requiring intubation. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he was extubated two days ago but now presents with a low-grade fever and increased white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline low PaO2 is likely due to impaired ventilation-perfusion matching caused by a known stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites. Additionally, shunting from known hepatopulmonary syndrome may contribute to worsening hypoxia.

2. Infection: The patient's new low-grade fever and leukocytosis could be indicative of a new infection, such as pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), or other infections related to indwelling lines. Further diagnostic tests, including panculture, chest X-ray, and interventional radiology (IR) paracentesis, are planned to identify the source of infection.

3. Gastrointestinal dysmotility: The patient has mild-moderate abdominal distention following exploratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis following an exploratory laparotomy and transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing requiring intubation. His respiratory status has improved post-extubation, but he is now experiencing a low-grade fever and increased white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a baseline low PaO2 due to impaired ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis. Additionally, hepatopulmonary syndrome contributes to shunting of blood. New parenchymal opacities on imaging suggest pulmonary edema, which is now mild. The patient successfully underwent extubation with stable oxygen saturation yesterday. The differential diagnosis includes new pneumonia versus spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) versus other infections (possibly line-related). Further investigations include panculture, chest X-ray (CXR), and interventional radiology (IR) paracentesis.

2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's low-grade fever and increased white blood cell count may indicate a new infection. The differential diagnosis includes new pneumonia, SB"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant (25 years ago), recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis after an exploratory laparotomy and was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing, requiring intubation. His respiratory status has improved since extubation, but he still has a low-grade fever and increased white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] experienced hypoxic respiratory failure due to multiple factors, including impaired ventilation-perfusion matching caused by stable left pleural effusion and atelectasis from ascites, as well as shunting from known hepatopulmonary syndrome. Although his respiratory status has improved post-extubation, careful monitoring is required.
2. Leukocytosis/Fever: Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] continues to have a low-grade fever and leukocytosis. Empiric coverage with vancomycin and Zosyn is being given, and blood cultures are pending. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause of these findings.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant at age 4, chronic rejection, cirrhosis, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted with peritonitis after undergoing exploratory laparotomy. The patient subsequently developed respiratory distress and fluid overload in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). He was intubated, dialyzed, and now has been extubated. The patient is febrile and receiving empirical antibiotics.

24-hour events include blood cultures being taken from the central lines, arterial line removal, urine culture, stool culture, and paracentesis performed under ultrasound guidance. The patient has allergies to ibuprofen and an unknown allergy. He received antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin) last night.

Medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged except where noted above and below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.8 to 99.3 Celsius, heart rate between 82 and 106 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102 to 156/71 to 102 mmHg, respiratory rate between 26 and 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's weight is currently 70 kg, down from 77.5 kg upon admission.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,750 mL and total output of 5,733 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,983 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals poor dentition, endotracheal tube in place, crackles bibasilar on chest auscultation, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli. Other lab results are provided.

Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, pain control (acute and chronic), liver function abnormalities, and potential complications such as infection, bleeding, and organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state from chronic rejection and cirrhosis. He has already developed fever and is receiving empirical antibiotics. Blood cultures have been obtained from central lines, urine culture, stool culture, and paracentesis has been performed. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary will be important.

2. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PT/INR indicates a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of any bleeding tendencies or abnormal bruising will be necessary. Prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor should be continued.

3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, and ongoing monitoring of renal function is essential. Dialysis may be required to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances. The patient also has liver function abnormalities, and monitoring of liver enzymes and hepatic synthetic function is important. Pulmonary hypertension may contribute to respiratory distress, and close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.

4. Other Complications: Given the patient's complex medical history and current critical condition, other complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and complications related to mechanical ventilation should also be considered and monitored."

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant at age 4, chronic rejection, cirrhosis, and pulmonary hypertension. He was originally admitted with peritonitis after undergoing exploratory laparotomy. He was then transferred to the MICU due to respiratory distress and fluid overload in the setting of acute renal failure. The patient was intubated, dialyzed, and subsequently extubated. He is now experiencing fevers and is being treated empirically.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress indicates a potential complication of respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying lung disease or fluid overload.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has shown signs of acute renal failure, which can be caused by various factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.
3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's history of liver transplant, chronic rejection, and cirrhosis suggests ongoing liver function abnormalities. This may lead to complications like hepatic encephalopathy or portal hypertension.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension increases the risk of right heart strain and failure in the setting of respiratory distress.
5. Infection: The patient's current fevers indicate a possible infection. Empirical antibiotic therapy has been initiated, but further evaluation through cultures is necessary to identify the specific"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and increased work of breathing requiring intubation, now with improved
   respiratory status and post extubation yesterday but with low grade
   fever and inc WBC.
   .
   # HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing at admission, in setting of chronic
   hypoxia with AA gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Extubated, doing well without respiratory requirement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted with peritonitis and is currently in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing. The patient has been intubated but now has improved respiratory status and was extubated yesterday. He presents with a low-grade fever and increased white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be due to multiple factors such as impaired ventilation-perfusion matching, pleural effusion, and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of respiratory failure.
2. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's low-grade fevers and increased white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. This could lead to the development of sepsis or other complications if not appropriately managed.
3. GI dysmotility: The patient has chronic problems with poor oral intake. This can lead to malnutrition and further complications related to inadequate nutritional support.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's history of liver transplant and recurrent cirrhosis puts him at risk for complications associated with liver disease,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8404**] is a 30 year old gentleman with biliary atresia s/p liver
   transplant (25 years ago) complicated by recurrent cirrhosis,
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension,
   post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome and asthma admitted peritonitis
   s/p ex-lap now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and increased work of breathing requiring intubation, now with improved
   respiratory status and post extubation yesterday but with low grade
   fever and inc WBC.
   .
   # HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Multiple reasons for worsening hypoxia
   and increased work of breathing at admission, in setting of chronic
   hypoxia with AA gradient.
   *Baseline low PaO2 of 70s likely due to impaired VQ mm due to known
   stable L pleural effusion and from atelectasis from ascites.  Also
   shunt from known hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   *Extubated, doing well without respiratory requirement.
   - follow clinical status
   - intermittent HD
   .
   # Leukocytosis/Fever - low grade fevers, inadequate fluid for analysis
   on para, empiric treatment for SBP.
   - vanc, pip/tazo, vanc dosing with HD (day [**12-30**])
   - f/u cultures
   - tylenol under 2g for temp >101
   .
   # GI dysmotility: BM on lactulose, taking poor p.o per family chronic
   problem, requires encouragement to eat.
   - Cont lactulose - [**12-28**] BM per day, encourage PO
   .
   # Cirrhosis: history of biliary atresia s/p liver transplant (age 4)
   complicated by chronic rejection. Currently on transplant list. Liver
   following. Per ID, no need for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**].
   - pip/tazo (covers SBP), clotimazole troche.
   - TacroFK level daily, liver to give dosing recs, goal blood level [**2-28**].
   - Cont lactulose, as per above.
   - Trend LFTs.
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE: Patient with history of post-strep GN now with acute
   on sub-acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN versus HRS type 1.
   CVVH started [**2135-7-15**]. Fluid status is now optimized, so we can D/C CVVH
   and transition to intermittent HD. D/C'd HRS regimen.
   - Intermittent HD, renal following.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Slowly trending down over past week, now stable to
   improved. Not likely due to HIT since he has been on heparin for >2
   weeks (HIT is usually within 2-14 days) and plts have remained stable
   despite being continued on heparin. Remains stable.
   - Cont to trend plts
   .
   #  COAGULOPATHY: Elevated PTT in the setting of cirrhotic coagulopathy,
   stable now. No active signs of bleeding or thrombosis.
   - Cont to trend PTT
   .
   #  ANEMIA: Patient with intermittent transfusion requirement.  Likely
   has chronic anemia from liver and renal failure. Hct 23.8 from 25.6 .
   Per I.D 1 unit PRBC with HD.
   - Active Type and Cross

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia post liver transplant, complicated by recurrent cirrhosis, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, porto-pulmonary hypertension, post-infectious GN, nephrotic syndrome, and asthma. He was admitted for peritonitis following an exploratory laparotomy and later transferred to the MICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing, requiring intubation. His respiratory status has improved, and he was extubated yesterday but is experiencing low-grade fever and increased white blood cell count.

The patient's medical history includes chronic rejection of the liver transplant, for which he is currently on the transplant list. He also has a history of post-strep glomerulonephritis, acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome type 1. He underwent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) but has now optimized fluid status, so CVVH has been discontinued, and he is transitioning to intermittent hemodialysis (HD). His thrombocytopenia is slowly trending down but is stable and not likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
