 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress.  Patient likely has
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  Barriers to
   extubation are the increased intraabdominal pressure from the
   pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions.  Pt may require
   more PEEP given the increased intraabdominal pressure from edema
   - wean down PEEP as tolerated
   .
   * Pancreatitis
   Based on admission labs, had on presentation. No evidence of necrosis
   on OSH imaging. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge consider
   also hypertriglyceridemia. HCTZ can also be associated with
   pancreatitis
 though I think this is much less likely to be the
   explanation in his case.
   - baseline TG and lipase checked
   - Review CT abd from OSH with radiology, repeat here
   - Surgery recs appreciated
   .
   * Fever
   Could be due to pancreatitis alone, but need to consider other causes
   in this man with extended ICU admission - both noninfectious (eg
   acalculous cholecystitis, DVT, drug fever) and infectious (line
   infection, VAP, UTI etc). Exam not suggestive of clot.
   - As patient's WBC trended down with doripenem, would continue on
   meropenem and vancomycin here for now pending further workup, with plan
   to de-escalate if micro remains negative
   - CXR
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures. Check stool C diff if having diarrhea.
   - Followup remaining OSH micro
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances (eg hypernatremia). Head CT here
   negative.
   - Haldol prn, check QTC
   - Hold neurontin
   - optimize sedation
   .
   * Vent
   Currently on minimal supplemental O2. Difficulty in tolerated decreased
   PEEP at OSH may relate to abdominal inflammation/fluid.  CT here with
   significant consolidations at bases of uncertain cause.
   - Check ABG
   - Wean down PEEP as tolerated

   [**Name (NI) 156**] status: full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes and alcoholism. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and subsequently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and respiratory failure. Other conditions that may arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for various infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and bloodstream infection. This is indicated by his fever, elevated white blood cell count, and ongoing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Complications related to pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis could lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These complications may require surgical intervention.

3. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcoholism and current ICU stay, he is at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can present with symptoms like agitation, tremors, seizures, and hallucinations.

4. Delirium: Prolonged ICU stay, medications, electrolyte imbalances, and the underlying illness can contribute to delirium in this patient.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability associated with acute illness and pancreatitis increase the risk of developing DVT.

6. Nutritional deficiencies: Malnutrition can occur due to inadequate nutrition support during the ICU stay.

7. Glycemic control issues:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, who was admitted with acute pancreatitis. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, and there are concerns about potential complications such as infection (e.g., line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection) or non-infectious causes like acalculous cholecystitis or deep vein thrombosis. The patient's white blood cell count has been trending down with antibiotic treatment, indicating a possible response to the medication. However, cultures are still pending, and further workup is needed to determine the cause of the fever. The patient's agitation could be due to delirium tremens or other factors such as acute illness, medications, prolonged ICU stay, or electrolyte disturbances. Imaging studies have revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and right perihilar hazy opacities, likely atelectasis. The patient's blood glucose levels are being managed with an insulin drip. Other issues include anemia, hypertension, and alcohol and substance abuse, which require further evaluation and management."

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Pancreatitis
   Based on admission labs, had on presentation. No evidence of necrosis
   on OSH imaging. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge consider
   also hypertriglyceridemia. HCTZ can also be associated with
   pancreatitis
 though I think this is much less likely to be the
   explanation in his case.
   - Check TG here
   - Check baseline lipase here, but no role for trending lipase.
   - Review CT abd from OSH with radiology, repeat here
   - Surgery recs appreciated
   .
   * Fever
   Could be due to pancreatitis alone, but need to consider other causes
   in this man with extended ICU admission - both noninfectious (eg
   acalculous cholecystitis, DVT, drug fever) and infectious (line
   infection, VAP, UTI etc). Exam not suggestive of clot.
   - As patient's WBC trended down with doripenem, would continue on
   meropenem and vancomycin here for now pending further workup, with plan
   to de-escalate if micro remains negative
   - CXR
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures. Check stool C diff if having diarrhea.
   - Followup remaining OSH micro
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances (eg hypernatremia). Head CT here
   negative.
   - Haldol prn, check QTC
   - Hold neurontin
   .
   * Vent
   Currently on minimal supplemental O2. Difficulty in tolerated decreased
   PEEP at OSH may relate to abdominal inflammation/fluid.  CT here with
   significant consolidations at bases of uncertain cause.
   - Check ABG
   - Reattempt wean to PSV as tolerated in AM
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - IV thiamine, MVT, folate
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin drip
   .
   * HTN
   - DC clonidine patch, holding home antihypertensives for now
   .
   * Anemia
   Very concentrated at initial presentation likely [**2-12**] third spacing
   - Follow Hct daily, maintain active T+S
   - Guiac stools
   - Check haptoglobin, smear to r/o hemolysis
   - Can check basic b12/folate/iron

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholism who has been admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever, and alcohol abuse. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) due to the invasive procedures and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Pancreatitis-related complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to local and systemic complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, abscesses, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
3. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcoholism, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can present with symptoms like agitation, tremors, seizures, and delirium tremens.
4. Hypotension and organ dysfunction: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate potential hypotension, which may lead to organ dysfunction and inadequate perfusion.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus puts him at risk for hyperglycemia, especially with the use of insulin drips for glycemic control.

These are some of the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

   =============
   Respiratory status stable with adequate oxygenation although requiring
   moderate levels of PEEP. This may reflect increased pleural pressures
   secondary to increased abdominal pressure (respiratory system
   compliance approximately 25). If plateau pressures increase or he shows
   ongoing PEEP sensitivity, would place esophageal balloon to assess for
   restrictive chest wall physiology.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, and EtOH withdrawal. They are currently in the ICU and have been febrile, with a head CT showing no acute changes. An abdominal CT revealed fluid tracking to the pelvis but no major areas of necrosis. The patient is ventilated with AC and PEEP set at 10. They have been on invasive ventilation and multi-lumen support since August 23rd. Blood cultures were taken on August 23rd and 24th, along with a fever of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient is unable to provide their own history due to sedation and intubation. Allergies, medications, and infusions are documented. The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged except for specific noted updates. Review of systems and flowsheet data are provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure and requires moderate levels of PEEP. There is a possibility of increased pleural pressures due to increased abdominal pressure, which may lead to further respiratory complications. Esophageal balloon placement might be considered to assess for restrictive chest wall physiology.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever, which could be due to pancreatic inflammation or a superimposed pneumonia. Cultures have been taken, and antibiotics have been initiated to cover possible pneumonia. Close monitoring of infection and adjustment of antibiotic"

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress.  Patient likely has
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  Barriers to
   extubation are the increased intraabdominal pressure from the
   pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions.  Pt may require
   more PEEP given the increased intraabdominal pressure from edema.
   - wean down PEEP as tolerated
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 based on admission labs. No evidence of necrosis on
   OSH imaging
 CT unchanged from OSH per radiology. Most likely
   precipitated by drinking binge consider also hypertriglyceridemia. HCTZ
   can also be associated with pancreatitis
 though I think this is much
   less likely to be the explanation in his case.
   - No new surgery recs as of last night
 will appreciate any new recs
   -monitor Abd exam for abdominal compartment syndrome
   -monitor bladder pressures and UOP
   .
   * Fever
 With persistent fevers up to 104 overnight. Most likely due
   to pancreatitis alone, but need to consider other causes in this man
   with extended ICU admission - both noninfectious (eg acalculous
   cholecystitis, DVT, drug fever) and infectious (line infection, VAP,
   UTI etc). Exam not suggestive of clot. C. diff negative
   - F/u Blood, urine, sputum cultures.
   - Followup remaining OSH micro
   - If cx negative at 72h from today, will d/c antibiotics.
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances (eg hypernatremia). Head CT here
   negative.
   - Haldol prn, check QTC
   - Hold neurontin
   - optimize sedation
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - IV thiamine, MVT, folate
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin drip

   * HTN
   - DC clonidine patch, holding home antihypertensives for now

   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation likely [**2-12**] third
   spacing. Hct now decreased. Transfused 1 unit overnight.
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 **], maintain active T+S

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes and alcoholism who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and pancreatitis. He underwent intubation at the outside hospital due to respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, likely caused by a binge drinking episode. He also has elevated triglyceride levels, which can contribute to pancreatitis. The patient's fever may be related to the pancreatitis but other potential causes such as infections should be considered. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to increased intraabdominal pressure from pancreatitis and bilateral pleural effusions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may require more PEEP due to increased intraabdominal pressure from edema.
2. Pancreatitis: Continued monitoring for abdominal compartment syndrome and assessment of bladder pressures and urine output.
3. Fever: Potential causes include pancreatitis, infections (line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection), drug fever, or other noninfectious causes. Blood, urine, sputum cultures should be followed up, and remaining outside hospital microbiology samples should be reviewed.
4. Agitation: Delirium tremens is less likely since the patient has not consumed alcohol for over 10 days. Other causes such as acute illness, medications, prolonged ICU stay, or electrolyte disturbances should be considered.
5. Alcohol and Substance Abuse: Social work consult is needed, and thiam"

   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress.  Patient likely has
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  Barriers to
   extubation are the increased intraabdominal pressure from the
   pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions.  Pt may require
   more PEEP given the increased intraabdominal pressure from edema.
   -          continue on current vent settings
   -      Leave balloon in place given increasing plateau pressures
   -          monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 No evidence of necrosis on OSH imaging
 CT unchanged
   from OSH per radiology. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge
   consider also hypertriglyceridemia.
   - No new surgery recs as of last night
 will appreciate any new recs
   -monitor Abd exam for abdominal compartment syndrome
   -monitor bladder pressures and UOP
   -continue IVF
   -Nutrition has been shown to be beneficial in pancreatitis
 continue
   tube feeds.
   .
   * Fever
 With persistent fevers up to 104 overnight. Most likely due
   to pancreatitis alone, but need to consider other causes in this man
   with extended ICU admission - both noninfectious (eg acalculous
   cholecystitis (LFTs normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam), drug fever
   (may be due to meropenem)) and infectious (line infection (L IJ tip
   sent for culture), VAP (no evidence on CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). C.
   diff negative
   - F/u Blood, sputum cultures.
   -Continue meropenem, vanco
   -Daily CBC with diff
   - Followup remaining OSH micro
   - If cx negative at 72h from today, will d/c antibiotics.
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation likely [**2-12**] third
   spacing. Hct now decreased. Transfused 1 unit overnight. Hemolysis
   unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T bili normal.
   - Follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - Guiac stools
   - Can check basic b12/folate/iron
   - D/w radiology if fluid in abdomen could be blood rather than fluid.
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances (eg hypernatremia). Head CT here
   negative.
   - Haldol prn, check QTC
 has not needed given sedation
   - Hold neurontin
   - optimize sedation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes and alcoholism who was admitted for acute respiratory failure secondary to pancreatitis. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Key findings from the note include:

1. The patient experienced a multi-lumen exchange and fever of up to 104 degrees overnight.
2. The esophageal balloon showed pleural pressure of 8, suggesting high plateau pressure due to decreased chest wall compliance caused by a swollen abdomen.
3. The patient's Hct level was initially low but improved after transfusion.
4. There were no growths in the UCx and BCx cultures, and the sputum culture showed >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field with no microorganisms seen. MRSA and C. diff tests were pending.
5. The patient's ABG results showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 44 mmHg, and HCO3- 85 mEq/L.
6. The patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 113/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on AC 550x14 with FiO2 40% and PEEP 10.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 104.2°F (40.1°C), blood pressure ranging from 113/65 mmHg to 135/86 mmHg, heart rate between 69-105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has a central venous pressure of 23 mmHg and a bladder pressure of 11 mmHg. He is receiving insulin, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions, as well as other medications such as heparin sodium and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing severe respiratory failure, which is a critical concern. There is a possibility of worsening gas exchange and respiratory distress.
2. Intra-abdominal hypertension: The patient has stable intra-abdominal pressures ranging from 11-14 mmHg. If these pressures continue to rise, there may be a need for drainage of any large collections or consideration of an abdominal release procedure.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is ongoing, and continuous intravenous fluids are being administered. Monitoring of the patient's condition and laboratory values will be necessary.
4. Fever: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on ventilatory support due to severe respiratory failure. The patient has a history of alcoholism and presents with multiple medical complications including intra-abdominal hypertension, fever, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing severe respiratory failure, which requires continuous ventilatory support. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause of respiratory failure is not adequately addressed.

2. Intra-abdominal Hypertension: The patient has stable intra-abdominal hypertension with readings ranging from 11 to 14 mmHg. This condition needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken to prevent complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis, which can lead to local and systemic complications. These complications may include pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, infections, and systemic inflammation.

4. Infection: The patient's fever suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection. In the setting of severe pancreatitis, infections can be difficult to control and may require prolonged antibiotic therapy.

5. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcoholism, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Appropriate management with thiamine and benzodiazepines should be considered to prevent complications like Wernicke"

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress.  Patient likely has
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  Barriers to
   extubation are the increased intraabdominal pressure from the
   pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions.  Pt may require
   more PEEP given the increased intraabdominal pressure from edema.  Pt
   is very PEEP sensitive.
   -          continue on current vent settings
   -      Leave balloon in place given increasing plateau pressures
   -          monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   -          trial of PS at 15/10 when sedation is weaned down and
   patient is more awake
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 No evidence of necrosis on OSH imaging
 CT unchanged
   from OSH per radiology. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge
   consider also hypertriglyceridemia.
   - f/u surgery recs
   -monitor Abd exam for abdominal compartment syndrome
   -monitor bladder pressures, renal function, and UOP
   -continue IVF
   -Nutrition has been shown to be beneficial in pancreatitis
 continue
   tube feeds.
   .
   * Fever
 With persistent fevers up to 104 overnight. Most likely due
   to pancreatitis alone, but need to consider other causes in this man
   with extended ICU admission - both noninfectious (eg acalculous
   cholecystitis (LFTs normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam), drug fever
   (may be due to meropenem)) and infectious (line infection (L IJ tip
   sent for culture), VAP (no evidence on CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). C.
   diff negative
   - F/u Blood, sputum cultures.
   - all cultures have been negative so far - discontinue meropenem, vanco
   - daily CBC with diff
   - Followup remaining OSH micro
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation likely [**2-12**] third
   spacing. Hct 26.6 this AM. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated,
   T bili normal.
   - Follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - Guiac stools
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances (eg hypernatremia). Head CT here
   negative.
   - plan to decrease sedation to better assess mental status and for
   trial of PS
   - Haldol prn, check QTC
 has not needed given sedation
   - Hold neurontin
   - optimize sedation

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes and alcoholism, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and pancreatitis. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 122/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, possibly precipitated by alcohol consumption and hypertriglyceridemia. He also has bilateral pleural effusions and evidence of fluid in the abdomen, which may contribute to increased intraabdominal pressure. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for intubation indicate acute respiratory failure. Factors contributing to this condition include increased intraabdominal pressure from pancreatitis and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely due to a drinking binge and possibly hypertriglyceridemia. No evidence of necrosis on imaging is noted. Monitoring the patient's abdominal exam for abdominal compartment syndrome, bladder pressures, urine output, and continuing tube feeds will be important.

3. Fever: Persistent fe"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with alcoholic pancreatitis and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, intra-abdominal hypertension, pancreatitis, and anemia. The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, insulin, pain management, and prophylactic measures. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he has shown fluctuations in temperature and blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support is being provided through an endotracheal tube with PRVC/AC mode ventilation. His blood gases indicate some abnormalities, and he has a high white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to prevent or treat any potential infections.
2. Pancreatitis Complications: Pancreatitis can lead to various complications, including pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, abscesses, and organ failure. Continuous monitoring of the patient's clinical status and laboratory parameters is essential to identify any signs of worsening pancreatitis or developing complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitates mechanical ventilation support. The risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Intra-abdominal Hypertension: The patient's intra-abdominal pressures are within the high range, indicating a potential risk for abdominal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis, currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Vital signs show fever, with a maximum temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F) and current temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F). Blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits. The patient has a CVP of 13 mmHg and bladder pressure of 15 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 3,455 mL and output of 1,600 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,855 mL. Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, PRVC/AC ventilation mode, set Vt of 550 mL, RR of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 96%. 

Physical examination reveals the patient is intubated, arousable to voice, with regular heart sounds, clear to auscultation bilaterally, and no rashes or jaundice. Neurologic examination shows the patient sedated and not following commands. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with WBC count between 14.0-16.3 K/uL, elevated Hct levels between 24.0-28.9%, and normal platelet count between 610-712 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range or show no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient has severe alcoholic pancreatitis and respiratory failure with stable respiratory compliance.
2. Intra-abdominal hypertension is present but stable at 11-16 mmHg over the last 24 hours.
3. Renal function and urine output remain stable.
4. Pancreatitis is being monitored, with continuous IV fluid administration.
5. Fever is likely due to severe pancreatitis, and follow-up cultures will be obtained.
6. The patient is being weaned off ventilator support and will be transitioned to pressure support.
7. Thiamine and folate supplementation is being administered for alcohol withdrawal.
8. Anemia will be followed up with Hct monitoring.
9. The patient is being provided with nutritional support.
10. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP bundle.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe respiratory failure.
2. Infection or sepsis due to fever and positive blood cultures.
3. Acute kidney injury due to decreased urine output.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome due to intra-abdominal hypertension.
5. Pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
6. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms due to chronic alcohol abuse.
7. Thiamine deficiency leading to Wernicke's encephalopathy.
8. Malnutrition due to prolonged ICU stay and inability to eat."

   39 M w/ alcoholic pancreaitis, severe, respiratory failure, b/l pleural

   Respiratory failure
 compliance stable w/ plat pressures 24-30.  Only
   small bilateral pleural effusions.  No evidence of gas exchange
   abnormality and patient over-breathing on the ventilator.    Given
   stability of respiratory status will attempt to transition to pressure
   support.  Esophageal balloon remains in place in order to re-evaluate
   need for PEEP if respiratory system compliance further changes.
   Intra-abdominal hypertension
 stable at 11-16 over the last 24h.
   Continuing to monitor q4h. .    Renal function and urine output remain
   stable.
   Pancreatitis
 continuing to monitor.  Continuous IVF. No evidence of
   necrotizing process or clear pseudocyst formation (although still
   early) on prior CT.  Possibly IR drainage of large collection raised
   but would get surgical staff opinion on this as can be the beginning of
   a long course and they are often loathe to initate in the absence of
   sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis who is currently in the ICU for severe respiratory failure and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's vital signs show a fever, with a maximum temperature of 103.6°F (39.8°C), and stable blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's respiratory status is being supported by mechanical ventilation, and there are no significant abnormalities in gas exchange. The patient has intra-abdominal hypertension, but it is stable. Renal function and urine output remain stable as well.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to severe alcohol abuse. The patient is receiving continuous IV fluids and will continue to be monitored closely for any signs of necrotizing process or pseudocyst formation. Fever is likely due to severe pancreatitis, and follow-up cultures will be obtained to guide antibiotic therapy. The patient is also being managed for alcohol withdrawal and is receiving thiamine and folate supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing severe respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, possibly leading to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
2. Intra-abdominal Hypertension: The patient has stable intra-abdominal hypertension, which needs to be closely monitored. If left untreated, it can lead to organ dysfunction and increased risk of complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress.  Patient likely has
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  Barriers to
   extubation are the increased intraabdominal pressure from the
   pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions.  Pt may require
   more PEEP given the increased intraabdominal pressure from edema.  Pt
   is very PEEP sensitive.
   -          continue on current vent settings
   -      Leave balloon in place given increasing plateau pressures
   -          monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   -          trial of PS at 15/10 when sedation is weaned down and
   patient is more awake
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 No evidence of necrosis on OSH imaging
 CT unchanged
   from OSH per radiology. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge
   consider also hypertriglyceridemia.
   - f/u surgery recs
   -monitor Abd exam for abdominal compartment syndrome
   -monitor bladder pressures, renal function, and UOP
   -continue IVF
   -Nutrition has been shown to be beneficial in pancreatitis
 continue
   tube feeds.
   .
   * Fever
 With persistent fevers up to 104 overnight. Most likely due
   to pancreatitis alone, but need to consider other causes in this man
   with extended ICU admission - both noninfectious (eg acalculous
   cholecystitis (LFTs normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam), drug fever
   (may be due to meropenem)) and infectious (line infection (L IJ tip
   sent for culture), VAP (no evidence on CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). C.
   diff negative
   - F/u Blood, sputum cultures.
   - all cultures have been negative so far - discontinue meropenem, vanco
   - daily CBC with diff
   - Followup remaining OSH micro
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation likely [**2-12**] third
   spacing. Hct 26.6 this AM. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated,
   T bili normal.
   - Follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - Guiac stools
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances (eg hypernatremia). Head CT here

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and alcoholism who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's medical conditions include pancreatitis, fever, anemia, agitation, and potential substance abuse.

The patient was intubated at the outside hospital (OSH) due to respiratory distress and is likely to have functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization. However, barriers to extubation include increased intraabdominal pressure from pancreatitis and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient may require more PEEP given the increased intraabdominal pressure from edema. The patient is very PEEP sensitive.

The patient's pancreatitis is likely precipitated by a drinking binge and should also be considered in the context of hypertriglyceridemia. Surgery recommendations are being followed, and the patient's abdominal compartment syndrome is being monitored along with renal function, urine output (UOP), and intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient has persistent fevers up to 104 degrees overnight, which could be due to pancreatitis alone, but other causes need to be considered, such as acalculous cholecystitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), drug fever, or line infection. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures have been obtained, and all cultures have been negative so far.

The patient's anemia is very concentrated at initial presentation and is likely third"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress but likely had
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  He tolerated
   CPAP/PS overnight at 17/10.  Barriers to extubation are the increased
   intraabdominal pressure from the pancreatitis, presence of bilateral
   pleural effusions, large PEEP requirement (sensitive given increased
   intraabd pressure), possible total body volume overload.  He is +7 L
   over his stay here but unknown how much fluid he received at the
   outside hospital.
   - weaned to CPAP/PS to [**12-18**] during rounds and will continue to wean as
   tolerated
   - remove esophageal balloon
   - monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - gently diurese for goal -500cc today
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 No evidence of necrosis on OSH imaging
 CT unchanged
   from OSH per radiology. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge
   consider also hypertriglyceridemia.
   - f/u surgery recs and discuss need for f/u imaging to assess for
   possible necrosis
   - clamp NG tube
   -continue IVF
   -continue tube feeds
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   .
   * Fever
 With persistent fevers daily. Most likely due to pancreatitis
   alone, but need to consider other causes in this man with extended ICU
   admission - both noninfectious (eg acalculous cholecystitis (LFTs
   normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam), drug fever (now off abx) and
   infectious (line infection (L IJ tip negative)), VAP (no evidence on
   CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). C. diff negative
   - F/u Blood, sputum cultures.
   - off abx as all cx have been neg so far
   - daily CBC with diff
   - Followup remaining OSH micro
   - use cooling blanket for temp>103-104
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50)
   likely [**2-12**] third spacing. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T
   bili normal.
   - Follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - Guiac stools
   - receiving folate
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances. Head CT here negative.
   - plan to decrease sedation to better assess mental status and work
   towards weaning from vent
   - Haldol prn, check QTC
 has not needed given sedation
   - Hold neurontin
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - IV thiamine, MVT, folate
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   * HTN
   - holding home antihypertensives for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes and alcoholism, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and pancreatitis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pancreatitis, fever, anemia, agitation, and alcohol and substance abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory distress and may have functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization. Barriers to extubation include increased intraabdominal pressure from pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions, large PEEP requirement (sensitive given increased intraab pressure), and possible total body volume overload.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely precipitated by a drinking binge and also hypertriglyceridemia. There is no evidence of necrosis on outside hospital imaging, and CT unchanged from outside hospital per radiology. Surgery recommendations should be followed up, and the need for follow-up imaging to assess for possible necrosis should be discussed.

3. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers daily, most likely due to pancreatitis alone. However, other causes should be considered, such as noninfectious causes like acalculous cholecystitis, DVT, drug fever, or infectious causes like line infection, VAP, or UTI.

4. Anemia: The patient has very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis, complicated by respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has been experiencing daily fevers, but no clinical signs of infection are present, and he has been off antimicrobials since 08/26/2114. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.5°F (39.7°C), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/72 to 176/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. He has stable renal function and urine output. The patient's pancreatitis is severe, and there is no clear evidence of necrotizing process or pseudocyst formation on prior CT scan. Surgery consultation is planned following. The patient is also being monitored for intra-abdominal hypertension, fever, ethanol abuse, anemia, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already a significant concern. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to increased difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation or developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Pancreatitis Complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to various complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseud"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis (alcohol-related), severe and complicated by respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is already compromised due to acute pancreatitis. The presence of small bilateral pleural effusions and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory distress. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to worsening respiratory failure.

2. Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAP): The patient's bladder pressures have been stable at 11-16 over the last 24 hours, indicating ongoing intra-abdominal hypertension. This condition can lead to decreased venous return, reduced cardiac output, and potential organ dysfunction.

3. Pancreatitis complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to various complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocyst formation, infected pancreatic necrosis, and pancreatic fistula. These complications may require surgical intervention or further imaging studies.

4. Fever: The patient has been experiencing daily fever, which is attributed to severe pancreatitis. Monitoring for signs of infection and following up with cultures is essential to prevent and manage potential infections.

5. Ethanol abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts him at risk for complications related to withdrawal, delirium tremens (DTs), and thiamine deficiency. Monitoring for signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yom acute pancreaitis (EtOH), severe, complicated by respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- compliance stable w/ plat pressures 24-30.
   Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Esophageal balloon remains in place
   in order to re-evaluate need for PEEP if respiratory system compliance
   further changes.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Major obstacles to
   extubation include sedation, fluid resusitation and intraabdominal
   pressure/pain.
   INTRA-ABDOMINAL HTN -- Bladder pressures  stable at 11-16 over the last
   24h.  Continuing to monitor q4h.     Renal function and urine output
   remain stable.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- No clear evidence of necrotizing process or
   clear pseudocyst formation (although still early) on prior CT.  Surgery
   Consultation following. Consider repeat imaging in the event of
   clinical decline.
   FEVER -- attributed to severe pancreatitis.  Follow up cultures, one
   set here (48h) and all OSH cultures negative so will plan to d/c
   vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].  Cont to follow cultures closley and may need to reinitiate
   if decompensates.
   EtOH ABUSE -- remains on benzodiazepines while intubated, now beyond
   window for acute withdrawal and DTs.  Thiamine, folate.
   ANEMIA -- monitor serial Hct.  No evidence for acute blood loss.
   Transfuse to Hct >21.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis, complicated by respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has experienced daily fevers but shows no clinical signs of infection and is off antimicrobials. His vital signs include a temperature of 39.7°C (103.5°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 164/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has small bilateral pleural effusions, and major obstacles to extubation include sedation, fluid resuscitation, and intraabdominal pressure/pain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute pancreatitis has led to respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening hypoxia.

2. Intra-abdominal Hypertension: The patient's pancreatitis may cause increased intra-abdominal pressure, which can lead to complications like organ dysfunction or failure.

3. Pancreatitis Complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to various complications, including necrosis, pseudocyst formation, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These complications can worsen the patient's condition and require urgent intervention.

4. Fever: The patient's persistent fevers could indicate an underlying infection or inflammation related to the"

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress but likely had
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  He tolerated
   CPAP/PS overnight at 10/5.  Barriers to extubation are the increased
   intraabdominal pressure from the pancreatitis, presence of bilateral
   pleural effusions, large PEEP requirement (sensitive given increased
   intraabd pressure), possible total body volume overload.  He is +7 L
   over his stay here but unknown how much fluid he received at the
   outside hospital.    Pt was weaned to CPAP/PS to [**10-15**] overnight,
   tolerated SBT this AM well.
   - plan for extubation today
   - continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   - restart lasix drip for goal fluid balance of -1 L to -2 L
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 No evidence of necrosis on OSH imaging
 CT unchanged
   from OSH per radiology. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge
   consider also hypertriglyceridemia.  Abdominal exam is much improved
   this morning, softer, but can also be due to pt having many bowel
   movements.
   - repeat CT abdomen today to reassess pancreas
   - clamp NG tube
   - continue tube feeds
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   .
   * Fever
 With persistent fevers daily. Most likely due to pancreatitis
   alone, but need to consider other causes in this man with extended ICU
   admission - both noninfectious (eg acalculous cholecystitis (LFTs
   normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam), drug fever (now off abx) and
   infectious (line infection (L IJ tip negative)), VAP (no evidence on
   CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). C. diff negative
   - F/U blood cultures
   - No antibiotics unless something grows in cultures.  Cultures have all
   been negative to date.  Pt has already finished empiric course of
   antibiotics.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp>103-104
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50)
   likely [**2-12**] third spacing. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T
   bili normal.  Hct today is 24.0 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances. Head CT here negative.
   - continue to wean sedation for better assessment of mental status
   - Haldol prn agitation
   - hold neurontin
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - change thiamine, MVT, folate from IV to PO
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   * HTN
   - holding home antihypertensives for now
   .
   * Diarrhea
 patient putting out a lot of stool, likely due to
   receiving lactulose for last few days.  If diarrhea continues after
   lactulose has been held, will consider testing for C.diff

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), alcoholism, and pancreatitis.
- He was intubated at the outside hospital for respiratory distress but had functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.
- The patient tolerated CPAP/PS overnight at 10/5 and showed improvement, suggesting that he may be a candidate for extubation.
- Barriers to extubation include increased intraabdominal pressure from pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions, large PEEP requirement, and possible total body volume overload.
- The patient's fever is likely due to pancreatitis, but other causes such as drug fever, line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or urinary tract infection (UTI) should be considered.
- The patient has anemia that is likely third spacing, and hemolysis is unlikely. Monitoring of Hct and maintaining active T+S is recommended.
- The patient is agitated, possibly from acute illness, medications, prolonged ICU stay, or electrolyte disturbances. Weaning of sedation is planned for better assessment of mental status.
- Social work consult is needed for alcohol and substance abuse issues.
- The patient's diabetes management involves continuing insulin sliding scale.
- Blood pressure control is being monitored, and home antihypertensives are currently held.
- Diarrhea"

   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress but likely had
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  He tolerated
   CPAP/PS overnight at 10/5.  Barriers to extubation are the increased
   intraabdominal pressure from the pancreatitis, presence of bilateral
   pleural effusions, large PEEP requirement (sensitive given increased
   intraabd pressure), possible total body volume overload.  He is +7 L
   over his stay here but unknown how much fluid he received at the
   outside hospital.
   - weaned to CPAP/PS to [**10-15**] overnight, trial of SBT this AM
   - plan for possible extubation today
   - monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   - gentle diuresis for goal -500cc today
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 No evidence of necrosis on OSH imaging
 CT unchanged
   from OSH per radiology. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge
   consider also hypertriglyceridemia.
   - f/u surgery recs
   - clamp NG tube
   - continue IVF NS@10cc/hr
   - continue tube feeds
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   .
   * Fever
 With persistent fevers daily. Most likely due to pancreatitis
   alone, but need to consider other causes in this man with extended ICU
   admission - both noninfectious (eg acalculous cholecystitis (LFTs
   normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam), drug fever (now off abx) and
   infectious (line infection (L IJ tip negative)), VAP (no evidence on
   CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). C. diff negative
   - F/u Blood, sputum cultures.
   - off abx as all cx have been neg so far
   - daily CBC with diff
   - use cooling blanket for temp>103-104
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50)
   likely [**2-12**] third spacing. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T
   bili normal.
   - Follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - Guiac stools
   - receiving folate
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances. Head CT here negative.
   - plan to decrease sedation to better assess mental status and work
   towards weaning from vent

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, who was admitted with acute pancreatitis. He has been in the ICU for approximately 10 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's fever, increased intraabdominal pressure, presence of bilateral pleural effusions, and potential volume overload are barriers to extubation. 

The plan is to continue weaning the patient off sedation and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to assess readiness for extubation. The patient's bladder pressure and urine output will be monitored, and a gentle diuresis is planned to achieve a negative fluid balance of at least 500cc today.

In terms of pancreatitis, there is no evidence of necrosis on outside hospital imaging, and the patient's CT scan is unchanged. The most likely cause of pancreatitis is a recent binge drinking episode, but hypertriglyceridemia should also be considered. 

Fever is still present and could be attributed to pancreatitis alone; however, other causes such as infectious sources like line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or urinary tract infection (UTI) should be considered and ruled out. 

The patient also has anemia, which is very concentrated at initial presentation and likely due to third spacing. Hemolysis is unlikely, and the patient's haptoglobin levels are elevated with normal total bilirubin levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis, severe and complicated by respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has shown favorable RSBI and is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials. Bladder pressure is lower. The patient is also dealing with intra-abdominal hypertension, acute pancreatitis, fever, ethanol abuse, anemia, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute pancreatitis has led to respiratory failure, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. The major obstacles to extubation include sedation, fluid resuscitation, and intra-abdominal pressure/pain. Continuous monitoring and ongoing efforts towards extubation are necessary.

2. Intra-abdominal Hypertension: The patient's bladder pressures have been stable at 11-16 over the last 24 hours, now lower. Close monitoring every four hours is required to ensure renal function and urine output remain stable.

3. Acute Pancreatitis: Although there is no clear evidence of necrotizing process or pseudocyst formation on prior CT imaging, surgery consultation has been requested. Repeat imaging may be necessary if the patient's condition declines or if the general surgeon requests it.

4. Fever: Attributed to severe pancreatitis, the fever should be monitored, and follow-up cultures should be negative. Antimicrobials may need to be resumed in the event of clinical de"

Fever is attributed to severe pancreatitis, and cultures have been negative, so antimicrobials have been discontinued. The patient is being monitored closely for any signs of clinical decompensation, which may require restarting antimicrobials. The patient's alcohol abuse history is being managed with benzodiazepines while intubated. Anemia is being monitored, and the patient will be transfused to maintain a Hct >21. The patient is tolerating trophic tube feeding as part of nutritional support. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires ongoing mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. Measures to prevent VAP, such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily spontaneous breathing trials (RSBI), should be continued.

2. Intra-abdominal Hypertension: The patient's elevated"

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress but likely had
   functionally healthy lungs prior to hospitalization.  He tolerated
   CPAP/PS overnight at 10/5.  Barriers to extubation are the increased
   intraabdominal pressure from the pancreatitis, presence of bilateral
   pleural effusions, large PEEP requirement (sensitive given increased
   intraabd pressure), possible total body volume overload.  He is +7 L
   over his stay here but unknown how much fluid he received at the
   outside hospital.    Pt was weaned to CPAP/PS to [**10-15**] overnight,
   tolerated SBT this AM well.
   - plan for extubation today
   - continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   - restart lasix drip for goal fluid balance of -1 L to -2 L
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 No evidence of necrosis on OSH imaging
 CT unchanged
   from OSH per radiology. Most likely precipitated by drinking binge
   consider also hypertriglyceridemia.  Abdominal exam is much improved
   this morning, softer, but can also be due to pt having many bowel
   movements.
   - repeat CT abdomen today to reassess pancreas
   - clamp NG tube
   - continue tube feeds
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   .
   * Fever
 With persistent fevers daily. Most likely due to pancreatitis
   alone, but need to consider other causes in this man with extended ICU
   admission - both noninfectious (eg acalculous cholecystitis (LFTs
   normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam), drug fever (now off abx) and
   infectious (line infection (L IJ tip negative)), VAP (no evidence on
   CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). C. diff negative
   - F/U blood cultures
   - No antibiotics unless something grows in cultures.  Cultures have all
   been negative to date.  Pt has already finished empiric course of
   antibiotics.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp>103-104
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50)
   likely [**2-12**] third spacing. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T
   bili normal.  Hct today is 24.0 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances. Head CT here negative.
   - continue to wean sedation for better assessment of mental status
   - Haldol prn agitation
   - hold neurontin
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - change thiamine, MVT, folate from IV to PO
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   * HTN
   - holding home antihypertensives for now
   .
   * Diarrhea
 patient putting out a lot of stool, likely due to
   receiving lactulose for last few days.  If diarrhea continues after
   lactulose has been held, will consider testing for C.diff
   - discontinue lactulose

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes and alcoholism, who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and pancreatitis. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's fever, worsening atelectasis and pleural effusions, and goal of diuresis suggest potential complications related to his respiratory and kidney functions. His labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal liver function tests. The abdominal CT shows no evidence of necrosis or calcification in the pancreas. The patient's current medications include furosemide, midazolam, and heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for intubation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation mentioned in the note include increased intraabdominal pressure from pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions, large PEEP requirement, and possible total body volume overload.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, likely precipitated by a drinking binge and possibly hypertriglyceridemia. No evidence of necrosis on imaging is noted. Monitoring for signs of worsening, such as decreased urine output, hypotension, worsening abdominal distention, increased abdominal pressure, and decreased hematocrit or increasing white blood cell count, is important.
3. Fever: The patient's persistent fevers"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis who is
   transferred for a higher level of care.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt tolerated CPAP/PS overnight at 10/5, currently tolerating CBT.
   Barriers to extubation are the increased intraabdominal pressure from
   the pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions, large PEEP
   requirement (sensitive given increased intraabd pressure), possible
   total body volume overload.  He is +4.6 L over his stay here but
   unknown how much fluid he received at the outside hospital.  There are
   some concerns over possible ARDS given his low P/F ratio but PaO2 is at
   an acceptable level for trial of extubation.
   - plan for extubation today
   - check post extubation ABG
   - continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   - restart lasix drip for goal fluid balance of -1 L to -2 L
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed now pancreatic necrosis or
   calcification.  Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking binge,
   consider also hypertriglyceridemia.  Abdominal exam is improved this
   morning, not as firm.
   - hold tube feeds for planned extubation
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   .
   * Fever
 Continues to spike fevers daily, most likely due to
   pancreatitis.  Other considerations include both noninfectious (eg
   acalculous cholecystitis (LFTs normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam),
   drug fever (now off abx) and infectious (line infection (L IJ tip
   negative)), VAP (no evidence on CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). Patient is
   C. diff negative.
   - F/U blood cultures
   - No antibiotics unless something grows in cultures.  Cultures have all
   been negative to date.  Pt has already finished empiric course of
   antibiotics.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp>103-104
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50)
   likely [**2-12**] third spacing. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T
   bili normal.  Hct today is 23.9 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Agitation
   Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less
   likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications, prolongued
   ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances. Head CT here negative.
   - continue to wean sedation for better assessment of mental status
   - Haldol prn agitation
   - hold neurontin
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - continue thiamine, MVT, folate
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   * HTN
   - consider restarting home antihypertensives
   .
   * Diarrhea
 diarrhea is much improved.  Was likely due to receiving
   lactulose for last few days.  If diarrhea continues after lactulose has
   been held, will consider testing for C.diff

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and other complications related to his condition. The patient's fever persists, and there are signs of worsening bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. The patient's intraabdominal pressure is increased due to pancreatitis, making extubation challenging. The plan is to extubate the patient today, monitor bladder pressure and urine output, restart lasix for fluid balance goals, and wean sedation as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the presence of bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring and close observation are necessary.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis without signs of necrosis or calcification. It is important to monitor for worsening abdominal symptoms, decreased urine output, hypotension, increased abdominal pressure, and changes in white blood cell count.
3. Fever: The patient continues to have daily fevers, most likely due to pancreatitis. Other potential causes should also be considered, including drug fever, line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. Anemia: The patient has a stable hematocrit level after initial presentation. Monitoring of hemoglobin and hematoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yom acute pancreaitis (EtOH), severe, complicated by respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Good progress.  Continue mechanical ventilation,
   tolerating SBT --> work towards extubation trial.  Major obstacles to
   extubation include sedation, fluid resusitation and intraabdominal
   pressure/pain.  Continue to work towards possible extubation trial
   today.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributable to atalectasis, ARDS.  Monitor SaO2.
   INTRA-ABDOMINAL HTN -- Bladder pressures  stable <10.  Continuing to
   monitor q4h.  Renal function and urine output remain stable.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- Clinically resolving slowly.  No clear evidence
   of necrotizing process or clear pseudocyst formation (although still
   early) on CT yesterday.  Surgery Consultation following.
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
 predominately contraction, attributable to active
   diuresis and NG suctioning.  Plan replete Cl (as KCl) to goal HCO3 <
   28.
   FEVER -- attributed to severe pancreatitis.  Much improved this AM.
   Continue to monitor cultures closely and may need to resume
   antimicrobials in event of clinical decompensation.
   HTN
 optimize anti-HTN medication regimen.
   EtOH ABUSE -- remains on benzodiazepines while intubated, now beyond
   window for acute withdrawal and DTs.  Receivecd thiamine, folate.
   ANEMIA -- monitor serial Hct.  No evidence for acute blood loss.
   Transfuse to Hct >21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating trophic tube feeding @ goal.  Hold
   pending extubation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated but is showing improvement as they are tolerating spontaneous breathing trials. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, with a maximum temperature of 39.4 degrees Celsius, and tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 beats per minute. Blood pressure is high at 200/90 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within normal range at 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of overweight/obesity, thinness, anxiety, or diaphoresis. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or abnormal heart sounds. The respiratory examination is clear bilaterally without crackles, wheezes, or diminished breath sounds. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There is no distention or tenderness noted. The extremities show mild edema in both lower limbs. The neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal tone.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.1 thousand cells per microliter, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.1 grams per deciliter, and an elevated blood glucose level of 147 mg/dL. Kidney function is within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0."

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yom acute pancreaitis (EtOH), severe, complicated by respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Good progress.  Continue mechanical ventilation,
   tolerating SBT --> work towards extubation trial.  Major obstacles to
   extubation include sedation, fluid resusitation and intraabdominal
   pressure/pain.  Continue to work towards possible extubation trial
   today.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributable to atalectasis, ARDS.  Monitor SaO2.
   INTRA-ABDOMINAL HTN -- Bladder pressures  stable <10.  Continuing to
   monitor q4h.  Renal function and urine output remain stable.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- Clinically resolving slowly.  No clear evidence
   of necrotizing process or clear pseudocyst formation (although still
   early) on CT yesterday.  Surgery Consultation following.
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
 predominately contraction, attributable to active
   diuresis and NG suctioning.  Plan replete Cl (as KCl) to goal HCO3 <
   28.
   FEVER -- attributed to severe pancreatitis.  Much improved this AM.
   Continue to monitor cultures closely and may need to resume
   antimicrobials in event of clinical decompensation.
   HTN
 optimize anti-HTN medication regimen.
   EtOH ABUSE -- remains on benzodiazepines while intubated, now beyond
   window for acute withdrawal and DTs.  Receivecd thiamine, folate.
   ANEMIA -- monitor serial Hct.  No evidence for acute blood loss.
   Transfuse to Hct >21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating trophic tube feeding @ goal.  Hold
   pending extubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yom acute pancreaitis (EtOH), severe, complicated by respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Good progress.  Continue mechanical ventilation,
   tolerating SBT --> work towards extubation trial.  Major obstacles to
   extubation include sedation, fluid resusitation and intraabdominal
   pressure/pain.  Continue to work towards possible extubation trial
   today.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributable to atalectasis, ARDS.  Monitor SaO2.
   INTRA-ABDOMINAL HTN -- Bladder pressures  stable <10.  Continuing to
   monitor q4h.  Renal function and urine output remain stable.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- Clinically resolving slowly.  No clear evidence
   of necrotizing process or clear pseudocyst formation (although still
   early) on CT yesterday.  Surgery Consultation following.
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
 predominately contraction, attributable to active
   diuresis and NG suctioning.  Plan replete Cl (as KCl) to goal HCO3 <
   28.
   FEVER -- attributed to severe pancreatitis.  Much improved this AM.
   Continue to monitor cultures closely and may need to resume
   antimicrobials in event of clinical decompensation.
   HTN
 optimize anti-HTN medication regimen.
   EtOH ABUSE -- remains on benzodiazepines while intubated, now beyond
   window for acute withdrawal and DTs.  Receivecd thiamine, folate.
   ANEMIA -- monitor serial Hct.  No evidence for acute blood loss.
   Transfuse to Hct >21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 tolerating trophic tube feeding @ goal.  Hold
   pending extubation.

   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis
   extubated yesterday and oxygenating well with increased agitation
   overnight
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was extubated yesterday and continues to oxygenate well overnight.
   Continued oxygen requirement may be due increased intraabdominal
   pressure from the pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural
   effusions, possible total body volume overload although he was diuresed
   negative 3L, he is still +1.5L for stay but unknown how much fluid he
   received at the outside hospital.  There are some concerns over
   possible ARDS given his low P/F ratio but PaO2 is at an acceptable
   level after extubation yesterday morning.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   - restart lasix drip for goal fluid balance of -1 L
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed no pancreatic necrosis.
   Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking [**Doctor First Name 8366**]. Hypertriglyceridemia
   unlikely as TG elevated but only in 200s.  Abdominal exam is improved
   this morning, not as firm.
   - continue tube feeds
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   .
   * Agitation
 Pt was acutely agitated overnight, requiring haldol x2
   and zyprexa x1. Patient 10+ days out from last drink, therefore
   delirium tremens less likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness,
   medications, prolongued ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances. Head CT
   here negative.
   - Haldol prn agitation
   - hold neurontin
   .
   * Fever
 Continues to spike fevers although not as high, most likely
   due to pancreatitis.  Other considerations include both noninfectious
   (eg acalculous cholecystitis (LFTs normal), DVT (no asymmetry on exam),
   drug fever (now off abx) and infectious (line infection (L IJ tip
   negative)), VAP (no evidence on CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). Patient is
   C. diff negative.
   - F/U blood cultures
   - No antibiotics unless something grows in cultures.  Cultures have all
   been negative to date.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp>103-104
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50)
   likely [**2-12**] third spacing. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T
   bili normal.  Hct today is 26.7 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - continue thiamine, MVT, folate
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   * HTN
 BP 110s-130s by NBP. Restarted cozaar yesterday; HCTZ continues
   to be held.
   - measure BP by noninvasive BP meaurements
   - d/c A-line
   .
   * Diarrhea
 diarrhea is much improved.  Was likely due to receiving
   lactulose for last few days.  If diarrhea continues after lactulose has
   been held, will consider testing for C.diff

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, admitted with acute pancreatitis. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient is now extubated and oxygenating well but experiencing increased agitation. He has a fever of 101.9°F and is at risk for delirium and confusion.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and delirium. The respiratory failure may be due to increased intraabdominal pressure from pancreatitis, bilateral pleural effusions, and possible total body volume overload. The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio raises concerns about the possibility of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), but his PaO2 level is at an acceptable level after extubation.

The pancreatitis is likely precipitated by alcohol consumption, and hypertriglyceridemia is unlikely as triglycerides are only in the 200s. The abdominal exam shows improvement, and the patient should continue with tube feeds. Monitoring for signs of worsening, such as decreased urine output, hypotension, worsening abdominal distention, increased abdominal pressure, and decreasing hematocrit or increasing white blood cell count, is important.

The patient's agitation requires Haldol for symptomatic relief. Delirium tremens is less likely since the patient has not consumed alcohol for 10 days. Other potential causes of delirium include"

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis
   extubated yesterday and oxygenating well with increased agitation
   overnight
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
   Pt was extubated yesterday and continues to oxygenate well overnight.
   Continued oxygen requirement may be due increased intraabdominal
   pressure from the pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural
   effusions, possible total body volume overload although he was diuresed
   negative 3L, he is still +1.5L for stay but unknown how much fluid he
   received at the outside hospital and how much lost via insensible
   losses given fevers.  There were some concerns over possible ARDS given
   his low P/F ratio but PaO2 is at an acceptable level after extubation
   yesterday morning. Pt also has R pleural effusion.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   - goal fluid balance of 500cc-1 L negative : will hold lasix as he is
   auto-diuresing 80-200cc/hr. If not negative at midnight, will give
   lasix.
   .
   # DVT/PT
 LENIs today demonstrate b/l DVTs and CTA demonstrated
   segmental PE. Currently pt may be oxygenating well because of pleural
   effusion and no VQ mismatch given that he has decreased perfusion and
   ventilation.
   -will discuss possible thoracentesis tomorrow given that it may
   increase hypoxemia with VQ mismatch.
   -heparin drip (without bolus per surgery recs)
   .
   * Agitation
 Pt was acutely agitated overnight, requiring haldol x2
   and zyprexa x1. Patient 3 weeks out from last drink, therefore delirium
   tremens less likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from acute illness, medications,
   prolongued ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances. Head CT here negative.
   Also with DVT/PE, which may be contributing to agitation although he is
   not hypoxemic. Concern for benzo withdrawal given extended period of
   versed for sedation vs benzo intoxication from sedation.
   -Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg IV Q4H:PRN CIWA > 12 ; Nte HR will be elevated at
   baseline due to PE, pancreatitis. Please hold for sedation or RR<12.
   - Haldol prn agitation
 prior to giving haldol, will evaluate vitals,
   neuro exam, glucose, hypoxemia, metabolic acidosis, CNS infection
   -continue holding neurontin
   -EKG to evaluate for QT prolongation
   -wife at bedside to help with re-orientation
   .
   # Tachycardia
 Still with increased HR. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to pulmonary
   embolism, pancreatitis, fever, possible benzo withdrawal or combination
   of these.
   -address underlying issues
   -heparin drip for PE
   -lorazepam as above
   .
   * Fever
 Continues to spike fevers although not as high, most likely
   due to pancreatitis. WBC increased today to 16. Other considerations
   include both noninfectious (eg acalculous cholecystitis (LFTs normal),
   drug fever (now off abx) and infectious (line infection (L IJ tip
   negative)), VAP (no evidence on CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). Patient was
   C. diff negative earlier in hospital course. Also, may be due to
   DVT/PE. Also consider pneumonitis as pt just extubated.
   -CXR today.
   - F/U blood cultures
   - No antibiotics unless something grows in cultures.  Cultures have all
   been negative to date.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp if pt uncomfortable.
   - Send C. diff
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed no pancreatic necrosis.
   Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking [**Doctor First Name 8366**]. Hypertriglyceridemia
   may also be cause as TG elevated (only in 200s here), atlhough was 3000
   at OSH.  Abdominal exam is improved this morning, not as firm.  Pt
   pulled out his post-pyloric dobhoff.
   - replace NGT for gastric suction and feeds.
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   -morphine and tylenol PRN for pain
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50)
   likely [**2-12**] third spacing. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T
   bili normal.  Hct today is 26.7 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - continue thiamine, MVT, folate
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   * HTN
 BP remains elevated. Restarted cozaar yesterday.
   - restart HCTZ 25mg daily today
   .
   * Diarrhea
 diarrhea is much improved.  Was likely due to receiving
   lactulose for last few days. Pt continues to have diarrhea although not
   in large volumes.
   -Given fever and increased WBC, send C. diff

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes and alcoholism, currently admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis. He was extubated yesterday and is oxygenating well but experiencing increased agitation overnight. The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, respiratory failure, alcohol abuse, bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and a segmental pulmonary embolism (PE). He is also showing signs of fever, tachycardia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's increased agitation and confusion indicate delirium, which may be caused by acute illness, medications, prolonged ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances, or DVT/PE.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to require supplemental oxygen due to increased intraabdominal pressure from pancreatitis, bilateral pleural effusions, possible total body volume overload, or insensible losses.
3. Bilateral DVTs and PE: The presence of b/l DVTs and a segmental PE pose risks for further thromboembolic events, such as a massive PE or distal embolization. The patient should be started on heparin therapy.
4. Fever: The patient's persistent fevers may be attributed to pancreatitis or other potential causes like acalculous cholecystitis, drug fever, infectious etiologies (line infection, VAP, UTI), DVT/PE"

   39 yom acute pancreaitis (EtOH), severe, complicated by respiratory
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Good progress, now extubated.  Suspect component
   of ARDS.  Monitor RR, SaO2, maintain SaO2 >90%.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributable to atalectasis, ARDS.  Concern for possible
   thromboembolic disease.  Monitor SaO2.
   TACHYCARDIA --  suspect multifactorial, including anxiety, hypovolemia
   (intravascular), withdrawal of medications, and EtOH (late phase of
   DTs).  Would check ECG.  Would obtain LE NIVS to assess for DVT.
   DELIRIUM -- suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy, medications (esp. narcotics), ICU psychosis, or
   EtOH-related.
   INTRA-ABDOMINAL HTN -- Bladder pressures  stable <10.  Continuing to
   monitor q4h.  Renal function and urine output remain stable.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- Clinically improving slowly.  No clear evidence
   of necrotizing process or clear pseudocyst formation (although still
   early) on repeat CT.  Surgery Consultation following.
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
 predominately contraction, attributable to active
   diuresis and NG suctioning.  Plan continue replete Cl (as KCl) to goal
   HCO3 < 28.
   FEVER -- attributed to severe pancreatitis.  Overall improved this AM.
   Continue to monitor cultures closely and may need to resume
   antimicrobials in event of clinical decompensation.   Check stool for
   C. diff.
   HTN
 optimize anti-HTN medication regimen.
   EtOH ABUSE -- remains on benzodiazepines while intubated, now beyond
   window for acute withdrawal and DTs (late).  Receivecd thiamine,

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with acute pancreatitis, severe and complicated by respiratory failure. He remains delirious and confused, anxious, and has intermittent tachypnea. The patient is intubated but extubated yesterday afternoon and remains intubated. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, haloperidol, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are unstable with high fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and potassium levels. There are concerns about potential complications such as respiratory failure, hypoxemia, tachycardia, delirium, intra-abdominal hypertension, pancreatitis, metabolic alkalosis, fever, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis complicated by respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary. Supportive measures like maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and providing mechanical ventilation if needed should be considered.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates possible hypoxemia. Further investigation and treatment are required to address this issue, including identifying and treating the underlying cause, such as atelectasis or thromboembolic disease.
3. Tachycardia:"

","Based on the provided information, the patient has been diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis and is experiencing several potential medical complications. These include respiratory failure, hypoxemia, tachycardia, delirium, intra-abdominal hypertension, acute pancreatitis, metabolic alkalosis, fever, hypertension, ethanol abuse, anemia, and nutritional support.

Respiratory failure is indicated by the patient's need for mechanical ventilation and the suspicion of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Hypoxemia is present, which may be attributed to atelectasis and ARDS. Tachycardia could be due to various factors such as anxiety, hypovolemia, withdrawal of medications, and ethanol intoxication.

Delirium is suspected to be multifactorial, including toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, medications (especially narcotics), ICU psychosis, or ethanol-related causes. Intra-abdominal hypertension is being monitored with bladder pressures stable below 10 mmHg. Acute pancreatitis is clinically improving slowly, and there is no clear evidence of necrotizing process or pseudocyst formation on repeat CT. Metabolic alkalosis is predominately contractional, attributable to active diuresis and NG suctioning.

Fever is attributed to severe pancreatitis but has improved this morning. Cultures should be closely monitored, and antimicrobials may be resumed if there is clinical decompensation. Hypertension requires optimization of the anti-HTN medication regimen. Ethanol abuse"

   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis
   extubated yesterday and oxygenating well with increased agitation
   overnight
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
 pt continues to be on 5L NC.  Continued oxygen
   requirement may be due increased intraabdominal pressure from the
   pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions. Volume overload
   less likely as pt auto-diuresed yesterday and  required fluids back for
   low UOP. He is still +830cc for stay but unknown how much fluid he
   received at the outside hospital and how much lost via insensible
   losses given fevers. Also, pt now has PE. There were some concerns over
   possible ARDS given his low P/F ratio but PaO2 is at an acceptable
   level after extubation 2d ago. Pt also has R pleural effusion.
   - Discussed thoracentesis: PE and pleural effusion are on same side, so
   VQ is matched. If we do [**Female First Name (un) **], this may cause VQ mismatch and pt will
   develop hypoxemia. Per IP attending - effusion is not that big, in
   setting of PE, it's much more important to anti-coagulate. Watch
   effusion with CXR.
   - Goal fluid balance of even today given that pt
s UOP is decreasing
   - Heparin drip for PE
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - Continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   .
   # Sepsis
 pt meets SIRS criteria by HR, RR, WBC count. Now with GPC
   bacteremia in BCx from central venous line and peripheral site.
   Unlikely to be skin contaminant given that it is in two places.
   -Empirically started on vancomycin pending speciation
   -Replace CVL
   -F/u Bcx from [**8-30**]
   .
   # DVT/PT
 LENIs yesterday demonstrate b/l DVTs and CTA demonstrated
   segmental PE. Currently pt may be oxygenating well because of pleural
   effusion and no VQ mismatch given that he has decreased perfusion and
   ventilation.
   -heparin drip (without bolus per surgery recs) given concern for
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
   .
   * Agitation
 Pt placed on CIWA scale given that he did well with test
   dose of ativan, suggesting he may be having benzo withdrawal from
   benzos received for sedation. He was more calm yesterday with ativan
   doses. Patient 3 weeks out from last drink, therefore delirium tremens
   less likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from sepsis, pancreatitis, medications,
   prolongued ICU stay, electrolyte disturbances. Also with DVT/PE, which
   may be contributing to agitation although he is not hypoxemic. Concern
   for benzo withdrawal given extended period of versed for sedation vs
   benzo intoxication from sedation. Head CT here negative.
   -Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg IV Q4H:PRN CIWA > 12 ; Note HR will be elevated at
   baseline due to PE, pancreatitis. Please hold for sedation or RR<12.
   - Haldol prn agitation
 prior to giving haldol, will evaluate vitals,
   neuro exam, glucose, hypoxemia, metabolic acidosis, CNS infection.
   -continue holding neurontin
   -EKG to evaluate for QT prolongation
   -wife at bedside to help with re-orientation
   .
   # Tachycardia
 Still with increased HR. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis,
   pulmonary embolism, pancreatitis, fever, possible benzo withdrawal or
   combination of these.
   -address underlying issues as above
   .
   * Fever
 Fevers decreasing with Tmax 100.5 yesterday. WBC decreased
   today to 15.7 (16.6 yesterday). [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis, pancreatitis. We
   are considiering noninfectious (eg acalculous cholecystitis (LFTs
   normal), drug fever (now off abx) and infectious (line infection (L IJ
   tip negative)), VAP (no evidence on CXR), UTI (UCx negative)). Patient
   was C. diff negative earlier in hospital course. Also, may be due to
   DVT/PE. Also consider pneumonitis as pt just extubated.
   - F/U blood cultures
   - Continue vancomycin.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp if pt uncomfortable.
   - Send C. diff
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed no pancreatic necrosis.
   Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking [**Doctor First Name 8366**]. Hypertriglyceridemia
   may also be cause as TG elevated (only in 200s here), atlhough was 3000
   at OSH.  Abdominal exam is improved this morning, not as firm.  Pt
   pulled out his post-pyloric dobhoff.
   - replace NGT for gastric suction. Have not suctioned out very much
   (300cc overnight).
   - Currently holding feeds
   - Replace NGT with dobhoff (IR or surgery)
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   -morphine and tylenol PRN for pain
   .
   * Anemia - Very concentrated at initial presentation to OSH (hct 50)
   likely [**2-12**] third spacing. Hemolysis unlikely as haptoglobin elevated, T
   bili normal.  Hct today is 26.7 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * HTN
 BP remains elevated. Restarted cozaar and HCTZ yesterday.  HCTZ
   will take time to work and pt may still be in pain, also with PE
   - monitor BP for now.
   .
   * Diarrhea
 diarrhea is much improved although pt continues to have
   diarrhea.  Attributed to receiving lactulose but now with elevated WBC.
   -Given fever and increased WBC, send C. diff
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
   - Social work consult
   - continue thiamine, MVT, folate
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: currenlty NPO; not getting tube feeds.  There was not much
   suctioned out of stomach (total 300cc over night). Could contact IR
   about placing dobhoff (or surgery can place at bedside).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, currently admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis. The patient is extubated and oxygenating well but remains agitated. He has a confirmed diagnosis of bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a small pulmonary embolism (PE). He is on a heparin drip for anticoagulation. The patient also has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci from both central venous line and peripheral site. Empirical vancomycin was started pending speciation. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to increased intra-abdominal pressure from pancreatitis, presence of bilateral pleural effusions, and possible V/Q mismatch. Fluid overload is less likely. The patient's fever is decreasing, and sepsis is suspected. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to sepsis, PE, pancreatitis, and possible benzo withdrawal. His anemia is likely third spacing initially, but now stable. The patient's hypertension remains uncontrolled despite restarting cozaar and HCTZ. His diarrhea has improved, but he continues to have diarrhea. The patient's alcohol and substance abuse should be addressed with a social work consult. The patient's diabetes mellitus requires continued insulin sliding scale. The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP"

 pt continues to be on 5L NC.  Continued oxygen
   requirement may be due increased intraabdominal pressure from the
   pancreatitis given elevated bladder pressure although UOP remains
   60-80cc/hr, PE, or presence of bilateral pleural effusions. Volume
   overload less likely as pt auto-diuresed yesterday and required fluids
   back for low UOP. He is still +830cc for stay but unknown how much
   fluid he received at the outside hospital and how much lost via
   insensible losses given fevers.
   - Discussed thoracentesis: PE and pleural effusion are on same side, so
   VQ is matched. If we do thoracentesis, this may cause VQ mismatch and
   pt could develop hypoxemia. Per IP attending - in setting of PE, it's
   much more important to anti-coagulate than drain thoracentesis,
   although in the long run, it will be more beneficial to remove effusion
   to prevent lung trapping. IP will revisit this and get back to us.
   - Goal fluid balance of even today given that pt
s UOP is decreasing.
   If he becomes negative, give back fluids.
   - Heparin drip for PE
 monitor PTT
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - Continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP

   decreased perfusion and ventilation, as above.
   -heparin drip (without bolus per surgery recs) given concern for
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   -Goal PTT 60-80
   .
   * Agitation
 Pt placed on CIWA scale given that he did well with test
   dose of ativan, suggesting he may be having benzo withdrawal from
   benzos received for sedation. He is more calm overnight although he
   required no ativan.  Patient 3 weeks out from last drink, therefore
   delirium tremens less likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from sepsis,
   pancreatitis, medications, prolongued ICU stay, electrolyte
   disturbances. Also with DVT/PE, which may be contributing to agitation
   as he is hypoxic although O2 sats ok. Head CT here negative.
   -Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg IV Q4H:PRN CIWA > 12 ; Note HR will be elevated at
   baseline due to PE, pancreatitis. Please hold for sedation or RR<12.
   - Haldol prn agitation if ativan does not work

   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed no pancreatic necrosis.
   Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking [**Doctor First Name 8366**]. Hypertriglyceridemia
   may also be cause as TG elevated (only in 200s here), atlhough was 3000
   at OSH.  Abdominal exam is improved this morning, not as firm.  Pt
   pulled out his post-pyloric dobhoff and NGT placed yesterday.
   - Place NGT for gastric suction. Still suctioning quite a bit (300cc
   since MN).
   - Currently holding feeds pending amount suctioned from NGT.
   - Replace NGT with dobhoff (IR or surgery) once amount suctioned
   decreases

   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, currently admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, DVT, and PE. He is extubated but still requires supplemental oxygen. The patient has been experiencing agitation, tachycardia, fever, and respiratory failure. He has positive blood cultures for GPC bacteremia from both central venous line and peripheral sites. He has also demonstrated bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and a small pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient's abdomen is mildly distended with active bowel sounds, and he has a large pseudocyst in the pancreas. He is receiving heparin drip for PE, vancomycin for sepsis, and lorazepam for agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen and has a history of bilateral pleural effusions. This may contribute to hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with fever, tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures for GPC bacteremia. He is currently receiving vancomycin empirically.
3. DVT/PT: The patient has bilateral DVTs, and a CTA confirmed a segmental PE. He is on a heparin drip to prevent further"

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholism. He was admitted with pancreatitis, DVT, and PE. He has been extubated but continues to require oxygen. The patient is calm after receiving a test dose of ativan and has been placed on the CIWA scale for benzodiazepine withdrawal. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis, tachycardia, fever, pancreatitis, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require 5L NC and has a decreased perfusion and ventilation. Pleural effusion and no VQ mismatch may be contributing to his respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria and has GPC bacteremia from both central venous line and peripheral site. Empirically started on vancomycin pending speciation.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has an increased heart rate due to sepsis, pulmonary embolism, pancreatitis, fever, and possible benzo withdrawal.

4. Fever: The patient's fever is decreasing, but it could be due to sepsis, pancreatitis, or DVT/PE. C. diff negative earlier in the hospital course, but second sample pending.

5. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis likely precipitated by alcohol consumption. No pancreatic necrosis seen on CT abdomen.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yom acute pancreaitis (EtOH), severe, complicated by bacteremia
   (line-related) and thromboembolic disease.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Mild.  Remains extubated.  Attributed to
   pulmonary embolism, and suspect component of ARDS.  COntinue heparin.
   Monitor RR, SaO2, maintain SaO2 >90%.  Continue incentive spirometry to
   attempt reexpansion of LLL.
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE -- likely developed in context of severe illness
   (acute pancreatitis) and immobilization, despite prophylaxis.  Continue
   heparin, maintain PTT 60-80.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributable to atalectasis, ARDS.  Concern for possible
   thromboembolic disease.  Monitor SaO2.
   LLL ATALECTASIS -- possible related to left effusion, and possible LLL
   embolism.  Hope to perform left thoracentesis when able to do safely.
   Incentive spirometry.
   TACHYCARDIA --  suspect multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   anxiety, hypovolemia (intravascular), withdrawal of medications, and
   EtOH (late phase of DTs).
   DELIRIUM -- suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy, bacteremia, medications (esp. narcotics), ICU
   psychosis, or EtOH-related.  Slowly improving.  If no improvement, then
   initiate neurological evaluation (head CT, +/- LP, EEG).
   BACTEREMIA -- likely line-related infection.  A-line previously d/c'd.
   Would hope to d/c central line.  Continue VANCO.
   INTRA-ABDOMINAL HTN -- Bladder pressures  stable <20.  Continuing to
   monitor qd.  Renal function and urine output remain stable.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- Clinically improving slowly.  Evidence for
   pseudocyst formation on CT scan.  Surgery Consultation following.
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
 predominately contraction, attributable to active
   diuresis and NG suctioning.  Plan continue replete Cl (as KCl) to goal
   HCO3 < 28.
   FEVER -- attributed to severe pancreatitis, but also component of
   bacteremia.  Overall improved this AM.  Continue to monitor cultures
   closely.
   HTN
 optimize anti-HTN medication regimen.
   EtOH ABUSE -- received benzodiazepines while intubated, now beyond
   window for acute withdrawal and DTs (late).  Receivecd thiamine,
   folate.
   ANEMIA -- monitor serial Hct.  No evidence for acute blood loss.
   Transfuse to Hct >21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 holding for large NG output via NG tube.  Would
   consider replacement of distal feeding tube.  Would not  initiate TPN
   until bacteremia treatment intiiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis, severe and complicated by bacteremia (line-related) and thromboembolic disease. The patient remains extubated and has evidence of bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and a left lung embolism. The patient is awake, alert, and confused but less pronounced. He has a fever of 38.1°C, tachycardia, mild respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and tachypnea. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he has right and left lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The assessment and plan include respiratory distress, thromboembolic disease, hypoxemia, left lower lobe atelectasis, tachycardia, delirium, bacteremia, intra-abdominal hypertension, acute pancreatitis, metabolic alkalosis, fever, hypertension, ethanol abuse, anemia, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has evidence of bilateral DVTs and a left lung embolism, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism. Monitoring oxygen saturation and maintaining it above 90% is important. Incentive spirometry may help re-expand the left lower lobe (LLL) atelectasis"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yom acute pancreaitis (EtOH), severe, complicated by bacteremia
   (line-related) and thromboembolic disease.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Mild.  Remains extubated.  Attributed to
   pulmonary embolism, and suspect component of ARDS.  COntinue heparin.
   Monitor RR, SaO2, maintain SaO2 >90%.  Continue incentive spirometry to
   attempt reexpansion of LLL.
   THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE -- likely developed in context of severe illness
   (acute pancreatitis) and immobilization, despite prophylaxis.  Continue
   heparin, maintain PTT 60-80.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributable to atalectasis, ARDS.  Concern for possible
   thromboembolic disease.  Monitor SaO2.
   LLL ATALECTASIS -- possible related to left effusion, and possible LLL
   embolism.  Hope to perform left thoracentesis when able to do safely.
   Incentive spirometry.
   TACHYCARDIA --  suspect multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   anxiety, hypovolemia (intravascular), withdrawal of medications, and
   EtOH (late phase of DTs).
   DELIRIUM -- suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy, bacteremia, medications (esp. narcotics), ICU
   psychosis, or EtOH-related.  Slowly improving.  If no improvement, then
   initiate neurological evaluation (head CT, +/- LP, EEG).
   BACTEREMIA -- likely line-related infection.  A-line previously d/c'd.
   Would hope to d/c central line.  Continue VANCO.
   INTRA-ABDOMINAL HTN -- Bladder pressures  stable <20.  Continuing to
   monitor qd.  Renal function and urine output remain stable.
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE -- Clinically improving slowly.  Evidence for
   pseudocyst formation on CT scan.  Surgery Consultation following.
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
 predominately contraction, attributable to active
   diuresis and NG suctioning.  Plan continue replete Cl (as KCl) to goal
   HCO3 < 28.
   FEVER -- attributed to severe pancreatitis, but also component of
   bacteremia.  Overall improved this AM.  Continue to monitor cultures
   closely.
   HTN
 optimize anti-HTN medication regimen.
   EtOH ABUSE -- received benzodiazepines while intubated, now beyond
   window for acute withdrawal and DTs (late).  Receivecd thiamine,
   folate.
   ANEMIA -- monitor serial Hct.  No evidence for acute blood loss.
   Transfuse to Hct >21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 holding for large NG output via NG tube.  Would
   consider replacement of distal feeding tube.  Would not  initiate TPN
   until bacteremia treatment intiiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis, severe and complicated by bacteremia (line-related) and thromboembolic disease. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress, which is attributed to pulmonary embolism and suspect component of ARDS. He is also at risk for hypoxemia due to atelectasis and ARDS, as well as thromboembolic disease. The patient has delirium, which is suspected to be multifactorial including toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, bacteremia, medications (especially narcotics), ICU psychosis, or EtOH-related. There is evidence of bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and a left lung embolism. The patient has metabolic alkalosis predominately contraction attributable to active diuresis and NG suctioning. He is also experiencing fever, hypertension, and anemia. The patient is receiving various treatments including heparin, incentive spirometry, nutritional support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition is critical.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism exacerbation: The patient already has evidence of bilateral DVTs and a left lung embolism. If these complications worsen or additional emboli form, it could lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress"

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis, DVT and
   PE, extubated but with continued oxygen requirement, calm overnight
   after test dose of ativan.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
 pt continues to be on 5L NC.  Continued oxygen
   requirement may be due increased intraabdominal pressure from the
   pancreatitis given elevated bladder pressure although UOP remains
   60-80cc/hr, PE, or presence of bilateral pleural effusions. Volume
   overload less likely as pt auto-diuresed yesterday and required fluids
   back for low UOP. He is still +830cc for stay but unknown how much
   fluid he received at the outside hospital and how much lost via
   insensible losses given fevers.
   - Discussed thoracentesis: PE and pleural effusion are on same side, so
   VQ is matched. If we do thoracentesis, this may cause VQ mismatch and
   pt could develop hypoxemia. Per IP attending - in setting of PE, it's
   much more important to anti-coagulate than drain thoracentesis,
   although in the long run, it will be more beneficial to remove effusion
   to prevent lung trapping. IP will revisit this and get back to us.
   - Goal fluid balance of even today given that pt
s UOP is decreasing.
   If he becomes negative, give back fluids.
   - Heparin drip for PE
 monitor PTT
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - Continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   .
   # Sepsis
 pt meets SIRS criteria by HR, RR, WBC count. Now with GPC
   bacteremia in BCx from central venous line and peripheral site.
   Unlikely to be skin contaminant given that it is in two places.
   -Empirically started on vancomycin pending speciation
   -Place 2 PIV and remove R internal jugular CVL.
   -F/u Bcx from [**8-30**]; New cx from [**8-31**]
   .
   # DVT/PT
 LENIs yesterday demonstrate b/l DVTs and CTA demonstrated
   segmental PE. Currently pt may be maintaining good O2 saturation
   because of pleural effusion and no VQ mismatch given that he has
   decreased perfusion and ventilation, as above.
   -heparin drip (without bolus per surgery recs) given concern for
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   -Goal PTT 60-80
   .
   * Agitation
 Pt placed on CIWA scale given that he did well with test
   dose of ativan, suggesting he may be having benzo withdrawal from
   benzos received for sedation. He is more calm overnight although he
   required no ativan.  Patient 3 weeks out from last drink, therefore
   delirium tremens less likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from sepsis,
   pancreatitis, medications, prolongued ICU stay, electrolyte
   disturbances. Also with DVT/PE, which may be contributing to agitation
   as he is hypoxic although O2 sats ok. Head CT here negative.
   -Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg IV Q4H:PRN CIWA > 12 ; Note HR will be elevated at
   baseline due to PE, pancreatitis. Please hold for sedation or RR<12.
   - Haldol prn agitation if ativan does not work
 prior to giving
   haldol, will evaluate vitals, neuro exam, glucose, hypoxemia, metabolic
   acidosis, CNS infection.
   -OOB to chair today
   -continue holding neurontin
   -wife at bedside to help with re-orientation
   -Continue to monitor closely.
   .
   # Tachycardia
 Still with increased HR. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis,
   pulmonary embolism, pancreatitis, fever, possible benzo withdrawal or
   combination of these.
   -address underlying issues as above
   .
   * Fever
 Fevers decreasing with Tmax 100.5 yesterday. WBC decreased
   today to 15.7 (16.6 yesterday). [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis, pancreatitis, or
   DVT/PE. Patient was C. diff negative earlier in hospital course, but
   second sample pending. Also consider pneumonitis as pt just extubated.
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue vancomycin.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp if pt uncomfortable.
   - Send C. diff
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed no pancreatic necrosis.
   Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking [**Doctor First Name 8366**]. Hypertriglyceridemia
   may also be cause as TG elevated (only in 200s here), atlhough was 3000
   at OSH.  Abdominal exam is improved this morning, not as firm.  Pt
   pulled out his post-pyloric dobhoff and NGT placed yesterday.
   - Place NGT for gastric suction. Still suctioning quite a bit (300cc
   since MN).
   - Currently holding feeds pending amount suctioned from NGT.
   - Replace NGT with dobhoff (IR or surgery) once amount suctioned
   decreases
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   -morphine and tylenol PRN for pain although pt has not needed these.
   .
   * HTN
 BP remains elevated. Restarted cozaar and HCTZ.  HCTZ will take
   time to work and pt may still be in pain, also with PE
s, pancreatitis.
   Also question of absorbing medications.
   -Team felt that pt most likely absorbing meds
   -monitor BP for now.
   -if SBP>170, give 5-10mg IV hydralazine
   .
   * Anemia -  Hct today is 26.7 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Diarrhea
 Pt continues to have some stool output. Diarrhea
   attributed to receiving lactulose but now with elevated WBC.
   -Given fever and increased WBC, send C. diff
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
 Social work consult; continue thiamine,
   MVT, folate
   .
   * DM - Continue insulin sliding scale
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: currently NPO; not getting tube feeds.  As there is still
   large amt being suctioned from NGT, will hold tube feeds for one more
   day. Will d/w IR vs surgery about placing post-pyloric dobhoff once
   amount from NGT decreases

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and alcoholism, who presented with acute pancreatitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently in the ICU for ongoing management.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, requiring supplemental oxygen and close monitoring for potential respiratory failure.
- The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of agitation and confusion. He is on a sedation scale and has shown improvement with the administration of lorazepam.
- The patient's temperature has been elevated, but is decreasing, suggesting improvement in his sepsis.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, which is consistent with infection.
- Imaging studies reveal no evidence of pancreatic necrosis.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending, and empiric antibiotic therapy has been initiated.
- Fluid balance continues to be monitored due to concerns of fluid overload and potential complications such as pulmonary edema.
- The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments.
- Nutritional support is currently being withheld due to ongoing diarrhea and gastric suctioning.
- Social work consultation has been requested for substance abuse counseling.

Potential Medical Complications:

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis, DVT and
   PE, extubated but with continued oxygen requirement, calm overnight
   after test dose of ativan.
   .
   * Respiratory Distress
 on 4L O2 via NC.  Continued oxygen requirement
   may be due increased intraabdominal pressure from the pancreatitis
   given elevated bladder pressure, PE, or presence of bilateral pleural
   effusions. Volume overload less likely as pt auto-diuresed yesterday
   and required fluids back for low UOP. His fluid balance is +500cc for
   stay but unknown how much fluid he received at the outside hospital and
   how much lost via insensible losses given fevers.
   - No thoracentesis at this time, anticoagulation is the priority.
   Tapping now could cause VQ mismatch and precipitated hypoxemia.
   - Goal fluid balance of even today given that pt
s UOP is decreasing.
   If he becomes negative, give back fluids.
   - Heparin drip for PE
 monitor PTT
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - can stop getting serial bladder pressures, daily abdominal exams will
   be enough
   .
   # Sepsis
 pt meets SIRS criteria by HR, RR, WBC count. Now with GPC
   bacteremia in BCx from central venous line and peripheral site.
   Unlikely to be skin contaminant given that it is in two places.
   -change vancomycin to nafcillin, continue for 4 more days, today is day
   [**1-14**]
   -Place 2 PIV and remove R internal jugular CVL.
   -F/u Bcx from [**8-30**]; New cx from [**8-31**]
   .
   # DVT/PT
 LENIs yesterday demonstrate b/l DVTs and CTA demonstrated
   segmental PE. Currently pt may be maintaining good O2 saturation
   because of pleural effusion and no VQ mismatch given that he has
   decreased perfusion and ventilation, as above.
   -heparin drip (without bolus per surgery recs) given concern for
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   -Goal PTT 60-80
   .
   * Agitation
 Pt received no benzos on CIWA scale.  Patient 3 weeks out
   from last drink, therefore delirium tremens less likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   delirious from sepsis, pancreatitis, medications, prolongued ICU stay,
   electrolyte disturbances. Also with DVT/PE, which may be contributing
   to agitation as he is hypoxic although O2 sats ok. Head CT here
   negative.
   -d/c CIWA scale
   - Haldol prn agitation if ativan does not work
 prior to giving
   haldol, will evaluate vitals, neuro exam, glucose, hypoxemia, metabolic
   acidosis, CNS infection.
   -OOB to chair today
   -continue holding neurontin
   -wife at bedside to help with re-orientation
   -Continue to monitor closely.
   .
   # Tachycardia
 Still with increased HR. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis,
   pulmonary embolism, pancreatitis, fever, possible benzo withdrawal or
   combination of these.
   -address underlying issues as above
   .
   * Fever
 Fevers decreasing with Tmax 100.5 yesterday. WBC decreased
   today to 15.7 (16.6 yesterday). [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis, pancreatitis, or
   DVT/PE. Patient was C. diff negative earlier in hospital course, but
   second sample pending. Also consider pneumonitis as pt just extubated.
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue vancomycin.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp if pt uncomfortable.
   - Send C. diff
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed no pancreatic necrosis.
   Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking [**Doctor First Name 8366**]. Hypertriglyceridemia
   may also be cause as TG elevated (only in 200s here), atlhough was 3000
   at OSH.  Abdominal exam is improved this morning, not as firm.  Pt
   pulled out his post-pyloric dobhoff and NGT placed yesterday.
   - Place NGT for gastric suction. Still suctioning quite a bit (300cc
   since MN).
   - Currently holding feeds pending amount suctioned from NGT.
   - Replace NGT with dobhoff (IR or surgery) once amount suctioned
   decreases
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, decreased hct or increasing WBC
   -morphine and tylenol PRN for pain although pt has not needed these.
   .
   * HTN
 BP remains elevated. Restarted cozaar and HCTZ.  HCTZ will take
   time to work and pt may still be in pain, also with PE
s, pancreatitis.
   Also question of absorbing medications.
   -Team felt that pt most likely absorbing meds
   -monitor BP for now.
   -if SBP>170, give 5-10mg IV hydralazine
   .
   * Anemia -  Hct today is 25.8 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Diarrhea
 Pt is C. diff negative.  Diarrhea has much improved.  No
   fevers overnight.
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
 Social work consult; continue thiamine,
   MVT, folate
   .
   * DM - Continue insulin sliding scale
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: currently NPO; not getting tube feeds.  As there is still
   large amt being suctioned from NGT, will hold tube feeds for one more
   day. Will d/w IR vs surgery about placing post-pyloric dobhoff once
   amount from NGT decreases

 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis, DVT and
   PE, extubated but with continued oxygen requirement, calm overnight
   after test dose of ativan.
   .
   * Respiratory Failure
 on 4L O2 via NC.  Continued oxygen requirement
   may be due increased intraabdominal pressure from the pancreatitis
   given elevated bladder pressure, PE, or presence of bilateral pleural
   effusions. Volume overload less likely as pt auto-diuresed yesterday
   and required fluids back for low UOP. His fluid balance is +500cc for
   stay but unknown how much fluid he received at the outside hospital and
   how much lost via insensible losses given fevers.
   - Discussed thoracentesis: PE and pleural effusion are on same side, so
   VQ is matched. If we do thoracentesis, this may cause VQ mismatch and
   pt could develop hypoxemia. Per IP attending - in setting of PE, it's
   much more important to anti-coagulate than drain thoracentesis,
   although in the long run, it will be more beneficial to remove effusion
   to prevent lung trapping. IP will revisit this and get back to us.
   - Goal fluid balance of even today given that pt
s UOP is decreasing.
   If he becomes negative, give back fluids.
   - Heparin drip for PE
 monitor PTT
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - Continue to monitor bladder pressure and UOP
   .
   # Sepsis
 pt meets SIRS criteria by HR, RR, WBC count. Now with GPC
   bacteremia in BCx from central venous line and peripheral site.
   Unlikely to be skin contaminant given that it is in two places.
   -Empirically started on vancomycin pending speciation
   -Place 2 PIV and remove R internal jugular CVL.
   -F/u Bcx from [**8-30**]; New cx from [**8-31**]
   .
   # DVT/PT
 LENIs yesterday demonstrate b/l DVTs and CTA demonstrated
   segmental PE. Currently pt may be maintaining good O2 saturation
   because of pleural effusion and no VQ mismatch given that he has
   decreased perfusion and ventilation, as above.
   -heparin drip (without bolus per surgery recs) given concern for
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   -Goal PTT 60-80
   .
   * Agitation
 Pt placed on CIWA scale given that he did well with test
   dose of ativan, suggesting he may be having benzo withdrawal from
   benzos received for sedation. He is more calm overnight although he
   required no ativan.  Patient 3 weeks out from last drink, therefore
   delirium tremens less likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from sepsis,
   pancreatitis, medications, prolongued ICU stay, electrolyte
   disturbances. Also with DVT/PE, which may be contributing to agitation
   as he is hypoxic although O2 sats ok. Head CT here negative.
   -Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg IV Q4H:PRN CIWA > 12 ; Note HR will be elevated at
   baseline due to PE, pancreatitis. Please hold for sedation or RR<12.
   - Haldol prn agitation if ativan does not work
 prior to giving
   haldol, will evaluate vitals, neuro exam, glucose, hypoxemia, metabolic
   acidosis, CNS infection.
   -OOB to chair today
   -continue holding neurontin
   -wife at bedside to help with re-orientation
   -Continue to monitor closely.
   .
   # Tachycardia
 Still with increased HR. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis,
   pulmonary embolism, pancreatitis, fever, possible benzo withdrawal or
   combination of these.
   -address underlying issues as above
   .
   * Fever
 Fevers decreasing with Tmax 100.5 yesterday. WBC decreased
   today to 15.7 (16.6 yesterday). [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis, pancreatitis, or
   DVT/PE. Patient was C. diff negative earlier in hospital course, but
   second sample pending. Also consider pneumonitis as pt just extubated.
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue vancomycin.
   - Use cooling blanket for temp if pt uncomfortable.
   - Send C. diff
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed no pancreatic necrosis.
   Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking [**Doctor First Name 8366**]. Hypertriglyceridemia
   may also be cause as TG elevated (only in 200s here), atlhough was 3000
   at OSH.  Abdominal exam is improved this morning, not as firm.  Pt
   pulled out his post-pyloric dobhoff and NGT placed yesterday.
   - Place NGT for gastric suction. Still suctioning quite a bit (300cc
   since MN).
   - Currently holding feeds pending amount suctioned from NGT.
   - Replace NGT with dobhoff (IR or surgery) once amount suctioned
   decreases
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, increased abd pressure (seen with bladder P),
   decreased hct or increasing WBC
   -morphine and tylenol PRN for pain although pt has not needed these.
   .
   * HTN
 BP remains elevated. Restarted cozaar and HCTZ.  HCTZ will take
   time to work and pt may still be in pain, also with PE
s, pancreatitis.
   Also question of absorbing medications.
   -Team felt that pt most likely absorbing meds
   -monitor BP for now.
   -if SBP>170, give 5-10mg IV hydralazine
   .
   * Anemia -  Hct today is 26.7 and stable.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Diarrhea
 Pt continues to have some stool output. Diarrhea
   attributed to receiving lactulose but now with elevated WBC.
   -Given fever and increased WBC, send C. diff
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
 Social work consult; continue thiamine,
   MVT, folate
   .
   * DM - Continue insulin sliding scale
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: currently NPO; not getting tube feeds.  As there is still
   large amt being suctioned from NGT, will hold tube feeds for one more
   day. Will d/w IR vs surgery about placing post-pyloric dobhoff once
   amount from NGT decreases

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Distress - mild, seems to be more comfortable. Large left
   sided pleural effusion - likely will tap in 1 week after effective
   anticoagulation for now. Has left sided PE, but likely matched defect
   given large amount of atelectasis and limited blood flow.
   - continue to wean supplemental O2
   - incentive spirometer
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE - heparin gtt
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION - likely toxic metabolic with ICU psychosis -
   improving today - continue to monitor. d/c CIWA today, not requiring
   any meds so unlikely to be benzo withdrawal.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE - seems to be improving - abdomen soft, uop okay
   responding to  boluses. Pseudocyst being followed by surgery. Will
   continue serial abd exams,  but can d/c bladder pressures for now.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN) - fever
   curve trending down, has coag neg staph in blood and catheter tip - was
   on vanco, but staph is pansensitive. Will switch to nafcillin - 4 more
   days. Likely fever is mainly related to inflammation from pancreatitis.
 HTN - baseline 150's. On losartan and HCTZ.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which has improved with supplemental oxygen and incentive spirometry. There is a large left-sided pleural effusion, but it is likely due to atelectasis and limited blood flow, so tapping will be done after effective anticoagulation.

The patient also has acute pulmonary embolism (PE), for which they are on heparin. Delirium/confusion is suspected to be toxic metabolic with ICU psychosis, but it is improving. Acute pancreatitis seems to be improving as well, with a soft abdomen and responding uop. A pseudocyst is being followed by surgery. The patient has a fever curve trending down, with coag-negative staph in the blood and catheter tip. The source of infection seems to be controlled, so the antibiotic will be switched to nafcillin for another four days.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently NPO due to high output from the NGT. They may consider placing a post-pyloric feeding tube for enteral nutrition if the output is minimal. Glycemic control is maintained with regular insulin sliding scale, and the patient is on systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. Stress ulcer prophylaxis is also being provided.

Overall, the patient's conditions appear to be improving, but they still require close monitoring in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with initial admission for ethanol withdrawal, acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and now presents with toxic metabolic encephalopathy, large left-sided pleural effusion, and pulmonary embolism (PE)/deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has been intubated but is now extubated. The patient's condition is improving, with mild respiratory distress and less anxiety. The patient's abdomen is distended but softer, and there are no signs of tenderness. The patient has trace pitting edema and is not oriented to place or date but is answering more questions appropriately today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience further respiratory distress due to the large left-sided pleural effusion. Tapping the pleural effusion might be necessary once effective anticoagulation is achieved.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a left-sided PE. Close monitoring and systemic anticoagulation with heparin are recommended.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has toxic metabolic encephalopathy with ICU psychosis. Continuous monitoring is necessary for any changes in mental status.
4. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatitis seems to be improving, close monitoring of abdominal exams and fluid balance is essential.
5. Infection: The patient has coag-negative staph in blood and catheter tip. Switching to n"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute pancreatitis. He was initially admitted for ethanol withdrawal and developed respiratory failure due to tachypnea, which has since improved and he has been extubated. The patient also has toxic metabolic encephalopathy, a large left-sided pleural effusion, and pulmonary embolism (PE)/deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

24-hour events include blood cultures taken, stool culture taken, and multi-lumen stop with autodiuresis of 500cc during the day yesterday. The patient's bladder pressure is 14 mmHg, and he responded well to fluid administration with less than 30cc of urine output overnight. No medications were given on the CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure) scale. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for feeling comfortable without any pain. His vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
- Heart Rate: 94 bpm (94-116 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 154/103 mmHg (115-164/90-108 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 27 breaths per minute (23-37 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 99% on nasal cannula

   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8276**] is a 39M with h/o DM and alcoholism and pancreatitis, DVT and
   PE, extubated but with continued oxygen requirement, calm overnight
   after test dose of ativan.
   .
   * Respiratory Distress
 on 4L O2 via NC.  Continued oxygen requirement
   may be due increased intraabdominal pressure from the pancreatitis, PE,
   or presence of bilateral pleural effusions. Volume overload less likely
   as pt even. His fluid balance is even for stay here.
   - No thoracentesis at this time, anticoagulation is the priority.
   Tapping now could cause VQ mismatch and precipitated hypoxemia.
   - Goal fluid balance of even today.
   - Heparin drip for PE
 monitor PTT
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   - can stop getting serial bladder pressures, daily abdominal exams will
   be enough
   .
   # Sepsis
 pt meets SIRS criteria by HR, RR, WBC count. Now with GPC
   bacteremia in BCx from central venous line and peripheral site. F/u
   cultures 8/20 and [**8-31**] have been NGTD. Unlikely to be skin contaminant
   given that it is in two places.
   -changed vancomycin to nafcillin, continue for 4 more days, today is
   day [**2-14**]
   -F/u IJ tip culture
   .
   # DVT/PT
 Pt with b/l DVTs and CTA demonstrated segmental PE.
   Currently pt may be maintaining good O2 saturation because of pleural
   effusion and no VQ mismatch given that he has decreased perfusion and
   ventilation, as above.
   -heparin drip (without bolus per surgery recs) given concern for
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   -Goal PTT 60-80
   .
   * Agitation
 Pt was agitated and confused overnight. Received extra
   dose 1mg ativan. Patient 3 weeks out from last drink, therefore
   delirium tremens less likely. [**Month (only) 8**] be delirious from sepsis,
   pancreatitis, medications, prolongued ICU stay, electrolyte
   disturbances. Also with DVT/PE, which may be contributing to agitation
   as he is hypoxic although O2 sats ok. Head CT here negative.
   -Ativan PRN
   - Haldol prn agitation if ativan does not work
 prior to giving
   haldol, will evaluate vitals, neuro exam, glucose, hypoxemia, metabolic
   acidosis, CNS infection.
   -OOB to chair today
   -continue holding neurontin
   -wife at bedside to help with re-orientation
   -Continue to monitor closely.
   .
   # Tachycardia
 HR improved with range 84-106. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis,
   pulmonary embolism, pancreatitis, fever, possible benzo withdrawal or
   combination of these.
   -address underlying issues as above
   .
   * Fever
 Fevers decreasing with Tmax 100.2 overnight. WBC again
   increased to 18.3 today. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to sepsis, pancreatitis, or DVT/PE.
   Also consider pneumonitis as pt just extubated. C. diff negative x2.
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue nafcillin
   - Use cooling blanket for temp if pt uncomfortable.
   .
   * Pancreatitis
 CT abdomen showed no pancreatic necrosis.
   Pancreatitis likely precipitated by drinking [**Doctor First Name 8366**]. Hypertriglyceridemia
   may also be cause as TG elevated (only in 200s here), atlhough was 3000
   at OSH.  Abdominal exam is improved this morning, not as firm.  NGT to
   suction all day with low residuals. Pt tolerated clamping without
   vomiting.
   - Currently holding feeds.
   - Replace NGT with dobhoff (IR or surgery) possibly tmrw
   - monitor for signs of worsening including decreased UOP, hypotension,
   worsening abd distention, decreased hct or increasing WBC
   -morphine and tylenol PRN for pain although pt has not needed these.
   .
   * HTN
 BP slightly elevated with SBP 130s-160s. Restarted cozaar and
   HCTZ.  HCTZ will take time to work and pt may still be in pain, also
   with PE
s, pancreatitis.
   -monitor BP for now.
   -if SBP>170, give 5-10mg IV hydralazine
   .
   * Anemia -  Hct today is 25.2 (25.8 yesterday). It is slowly
   decreasing, not at transfusion threshold. No evidence of active
   bleeding.
   - monitor Hct daily
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue folate
   .
   * Diarrhea
 Pt is C. diff negative.  Diarrhea has much improved.  No
   fevers overnight.
   .
   * Alcohol and substance abuse
 Social work consult; continue thiamine,
   MVT, folate
   .
   * DM - Continue insulin sliding scale
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: currently NPO; not getting tube feeds.  Pt tolerated NGT
   being clamped. Will d/w IR vs surgery about placing post-pyloric
   dobhoff tomorrow to resume tube feeds

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcoholism. He is currently admitted to the ICU for several medical complications including acute pulmonary embolism (PE), delirium/confusion, acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, alcohol abuse, and sepsis.

The patient's recent events include being agitated and confused overnight, which improved with the administration of lorazepam (Ativan). His fluid balance has been maintained even for his stay in the ICU. There is a significant decrease in left pleural effusion, but no thoracentesis was performed at this time. The priority is anticoagulation, and if the effusion persists, a thoracentesis may be done in 1-12 weeks once stable on anti-coagulation.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis as he has tachycardia, tachypnea, elevated white blood cell count, and bacteremia from GPC in blood cultures from central and peripheral sites. He is also suspected to have a non-isolated MRSA infection given the increased leukocytosis today. The patient's CBC with Diff shows a left shift but no increased lymphocytes or eosinophils. The antibiotic regimen was changed from vancomycin to nafcillin starting on 08/30.

The patient has a history of bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and a computed tomography angiography"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. They are currently in the ICU and have been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including pulmonary embolism (PE), acute delirium/confusion, acute pancreatitis, fever, respiratory failure (not ARDS), alcohol abuse, and potential VAP. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. Fluid balance indicates an input of 2,220 mL and output of 2,360 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 140 mL. The patient's laboratory results reveal leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated lipase levels. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin, lorazepam, insulin, and antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a diagnosis of PE, which can be a complication of DVT. The risk of developing further blood clots in the deep veins, particularly in the legs, is significant. This can lead to additional pulmonary embolisms or leg pain/swelling.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an infection. Given the presence of an NG tube and potential VAP, there is an increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lip"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted initially for ethanol withdrawal and acute pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure from tachypnea and toxic metabolic encephalopathy. The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary embolism (PE/DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is showing signs of ICU psychosis, which can be attributed to toxic metabolic encephalopathy. Close monitoring is required, and sedation may be necessary.
2. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatitis appears to be improving, it is important to continue serial abdominal exams and monitor for any signs of complications such as pseudocyst formation.
3. Pleural Effusion: The large left-sided pleural effusion may need to be tapped after effective anticoagulation. Rechecking the chest X-ray is recommended to assess if the effusion is resolving.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with a PE. Continuous monitoring for any signs of worsening respiratory distress or new symptoms is crucial. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin is ongoing.
5. Fever: The patient had an initial fever that was likely related to inflammation from pancreatitis. Switching antibiotics to nafcillin was appropriate due to the presence of coag-negative Staphylococcus in the blood and catheter tip. Close observation"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, delirium, acute pancreatitis, fever, respiratory failure, alcohol abuse, and hypothermia. The patient has been receiving various medications including antianxiety medication, antibiotics, insulin, and medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 137/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's neurological examination is nonfocal with occasional lucid questions. Physical examination findings include decreased breath sounds at the left base, tachycardia, distended abdomen, and soft and non-tender bowel sounds. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, and normal kidney and liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal evidence of a pulmonary embolism and pancreatitis. The patient's blood cultures from the central venous line tip and the blood nasal gastric tube both grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. The patient's current assessment and plan include treatment for pulmonary embolism, delirium, pancreatitis, fever, respiratory failure, and alcohol abuse. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon."
