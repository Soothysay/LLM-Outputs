   # Dyspnea: Likely related to fluid overload/HF in the setting of aortic
   stenosis. The patient
s respiratory status improved with IV Lasix last
   night; however, she then developed hypotension and required some fluid
   resuscitation. She had another episode of dyspnea this morning, for
   which she was given additional IV Lasix boluses.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis who underwent balloon valvuloplasty yesterday. She was transferred to the ICU due to flash pulmonary edema and has been experiencing episodes of dyspnea. Her respiratory distress improved with IV Lasix but she developed hypotension and required fluid resuscitation. She had another episode of dyspnea this morning, for which she was given additional IV Lasix boluses. The patient's current conditions include dyspnea, hypotension, coronary artery disease, post-aortic valvuloplasty, urinary tract infection, hypertension, and osteoporosis. The plan is to continue diuresis with slow Lasix gtt, monitor fluid status, fever, and WBC curves, provide ipratropium nebs PRN, restart metoprolol, and hold other antihypertensives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload and heart failure in the setting of aortic stenosis, leading to recurrent episodes of dyspnea.
2. Hypotension due to overdiuresis.
3. Pneumonia, indicated by fever and elevated WBC count.
4. Coronary artery disease with potential ischemia or acute coronary syndrome.
5. Complications related to the recent balloon valvuloplasty.
6. Urinary tract infection, which has been treated but could potentially recur.
7. Hypertension requiring management with antih"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis who was admitted to the CCU for flash pulmonary edema. She has been on various medications including metoprolol, Lasix, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she requires supplemental oxygen. She has had an increase in urine output and a decrease in fluid balance over the past 24 hours. Physical examination shows a systolic murmur and no significant leg edema. Lab results indicate elevated potassium and white blood cell count. The patient's main concerns include dyspnea, hypotension, and a history of coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's shortness of breath may be due to fluid overload and heart failure, especially considering her history of aortic stenosis. Monitoring her fluid status and continuing diuretic therapy with Lasix will be important.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to overdiuresis. Slowing the Lasix infusion and restarting metoprolol should help improve her blood pressure.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): Although the patient's recent troponin levels were within normal range, her history of CAD should be closely monitored. Continuing medications like aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and crestor will help manage her CAD.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis who underwent balloon valvuloplasty and was transferred to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema. She has been experiencing dyspnea likely related to fluid overload and heart failure. The patient's respiratory status improved with IV Lasix last night but she developed hypotension and required fluid resuscitation. She had another episode of dyspnea this morning and received additional IV Lasix boluses. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease with multiple stents, urinary tract infection that has been treated, hypertension, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload and heart failure due to aortic stenosis and flash pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension related to overdiuresis from Lasix.
3. Pneumonia as indicated by fever and white blood cell count.
4. Chest discomfort related to coronary artery disease, although ACS has been ruled out.
5. Back pain and potential vertebral fracture due to prolonged bed rest.
6. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal intubation.
8. Osteoporosis-related complications such as fractures."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis who was transferred to the CCU for flash pulmonary edema. She has been experiencing dyspnea, hypotension, and chest discomfort. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 90/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and crackles at the bases bilaterally. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, sodium level of 135 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, and blood glucose level of 106 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload and heart failure due to aortic stenosis: The patient's history of aortic stenosis and the presence of flash pulmonary edema suggest that she may be experiencing fluid overload and heart failure. This can lead to further pulmonary edema, worsening dyspnea, and hypotension.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates potential hypotension, which can be caused by diuretic use, aortic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis who underwent balloon valvuloplasty. She was transferred to the CCU for flash pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current conditions include dyspnea, hypotension, and chest discomfort. The dyspnea is likely related to fluid overload and heart failure in the setting of aortic stenosis. The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has desaturated to the mid 80s. Lasix gtt has been started for diuresis.

The hypotension is likely related to diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis. Lasix gtt for diuresis has been continued, and all antihypertensives have been held.

The patient's chest discomfort could be related to coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is not likely to be due to ischemia since she had a clean cath on 03/09/21. However, there was a slight troponin bump (peak 0.10) during flash pulmonary edema, which is unlikely to be related to coronary occlusion. The patient is currently on ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, and crestor.

The patient is also a possible candidate for percutaneous valve replacement in the future. Monitoring of volume status, routine care of cath site, and appreciation for any interventional cardiology input are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis, post-balloon valvuloplasty, coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple stents, osteoporosis, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for flash pulmonary edema. The patient's current symptoms include dyspnea, hypotension, and chest discomfort.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fluid Overload/Hear Failure: The patient's dyspnea is likely related to fluid overload and heart failure, especially considering her aortic stenosis. Close monitoring of fluid status and rechecking chest X-ray are necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis. Slow diuresis should be continued to prevent hypotension, and medications like amlodipine, lisinopril, and isosorbide should be held. Metoprolol should be restarted to prevent tachycardia/hypertension and subsequent pulmonary edema.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Although the patient's current symptoms are not likely related to ischemia, as she had a clean catheterization on [date], there was a slight troponin bump in the setting of flash pulmonary edema.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis, post-balloon valvuloplasty, coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple stents, osteoporosis, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She was admitted to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current complaints include dyspnea, hypotension, and chest discomfort. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/70 mmHg to 116/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and crackles at the bases bilaterally, a regular rhythm with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard throughout, loudest at the heart base, and a holosystolic murmur at the apex. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's troponin T level is slightly elevated, but not indicative of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 

The assessment and plan include management of fluid overload and heart failure in the setting of aortic stenosis, hypotension related to diuresis, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis status post valvuloplasty, urinary tract infection, and oste"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis, post-balloon valvuloplasty, coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple stents, osteoporosis, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She was admitted to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema and has been experiencing dyspnea, hypotension, and chest discomfort. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), a heart rate of 55 bpm, a blood pressure of 90/70 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds and crackles at the bases bilaterally, a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur throughout with loudest at the heart base, and additional holosystolic murmur at the apex. Laboratory results show elevated troponin T levels, but no significant changes in other cardiac enzymes or kidney function. The patient's fluid balance indicates a net loss of 1,001 mL over 24 hours. She is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, metoprolol, ASA, Plavix, and Crestor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's ongoing dyspnea may be related to fluid overload or heart failure in the setting of"

   85 year-old female with PMHx of aortic stenosis s/p balloon
   valvuloplasty, transferred from the [**Hospital1 1896**] service to CCU for flash
   pulmonary edema.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely related to fluid overload/HF in the setting of aortic
   stenosis. The patient has a perisistent O2 requirement. She has
   desaturated to the mid 80s with self-d/c of oxygen in the setting of
   delirium. Lasix gtt off.
   - starting 20 mg PO lasix daily
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - recheck CXR
   - sputum cx, considering pt
s cough
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to diuresis in setting of severe aortic
   stenosis.
   - slow diuresis, as above, to prevent hypotension
   - holding amlodipine, lisinopril, isosorbide at this point
   - restarting metprolol to prevent tachycardia/hypertension and
   subsequent pulmonary edema
   .
   # CAD s/p Multiple Stents in the Past: Pt's current symptoms not likely
   related to ischemia, as she had a clean cath on [**2161-3-9**]. However, she
   did complain of some chest discomfort during her recent episode. Ruled
   out for ACS with three sets of CE
s. Had slight troponin bump (peak
   0.10) in setting of flash pulmonary edema, unlikely to be related to
   coronary occlusion.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, metoprolol and crestor
   .
   # Aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty: The patient is status post balloon
   valvuloplasty.  Possible candidate for percutaneous valve replacement
   in future.
   - monitor volume status
   - routine care of cath site
   - appreciate any interventional cardiology input
   .
   # UTI: Per [**Hospital1 **] notes, pt completed course of cipro and now has clean
   urine cx.
   .
   # OSTEOPOROSIS: Per [**Hospital1 1896**] notes, the pateint has been complaining of
   back pain, which was felt to be related to her previous vertebral

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis, post-balloon valvuloplasty, coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple stents, osteoporosis, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She was admitted to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema and was previously transferred from another hospital.
- The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea, which is likely related to fluid overload and heart failure in the setting of aortic stenosis.
- Her oxygen requirement persists, and she desaturated to the mid-80s while self-discontinuing oxygen due to delirium.
- Lasix was given orally but stopped due to the patient not producing much urine.
- The patient also experiences hypotension, which is likely related to diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis.
- Diuretics are being used cautiously to prevent hypotension.
- The patient's CAD symptoms are not likely related to ischemia, as she had a clean catheterization on [**2161-3-9**]. However, she complained of chest discomfort during her recent episode, which was ruled out for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with three sets of cardiac enzyme (CE) tests.
- The patient is a possible candidate for percutaneous valve replacement in the future.

   85 year-old female with PMHx of aortic stenosis s/p balloon
   valvuloplasty, transferred from the [**Hospital1 1896**] service to CCU for flash
   pulmonary edema.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely related to fluid overload/HF in the setting of aortic
   stenosis/mitral regurgitation. The patient has a perisistent O2
   requirement. She has desaturated to the mid 80s with self-d/c of oxygen
   in the setting of delirium. Lasix gtt off.
   - diurese with torsemide 10 mg as tolerated by blood pressure
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to diuresis in setting of severe aortic
   stenosis.
   - slow diuresis, as above, to prevent hypotension
   - holding amlodipine, lisinopril, isosorbide at this point
   - restarted metprolol to prevent tachycardia/hypertension and
   subsequent pulmonary edema
   .
   # CAD s/p multiple stents in the Past: Pt's current symptoms not likely
   related to ischemia, as she had a clean cath on [**2161-3-9**]. However, she
   did complain of some chest discomfort during her recent episode. Ruled
   out for ACS with three sets of CE
s. Had slight troponin bump (peak
   0.10) in setting of flash pulmonary edema, unlikely to be related to
   coronary occlusion.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, metoprolol and crestor
   .
   # Aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty: The patient is status post balloon
   valvuloplasty.  Possible candidate for percutaneous valve replacement
   in future.
   - monitor volume status
   - routine care of cath site
   - appreciate any interventional cardiology input
   .
   # UTI: Per [**Hospital1 **] notes, pt completed course of cipro and now has clean
   urine cx.
   .
   # OSTEOPOROSIS: Per [**Hospital1 1896**] notes, the pateint has been complaining of
   back pain, which was felt to be related to her previous vertebral
   fracture in the setting of lying on her back for days.
   - Continue vitamin D
   - Continue gabapentin
   - continue hydrocodone
   - appreciate PT recs

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis post-balloon valvuloplasty, coronary artery disease with multiple stents, and osteoporosis. She was transferred from the Hospital1 service to the CCU for flash pulmonary edema. She has been experiencing dyspnea, hypotension, and chest discomfort. Her current vitals show a blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient has received several treatments and interventions, including diuretics, vasodilators, beta-blockers, antibiotics, and pain management medications. She also has impaired skin integrity and chronic pain. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's troponin-T levels are slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning for acute coronary syndrome. She has a history of urinary tract infection, which has been treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient's condition includes heart failure, aortic stenosis, and osteoporosis. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, hypotension, infection, and further skin breakdown."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of aortic stenosis, heart failure, and chronic pain. His vital signs are currently stable, but he has a low oxygen saturation level of 89% on nasal cannula. He is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating in the 90s, so torsemide was held. Foley catheter was discontinued, and the patient was called out to the floor. The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and unknown allergens. The patient's weight is currently 49.2 kg, which is an increase from his admission weight of 47.6 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is low at 89%, indicating potential hypoxemia. This could be due to respiratory issues or inadequate oxygen delivery.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently in the 90s, suggesting ongoing hypotension. This may be related to heart failure or other underlying conditions.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid (1,000 mL) but has lost more than that (-645 mL) over the past 24 hours. This indicates a potential fluid imbalance, which could contribute to pulmonary"

   # Dyspnea: Likely related to fluid overload/HF in the setting of aortic
   stenosis/mitral regurgitation. The patient has a perisistent O2
   requirement. She has desaturated to the mid 80s with self-d/c of oxygen
   in the setting of delirium. Lasix gtt off.
   - diurese with torsemide 10 mg as tolerated by blood pressure
   - continue to monitor fluid status

   # Hypotension: Likely related to diuresis in setting of severe aortic
   stenosis.
   - slow diuresis, as above, to prevent hypotension
   - holding amlodipine, lisinopril, isosorbide at this point
   - restarted metprolol to prevent tachycardia/hypertension and
   subsequent pulmonary edema

   # CAD s/p multiple stents in the Past: Pt's current symptoms not likely
   related to ischemia, as she had a clean cath on [**2161-3-9**]. However, she
   did complain of some chest discomfort during her recent episode. Ruled
   out for ACS with three sets of CE
s. Had slight troponin bump (peak
   0.10) in setting of flash pulmonary edema, unlikely to be related to
   coronary occlusion.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis who was admitted to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including cough, impaired skin integrity, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), aortic stenosis, and heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/47 mmHg to 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. She has mild crackles at the bases of her lungs and a systolic murmur that is loudest at the right upper sternal border.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes. Her glucose levels are within normal range, and her troponin-T level is slightly elevated but not above the critical value.

The patient's assessment and plan include several components:
1. COUGH: The patient likely has a cough related to fluid overload and heart failure in the setting of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
2. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to immobility or pressure ulcers.
3. PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): The patient requires pain"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of multiple myocardial infarctions, aortic stenosis, and mitral valve regurgitation. She was admitted to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema and is currently experiencing hypotension, dyspnea, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. Her cardiac examination reveals a soft c-d SEM at the right upper sternal border and a holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. Lung examination shows crackles 1/3 up with desaturation to the 80s during weaning. The patient's abdomen is soft with no hepatic stigmata or tenderness, but there are large ecchymoses at the site of hepatic surgery. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities are warm and well-perfused without peripheral edema. The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.0-11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 32.5-38.1 g/dL, platelet count of 160-206 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0-1.2 mg/dL, and glucose levels of 86-102 mg/dL. The patient has been diagnosed with cough, impaired skin integrity, pain control (acute and chronic), aortic stenosis, and heart failure (diastolic, acute). The assessment plan includes diuresis with torsemide, monitoring fluid status, and continuing isotropic support. The patient is also being held on amlodipine, lisinopril, and isosorbide due to hypotension. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low (97/47 mmHg), which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Dyspnea: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated (24 breaths per minute), and she has an oxygen saturation of 89%, indicating possible respiratory distress or insufficiency.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has large ecchymoses at the site of hepatic surgery, which may lead to wound complications or infection.
4. Aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain, syncope, and heart failure.
5. Heart failure (diastolic, acute): The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest acute diastolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and poor cardiac output.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient has been complaining of back pain related to a previous vertebral fracture, indicating a risk of further bone fractures and related complications.
7. UTI: Although the patient completed a course"

   diuretic. Torsemide held y/d [**2-3**] hypotension. BP
s in low 100
s, good
   UOP.
   -attempt diurese with torsemide 10 mg as tolerated by blood pressure
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   -continue IS
   # Hypotension: Likely related to diuresis in setting of severe aortic
   stenosis.
   - slow diuresis, as above, to prevent hypotension
   - holding amlodipine, lisinopril, isosorbide at this point
   - restarted metprolol to prevent tachycardia/hypertension and
   subsequent pulmonary edema

   # CAD s/p multiple stents in the Past: Pt's current symptoms not likely
   related to ischemia, as she had a clean cath on [**2161-3-9**]. However, she
   did complain of some chest discomfort during her recent episode. Ruled
   out for ACS with three sets of CE
s. Had slight troponin bump (peak
   0.10) in setting of flash pulmonary edema, unlikely to be related to
   coronary occlusion.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, metoprolol and crestor

   # Aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty: The patient is status post balloon
   valvuloplasty.  Possible candidate for percutaneous valve replacement
   in future.
   - monitor volume status
   - routine care of cath site
   - appreciate any interventional cardiology input

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of multiple myocardial infarctions (MI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to three vessels, aortic stenosis status post balloon valvuloplasty, and transferred from the cardiology service to the critical care unit (CCU) for flash pulmonary edema.

The patient presented with dyspnea, likely related to fluid overload and heart failure in the setting of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. She also had some component of congestive heart failure (CHF) on lung exam, partly due to sensitive fluid shifts due to aortic stenosis, as well as atelectasis. The patient desaturated to the mid-80s with self-discontinuation of oxygen in the setting of delirium. She was diuresed 645cc without diuretic, and torsemide was held due to hypotension.

The patient's blood pressure readings were in the low 100s, with good urine output. The plan was to attempt diuresis with torsemide 10 mg as tolerated by blood pressure, continue to monitor fluid status, and continue intravenous fluids (IS).

The patient was also found to have hypotension, likely related to diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis. Slow diuresis was recommended to prevent hypotension, and medications such as amlodip"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of multiple myocardial infarctions, aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. She was admitted to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema and has been experiencing dyspnea, which is likely related to fluid overload and heart failure. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, for which she underwent stent placement, but her current symptoms are not indicative of ischemia. She underwent a balloon valvuloplasty for aortic stenosis and may be a candidate for percutaneous valve replacement in the future. The patient previously had a urinary tract infection, which has since been treated with ciprofloxacin. She also has a history of osteoporosis and complains of back pain related to a previous vertebral fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the low 100s, which could indicate hypotension. This may be related to diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, suggesting fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen heart failure symptoms.
3. Delirium: The patient has shown signs of delirium, which can be exacerbated by fluid shifts, hypotension, or other factors.
4. Chest discomfort: Although the patient's recent cardiac catheterization ruled out"

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical history including multiple myocardial infarctions with percutaneous coronary intervention to three vessels, aortic stenosis status post balloon valvuloplasty, and transferred from the [Hospital1 1896] service to CCU for flash pulmonary edema. The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea, likely related to fluid overload/heart failure in the setting of aortic stenosis/mitral regurgitation. The patient has a persistent O2 requirement but is also on home O2 at bedtime, has some component of CHF on lung exam, and is very sensitive to fluid shifts due to AS. There is also some atelectasis. She desaturated to the mid-80s with self-d/c of oxygen in the setting of delirium. The patient diuresed 965cc yesterday without diuretic.

Assessment and plan:
1. Dyspnea: Continue to hold diuretics and allow autodiuresis. Monitor fluid and respiratory status. Continue IS.
2. Hypotension: Allow autodiuresis, as above. Hold amlodipine, lisinopril, isosorbide at this point. Continue metoprolol to prevent tachycardia/hypertension and subsequent pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of multiple myocardial infarctions, aortic stenosis, and mitral valve regurgitation. She was admitted to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema and is currently on the cardiac service. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea, which is likely related to fluid overload and heart failure in the setting of her aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. She also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is on home oxygen at bedtime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely due to fluid overload and heart failure, but it can also be exacerbated by COPD exacerbations. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and fluid balance is crucial to prevent further episodes of dyspnea.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis. Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and fluid status is important to prevent hypotension.
3. UTI: Although the patient completed a course of ciprofloxacin and now has clean urine culture, there is still a risk of developing a urinary tract infection due to catheter use. Regular monitoring of urine output and urinalysis can help identify any signs of infection.
4. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis and back"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of multiple myocardial infarctions, aortic stenosis post balloon valvuloplasty, and mitral regurgitation. She was admitted to the ICU for flash pulmonary edema. The patient's current condition includes dyspnea likely related to fluid overload and heart failure in the setting of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. She also has persistent oxygen requirements and shows signs of atelectasis on lung exam. The patient has undergone significant diuresis without the use of diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis. It is important to monitor the patient's fluid and respiratory status while allowing autodiuresis.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's dyspnea and lung exam findings suggest fluid overload due to heart failure. Continuous monitoring of fluid status is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis may worsen over time, potentially leading to cardiac complications. Monitoring the patient's volume status and considering percutaneous valve replacement in the future is important.
4. Delirium: The patient has experienced episodes of delirium. It is crucial to assess and manage any contributing factors such as medication side effects, infection, or metabolic imbalances."
