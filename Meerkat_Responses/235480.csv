   Imaging: CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo with a ESRD on HD, with recent prolonged hospitalization for
   incarcerated hernia, complicated by ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia recently
   on Vancomycin and Meropenem, who presents with dyspnea while at HD.
   Dyspnea
   Differential includes bacteria and viral pneumonia. CXR shows clear
   large infiltrate. Given recent hospitalization, he should be covered
   for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on Vancomycin and Meropenem
   for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would add Levofloxacin for better
   pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1 vaccine, however given
   tachypnea, would empirically treat with oseltamavir. Differential
   always includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo
   from [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. Given that the patient was at HD, it is
   possible that fluid overload is contributing to dyspnea.
   -Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])

   -continue coumadin
   -monitor INR: goal [**2-25**]
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Not documented, but patient on Keppra as an outpatient.
   -continue Keppra at outpatient doses
   -continue zonisamide

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with severe shortness of breath after hemodialysis, with a clinical history of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
- The patient has been hospitalized for an incarcerated hernia, complicated by ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, for which he was recently treated with vancomycin and meropenem.
- The patient presents with dyspnea while at HD and has a clear large infiltrate on chest X-ray.
- Given the recent hospitalization, the patient should be covered for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Levofloxacin has been added for better pulmonary coverage.
- Empirical treatment with oseltamavir has been initiated due to tachypnea, and the possibility of influenza infection is being investigated.
- The patient's ejection fraction is 45-50% based on an echo from 12-1.
- Fluid overload is suspected as a contributing factor to the patient's dyspnea.
- The patient's blood cultures are being followed up, and a repeat CXR will be done in the morning.
- Recent Klebsiella ESBL bacteremia was treated with vancomycin and meropenem, which were due to be completed on 1-28. It is unclear if this treatment was stopped at the rehabilitation facility or if the ID planned to continue it.
- Nephrology is aware of the patient's ESRD on HD.
- The patient has a history of CAD"

   Prior head CT [**2110-12-14**] shows MCA territory infarction of anterior MCA
   territory bilaterally, both insular cortices, most of basal ganglia on
   right, sparing of parietal, occipital and medial-most frontal cortex.
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   infiltrate.
   Dyspnea
   Differential includes bacteria and viral pneumonia. CXR shows clear
   large infiltrate. Given recent hospitalization, he should be covered
   for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on Vancomycin and Meropenem
   for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would add Levofloxacin for better
   pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1 vaccine, however given
   tachypnea, would empirically treat with oseltamavir. Differential
   always includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo
   from [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. Given that the patient was at HD, it is
   possible that fluid overload is contributing to dyspnea.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, multiple CVD on coumadin, HTN, CAD, GERD, chronic HBV, and recent hospitalization for hernia repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia. He presented to the ICU with severe shortness of breath after hemodialysis and was found to have respiratory failure in the ED with a left lung infiltrate on CXR. He has been on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Meropenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), as well as Oseltamavir for suspected H1N1 infection. The patient's recent Klebsiella ESBL bacteremia was followed by ID on the last hospitalization, and he was to complete Vancomycin and Meropenem on 1/28. The patient's ECG shows a regular rhythm with RBBB and normal intervals, similar to the prior ECG on 12/14. The patient's assessment includes dyspnea with a large infiltrate on CXR, and he is being treated for HAP and suspected H1N1 infection. Other medical issues include ESRD on HD, CAD, cerebrovascular disease, seizure disorder, chronic hepatitis B, and depression.

   Imaging:
   Prior head CT [**2110-12-14**] shows MCA territory infarction of anterior MCA
   territory bilaterally, both insular cortices, most of basal ganglia on
   right, sparing of parietal, occipital and medial-most frontal cortex.
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   - Continue ASA, statin, with caution for DAH
   - Hold BB and ACEI tonight. Consider restarting in the AM if BP
   tolerates.
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   Noted to have vascular dementia and previous likely embolic strokes on
   coumadin
 no documented AF noted on review of past notes. Largest
   changes cerebrovascular/embolic (not hypertensive, but given history of
   hypertension, may also be superimposed and cause of some large vessel
   cerebrovascular disease) with bilateral MCA disease with good
   collateral supply and no watershed. Also ventricular enlargement.
   Equivalent to very posterior lobotomy anatomically.
   - Hold coumadin given present INR and possible DAH (consider bridge
   when falls)
   - Monitor INR: goal [**2-25**] if decide on coumadin otherwise lowish goal for
   PTT if concern for DAH
   - Discuss goals of care with family
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Per note of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 12731**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4021**] [**2110-8-6**], post-stroke seizure with
   two events. On Keppra as an outpatient.
   - Continue Keppra at outpatient doses (but after HD, not before)
   - Continue zonisamide
   Chronic Hepatitis B
   - Monitor liver enzymes
   Depression
   - Continue fluoxetine
   Access
   Probably with concern for bilateral fistulae, was PICC power placed as
   tunneled to IJ.
   - Discuss with IR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, chronic hepatitis B, and a recent hospitalization for hernia repair and abscess. The patient presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath after hemodialysis and was found to have respiratory failure. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), blood pressure of 142/68 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient is sedated but able to interact meaningfully at times.

Physical examination findings include a clear oropharynx, supple neck, no jugular venous distention, clear lung sounds bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, midline abdominal scar with a small hematoma, warm and well-perfused extremities, and signs consistent with upper motor neuron lesions.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18,100/mm3, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride of 100 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 35 mg/dL, creatinine of 6.6 mg/dL, glucose of 75 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 28.0 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal pulmonary edema and a left lung infiltrate.

The patient's medical history includes seizures for which he is on coumadin, hypertension, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic hepatitis B, and previous hospitalization for ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. He is currently on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and meropenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema with possible superimposed infection, fever possibly from pneumonia or other sources, recent Klebsiella ESBL bacteremia, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory status due to worsening pulmonary edema or superimposed infection.
2. Development of sepsis secondary to the ongoing infection.
3. Progression of kidney injury or worsening renal function.
4. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Neurological deterioration due to the underlying cerebrovascular disease.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immob"

   Imaging:
   Prior head CT [**2110-12-14**] shows MCA territory infarction of anterior MCA
   territory bilaterally, both insular cortices, most of basal ganglia on
   right, sparing of parietal, occipital and medial-most frontal cortex.
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   infiltrate.
   Dyspnea
   Likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Throthy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1
   vaccine, however given tachypnea, would empirically treat with
   oseltamavir, albeit less likely. Differential always includes MI and
   PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from [**12-1**] shows EF
   45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high creatinine with
   clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of severe shortness of breath after hemodialysis, possible pneumonia or congestive heart failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Physical examination reveals a dialysis catheter tip at the level of the superior vena cava, cardiomegaly with diffuse interstitial edema, and a more confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises concern for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax.

The patient has several medical conditions including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, multiple cardiovascular diseases on coumadin with a possible history of seizures, hypertension, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic hepatitis B, and a recent hospitalization for hernia repair/abscess/ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. The patient was on antibiotics until January 28th.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 141/71 mmHg, pulse rate of 93 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on FiO2 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 176 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 135 mg/dL, potassium of 4"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old individual with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and multiple prior cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). The patient has been hospitalized for an incarcerated hernia and developed an ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, which has been treated with vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to left-sided pneumonia and volume overload. The treatment plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and levofloxacin for pneumonia, as well as dialysis to manage ESRD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the pneumonia is not effectively treated or if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which has already been addressed with elevation of the head of bed (HOB), mouth care, and daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). The patient's critically ill condition increases the risk of further complications such as infection, bleeding due to systemic anticoagulation, and potential cardiovascular events.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, and electrolyte levels to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M ESRD on HD, multiple strokes (on coumadin for prophylaxis),
   HTN, CAD, GERD, chronic HBV, recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 12717**] for
   hernia repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia on antibiotics until [**2111-1-28**]
   developed SOB at HD today. Developed respiratory failure in ED, CXR
   with L lung infiltrate.
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure/status post Extubation
   Stable to improved. Status post collapse of right lung likely secondary
   to mucous plug and resolving with chest PT. Initial presentation likely
   likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Frothy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Differential always
   includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from
   [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high
   creatinine with clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative. Flu
   negative by swab and given H1N1 vaccine.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   - Obtain PM CXR and AM CXR to assess interval improvement of right
   mucous plug and right lung volume aeration
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # Fever
   Possible from PNA, sepsis, fistula site, pelvic abscess, line
   infection,
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Follow up CXR
   - Consider line removal (see access below)
   - Follow fever curve; pan culture if spikes
   # Access
   Probably with concern for bilateral fistulae, was PICC power placed as
   tunneled to IJ. Will discuss with IR if spikes.
   - Follow blood cultures and remain sensitive to possible line infection
   (signs attributable to PNA for now)
   # Recent Klebsiella ESBL Bacteremia
   Followed by ID on last hospitalization. Vanc and Meropenem were due to
   be completed on [**1-28**]. Unclear if this was stopped at rehab, or if ID
   planned to continue it.
   - Follow blood cultures and remain sensitive to possible line infection
   (signs attributable to PNA for now)
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   ESRD on HD
   Plan for HD [**2-12**].
   - Follow renal recommendations
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Continue to renally dose medications
   CAD
   ROMI negative.
   - Continue ASA, statin, BB, ACEi
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   Noted to have vascular dementia and previous likely embolic strokes on
   coumadin
 no documented AF noted on review of past notes. Largest
   changes cerebrovascular/embolic (not hypertensive, but given history of
   hypertension, may also be superimposed and cause of some large vessel
   cerebrovascular disease) with bilateral MCA disease with good
   collateral supply and no watershed. Also ventricular enlargement.
   Equivalent to very posterior lobotomy anatomically.
   - Restart Coumadin, INR goal [**2-25**]
   - Discuss goals of care with family
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Per note of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 12731**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4021**] [**2110-8-6**], post-stroke seizure with
   two events. On Keppra as an outpatient.
   - Continue Keppra at outpatient doses (but after HD, not before)
   - Continue Zonisamide
   Chronic Hepatitis B
   - Monitor liver enzymes
   Depression
   - Continue Fluoxetine
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, soft dysphagia/mechanical diet
   # Prophylaxis: Coumadin
   # Access: PIV x1, R tunneled PICC on right chest into IJ placed on

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M ESRD on HD, multiple strokes (on coumadin for prophylaxis),
   HTN, CAD, GERD, chronic HBV, recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 12717**] for
   hernia repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia on antibiotics until [**2111-1-28**]
   developed SOB at HD today. Developed respiratory failure in ED, CXR
   with L lung infiltrate.
   # Dyspnea
   Likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Throthy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Differential always
   includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from
   [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high
   creatinine with clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative x 2.
   Flu negative by swab and given H1N1 vaccine.
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   - f/u blood cultures
   # Respiratory Failure and Ventilation
   Likely as above. Concern for DAH also and edema. s/p extubation.
   - Eval CXR
   # Fever
   Possible from PNA, sepsis, fistula site, pelvic abscess, line
   infection,
   - Blood culture, follow CXR
   - Consider line removal (see access below)
   - Follow curve
   - Consider u/s of fistula sites (right and left)
   # Access
   Probably with concern for bilateral fistulae, was PICC power placed as
   tunneled to IJ.
   - Discuss with IR
   - Follow blood cultures and remain sensitive to possible line infection
   (signs attributable to PNA for now)
   Recent Klebsiella ESBL Bacteremia
   Followed by ID on last hospitalization. Vanc and Meropenem were due to
   be completed on [**1-28**]. Unclear if this was stopped at rehab, or if ID
   planned to continue it.
   - F/u blood cultures, repeat
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem per above for HAP coverage
   - Med list from rehab. To see if completed course, or if course
   continued
   ESRD on HD
   HD for this a.m. with goal to be negative.
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins
   CAD
   ROMI negative.
   - Continue ASA, statin, with caution for DAH
   - Hold BB and ACEI tonight. Consider restarting in the AM if BP
   tolerates.
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   Noted to have vascular dementia and previous likely embolic strokes on
   coumadin
 no documented AF noted on review of past notes. Largest
   changes cerebrovascular/embolic (not hypertensive, but given history of
   hypertension, may also be superimposed and cause of some large vessel
   cerebrovascular disease) with bilateral MCA disease with good
   collateral supply and no watershed. Also ventricular enlargement.
   Equivalent to very posterior lobotomy anatomically.
   - Hold coumadin given present INR and possible DAH (consider bridge
   when falls)
   - Monitor INR: goal [**2-25**] if decide on coumadin otherwise lowish goal for
   PTT if concern for DAH
   - Discuss goals of care with family
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Per note of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 12731**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4021**] [**2110-8-6**], post-stroke seizure with
   two events. On Keppra as an outpatient.
   - Continue Keppra at outpatient doses (but after HD, not before)
   - Continue zonisamide
   Chronic Hepatitis B
   - Monitor liver enzymes
   Depression
   - Continue fluoxetine
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Stop subcutaneous heparin given possible DAH and high

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple strokes, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic hepatitis B, and a recent hospitalization for hernia repair/abscess/ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. The patient developed shortness of breath at HD and subsequently developed respiratory failure in the emergency department (ED). The chest X-ray (CXR) showed a large infiltrate in the left lung, indicating a possible pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/67 to 175/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. Other lab results include elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and lactate levels. The troponin-T levels are within normal range. The electrolyte levels are somewhat abnormal, with low potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and calcium (Ca++) levels.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been hospitalized for an incarcerated hernia and subsequently developed an ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to left-sided pneumonia and volume overload. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Prolonged or recurrent respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is caused by left-sided pneumonia and volume overload. If not properly managed, this could lead to prolonged respiratory failure or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Recurrent or resistant infection: The patient has a history of ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. There is a risk of recurrence or development of resistant infections if appropriate antimicrobial therapy is not administered or if the patient develops antibiotic resistance during treatment.

3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of multiple prior cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.

4. Renal complications: As the patient has ESRD, there is an ongoing need for dialysis to manage renal function. Any further deterioration in renal function could exacerbate the patient's condition.

5. Complications related to invasive procedures: The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including a PICC line, arterial line, and mechanical ventilation. These invasive procedures carry their own"
