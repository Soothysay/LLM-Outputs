   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The pt is a 78 yo male with pulmonary asbestosis,
   retroperitoneal fibrosis, DVT, a fib, new chylous ascities and pleural
   effusion who presented to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in respiratory distress.  He is now
   s/p thoracentesis and new onset hypothermia and hypotension.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: Likely due to re-accumulated pleural effusion
   and compressive atelectasis. Last tap was [**2196-11-10**] and then was repeated
   on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Now s/p 2 L tap (no PTX on CXR) with no
   pigtail placed in hopes of not worsening nutrition given unknown
   etiology of chylous fluid. Also could be due to ground glass opacities
   (infectious vs inflammatory) on CT scan from [**2196-10-12**].
   -follow up pleural fluid cytology, flow cytology, culture
   -started on cefepime and vancomycin for ? HAP especially given ground
   glass opacity, hypothermia on arrival, hypoxia, and hypotension
   -send sputum culture
   -f/u culture results
   -incentive spirometry
   .
   #. Chylous ascities/pleural fluid: Etiology of chylous pleural
   effusion/ascities likely RP fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction.  DDX
   includes infection, malignancy, trauma to lymphatic system.  Pt treated
   for SBP with last dose of CTX on [**2196-11-9**].
   -GI following
   -pulm recs PET CT
   -consider MRI of pancreas once ARF improved
   -nutrition consult for diet to reduce formation of chylous effusion
   -consider octreotide trial
   -daily weights
   .
   #. DVT: restarted heparin gtt, currently supratherapeutic
   -follow PTT and dose heparin appropriately
   .
   #. Hypotension: Had SBP 80s-90s overnight, responsive to fluid
   boluses.  Likely related to post-procedural fluid shifts. No evidence
   of pneumothorax. Hct stable. Will need to consider PE in setting of
   known DVT if hypotension persists.  Low suspicion for sepsis.
   -ensure 2 large bore peripherals; trend Hct, maintain active T+S
   -holding home rate control/BP meds
   .
   #. A fib:
   -heparin for now given procedures
   -hold rate control given hypotensive after thoracentesis
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Pre-renal vs. renal etiology.  U/S
   yesterday with no obstruction but suboptimal given pt cannot hold a
   deep breath.  Will need to consider whether it is possible that
   retroperitoneal fibrosis could be related to renal failure.
   -trend creatinine
   -appreciate renal recs
   -consider repeat renal u/s if pt can hold breath in AM
   -bladder pressure checked and normal
   -check urine lytes
   .
   #. Scrotal cellulitis: s/p 10 day tx of vancomycin now resolved.
   Finished vancomycin course on [**11-11**]
   -continue topical antifungal tx
   .
   #. Diarrhea: improved on loperamide. C diff neg x1.
   -continue to monitor
   -no bowel regimen
   .
   #. Hernias: No signs of strangulation.
   -no surgical plans at this time
   .
   #. Rash:
   -continue triamcinolone [**Hospital1 **]

","Based on the provided physician progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with several medical conditions including pulmonary asbestosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation (A fib), new-onset chylous ascites and pleural effusion, acute on chronic renal failure, scrotal cellulitis (resolved), diarrhea, multiple hernias, and a rash. The patient presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and underwent a thoracentesis. He is currently experiencing hypothermia and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient may experience further respiratory distress due to re-accumulated pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. This could potentially lead to hypoxia and respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Chylous ascites/pleural fluid: The patient has chylous pleural effusion and ascites, which may be due to retroperitoneal fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction. Infection, malignancy, or trauma to the lymphatic system are possible differential diagnoses. The patient is being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and other potential causes such as infection or malignancy should be considered. Nutritional support and further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause and guide treatment.

3. DVT: The patient has a known DVT and is currently on he"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels, which can be caused by pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. This condition needs to be managed promptly to ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Chylous ascites/pleural fluid: The patient has developed chylous ascites and pleural fluid, which is an accumulation of milky fluid in the abdomen and around the lungs. This can lead to complications such as infection, abdominal distention, and respiratory compromise. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of this condition.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, and anticoagulation therapy with heparin is ongoing. Close monitoring of the patient's coagulation status and prevention of clot formation are essential.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by fluctuating creatinine levels. It is important to identify the underlying cause of renal failure and initiate appropriate management to prevent further deterioration.

   Disposition:  ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including pulmonary asbestos, retroperitoneal fibrosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation (A fib), new-onset chylous ascites and pleural effusion, acute renal failure, scrotal cellulitis, diarrhea, hernias, and a rash. The patient presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and has since undergone thoracentesis, which is the removal of fluid from the pleural space.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: This is likely due to reaccumulated pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. The patient has undergone two large-bore thoracentesis procedures, but there is a possibility of recurrence.

2. Chylous ascites/pleural fluid: The patient has developed chylous ascites and pleural effusion, which may be secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis, surgical trauma, tuberculosis infection, or lymphoma. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on heparin therapy. There is a risk of further clot formation or pulmonary embolism if anticoagulation is inadequate.

4. A fib: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may contribute to hypotension and the need for rate control"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including pulmonary asbestos, retroperitoneal fibrosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation (AFib), new-onset chylous ascites, and tracking pleural effusion. He presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and underwent thoracentesis. The patient is currently experiencing hypothermia, hypotension, and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is mostly due to reaccumulated pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation of the blood and subsequent hypoxia.

2. Chylous ascites/pleural fluid: The patient has developed chylous ascites and pleural fluid, which may be due to retroperitoneal fibrosis, surgical trauma, tuberculosis infection, or lymphoma. This condition can lead to fluid accumulation in the abdomen and around the lungs, causing compression of vital organs and impaired lung function.

3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on heparin therapy. If left untreated or if the heparin therapy is ineffective, there is a risk of further clot formation, potentially leading to pulmonary embolism and compromised blood flow to the lungs.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an increase"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The pt is a 78 yo male with pulmonary asbestosis,
   retroperitoneal fibrosis, DVT, a fib, new chylous ascities and pleural
   effusion who presented to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in respiratory distress.  He is now
   s/p thoracentesis and new onset hypothermia and hypotension.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: Likely due to re-accumulated pleural effusion
   and compressive atelectasis. Last tap was [**2196-11-10**] and then was repeated
   on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Now s/p 2 L tap (no PTX on CXR) with no
   pigtail placed in hopes of not worsening nutrition given unknown
   etiology of chylous fluid. Also could be due to ground glass opacities
   (infectious vs inflammatory) on CT scan from [**2196-10-12**].
   -follow up pleural fluid cytology, flow cytology, culture
   -started on cefepime and vancomycin for ? HAP especially given ground
   glass opacity, hypothermia on arrival, hypoxia, and hypotension
   -send sputum culture
   -f/u culture results
   -incentive spirometry
   .
   #. Chylous ascities/pleural fluid: Etiology of chylous pleural
   effusion/ascities likely RP fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction.  DDX
   includes infection, malignancy, trauma to lymphatic system.  Pt treated
   for SBP with last dose of CTX on [**2196-11-9**].
   -GI following
   -pulm recs PET CT
   -consider MRI of pancreas once ARF improved
   -nutrition consult for diet to reduce formation of chylous effusion
   -consider octreotide trial
   -daily weights
   .
   #. DVT: restarted heparin gtt, currently supratherapeutic
   -follow PTT and dose heparin appropriately
   .
   #. Hypotension: Had SBP 80s-90s overnight, responsive to fluid
   boluses.  Likely related to post-procedural fluid shifts. No evidence
   of pneumothorax. Hct stable. Will need to consider PE in setting of
   known DVT if hypotension persists.  Low suspicion for sepsis.
   -ensure 2 large bore peripherals; trend Hct, maintain active T+S
   -holding home rate control/BP meds
   .
   #. A fib:
   -heparin for now given procedures
   -hold rate control given hypotensive after thoracentesis
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Pre-renal vs. renal etiology.  U/S
   yesterday with no obstruction but suboptimal given pt cannot hold a
   deep breath.  Will need to consider whether it is possible that
   retroperitoneal fibrosis could be related to renal failure.
   -trend creatinine
   -appreciate renal recs
   -consider repeat renal u/s if pt can hold breath in AM
   -bladder pressure checked and normal
   -check urine lytes
   .
   #. Scrotal cellulitis: s/p 10 day tx of vancomycin now resolved.
   Finished vancomycin course on [**11-11**]
   -continue topical antifungal tx
   .
   #. Diarrhea: improved on loperamide. C diff neg x1.
   -continue to monitor
   -no bowel regimen
   .
   #. Hernias: No signs of strangulation.
   -no surgical plans at this time
   .
   #. Rash:
   -continue triamcinolone [**Hospital1 **]

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of pulmonary asbestos, retroperitoneal fibrosis, DVT, atrial fibrillation, new chylous ascites, and pleural effusion. The respiratory distress may be due to re-accumulated pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. The patient has already undergone thoracentesis twice, but the underlying cause of the chylous fluid needs to be identified. There is also a possibility of ground glass opacities on the CT scan, which could be infectious or inflammatory in nature.

2. Chylous ascites/pleural fluid: The etiology of the chylous pleural effusion/ascites is likely related to retroperitoneal fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction. Differential diagnosis includes infection, malignancy, and trauma to the lymphatic system. The patient has been treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with the last dose of CTX on [2196-11-9].

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on heparin gtt. It is important to monitor the patient's PTT and adjust the heparin dose accordingly.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to post-procedural fluid shifts. The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The pt is a 78 yo male with pulmonary asbestosis,
   retroperitoneal fibrosis, DVT, a fib, new chylous ascities and pleural
   effusion who presented to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in respiratory distress.  He is now
   s/p thoracentesis and new onset hypothermia and hypotension.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: Likely due to re-accumulated pleural effusion
   and compressive atelectasis. Last tap was [**2196-11-10**] and then was repeated
   on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Now s/p 2 L tap (no PTX on CXR) with no
   pigtail placed in hopes of not worsening nutrition given unknown
   etiology of chylous fluid. Also could be due to ground glass opacities
   (infectious vs inflammatory) on CT scan from [**2196-10-12**].
   -follow up pleural fluid cytology, flow cytology, culture
   -started on cefepime and vancomycin for ? HAP especially given ground
   glass opacity, hypothermia on arrival, hypoxia, and hypotension
   -send sputum culture
   -f/u culture results
   -incentive spirometry
   .
   #. Chylous ascities/pleural fluid: Etiology of chylous pleural
   effusion/ascities likely RP fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction.  DDX
   includes infection, malignancy, trauma to lymphatic system.  Pt treated
   for SBP with last dose of CTX on [**2196-11-9**].
   -GI following
   -pulm recs PET CT
   -consider MRI of pancreas once ARF improved
   -nutrition consult for diet to reduce formation of chylous effusion
   -consider octreotide trial
   -daily weights
   .
   #. DVT: restarted heparin gtt, currently supratherapeutic
   -follow PTT and dose heparin appropriately
   .
   #. Hypotension: Had SBP 80s-90s overnight, responsive to fluid
   boluses.  Likely related to post-procedural fluid shifts. No evidence
   of pneumothorax. Hct stable. Will need to consider PE in setting of
   known DVT if hypotension persists.  Low suspicion for sepsis.
   -ensure 2 large bore peripherals; trend Hct, maintain active T+S
   -holding home rate control/BP meds
   .
   #. A fib:
   -heparin for now given procedures
   -hold rate control given hypotensive after thoracentesis
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Pre-renal vs. renal etiology.  U/S
   yesterday with no obstruction but suboptimal given pt cannot hold a
   deep breath.  Will need to consider whether it is possible that
   retroperitoneal fibrosis could be related to renal failure.
   -trend creatinine
   -appreciate renal recs
   -consider repeat renal u/s if pt can hold breath in AM
   -bladder pressure checked and normal
   -check urine lytes
   .
   #. Scrotal cellulitis: s/p 10 day tx of vancomycin now resolved.
   Finished vancomycin course on [**11-11**]
   -continue topical antifungal tx

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of pulmonary asbestos, atrial fibrillation, retroperitoneal fibrosis, left common femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chylous effusion following thoracentesis. He presented with shortness of breath and a large chylous pleural effusion. The patient's worsening rash prompted the discontinuation of antibiotics, which were previously given due to negative cultures. Heparin was temporarily held but later restarted. A pigtail catheter was placed to drain 2 liters of chylous fluid, resulting in relief of dyspnea and tachypnea. The patient experiences mild pain at the catheter insertion site and minimal splinting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of left common femoral vein DVT. There is a risk of further clot formation or extension of the existing clot due to immobilization, malignancy, or other underlying conditions.

2. Hypoxemia/Respiratory Failure: The large chylous pleural effusion can cause respiratory distress and compromise oxygenation. The effusion could be related to malignancy or underlying fibrosis. Fluid sent for cytology to determine the cause.

3. Rash: The patient developed a rash consistent with a drug eruption, possibly due to the antibiotics he was receiving. Stopping the antibiotics improved the rash, but it remains stable"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of pulmonary asbestosis, atrial fibrillation, retroperitoneal fibrosis, left common femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chylous effusion after thoracentesis. He presented with shortness of breath and a large chylous pleural effusion. The patient's worsening rash was observed, leading to the discontinuation of antibiotics due to negative cultures. Heparin was temporarily held but later restarted. A pigtail catheter was placed to drain 2 liters of chylous fluid, resulting in improved dyspnea and tachypnea. The patient experienced mild pain at the catheter insertion site and minimal splinting. 

24-hour events included the placement of a pigtail catheter and drainage of chylous fluid, which relieved respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 98/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. His ABG results indicated a pH of 7.29. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds on the right side, right lower extremity edema, and a stable rash. 

Lab results showed a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, plate"

   #. Hypotension: Resolved, likely related to post-procedural fluid
   shifts. No evidence of pneumothorax. Hct stable. Will need to consider
   PE in setting of known DVT if hypotension persists.  Low suspicion for
   sepsis.
   -ensure 2 large bore peripherals; trend Hct, maintain active T+S

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including pulmonary asbestos, retroperitoneal fibrosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation (AFib), new chylous ascites, and pleural effusion. He presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and underwent thoracentesis. The patient's current assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory distress: This is likely due to re-accumulated pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. The patient had a previous thoracentesis, and a pigtail catheter placement is planned today to help manage the pleural effusion. It is also possible that the respiratory distress could be caused by ground glass opacities seen on the CT scan, which could be due to an infectious or inflammatory process.

2. Chylous ascites/pleural fluid: The etiology of the chylous pleural effusion/ascites is likely related to retroperitoneal fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction. Other potential causes include infection, malignancy, or trauma to the lymphatic system. The patient was treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) previously.

3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently restarted on heparin gtt. Close monitoring of the PTT and appropriate dosing of heparin will be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary asbestosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation (AFib), new-onset chylous ascites and pleural effusion, and acute on chronic renal failure. He presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing hypotension and hypothermia. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to re-accumulated pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. The repeated thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement were done to alleviate the symptoms. The ground glass opacities seen on the CT scan may indicate an infectious or inflammatory process, which needs further evaluation.
2. Chylous ascites/pleural fluid: The etiology of the chylous pleural effusion/ascites is likely retroperitoneal fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction. Other potential causes include infection, malignancy, or trauma to the lymphatic system. The patient is being treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and further investigations are planned to determine the exact cause.
3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on heparin therapy. Close monitoring of the PTT ("

The patient has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, which is consistent with pre-renal etiology. His creatinine levels are stable, and he will need close monitoring.

He also has a history of scrotal cellulitis, which has resolved after treatment with vancomycin. He should continue topical antifungal therapy.

He presented to the ICU in respiratory distress and has undergone thoracentesis, pigtail catheter placement, and renal ultrasound with Doppler.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is at risk of recurrent respiratory distress due to re-accumulated pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Close monitoring and incentive spirometry are recommended.

2. Chylous ascites/pleural fluid: The etiology of chylous pleural effusion/ascites is likely due to retroperitoneal fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause, and the patient may require ongoing management for fluid accumulation.

3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on heparin therapy. Regular monitoring of PTT levels and appropriate adjustment of heparin dosage are necessary to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation.

   Assessment and Plan
  DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY:  Adjust IV heparin
   given subtherapeutic PTT.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Worsening Cr, up to 2.1 today in
   setting of large volume plueral fluid removal after pigtail catheter,
   transient hypotension.  Likely intravascular depletion given fluid
   shifts.  Holding antihypertensives.
 HYPOTENSION:  Fluid shifts, intravascular depletion.  Responsive to
   IVF boluses.  Need to match I/Os.  Surveillance cultures given elevated
   WBC but suspicion for infection is low.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, CHYLOUS:  Pigtail catheter in place.  STill
   draining large volume.  Folllow up on cytology. Wean oxygen as
   tolerated.
   Otherwise agree with assessment and plan as per medical ICU housestaff

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pleural effusion and has undergone chest tube placement. They have been intermittently hypotensive after the placement of a pigtail catheter and large volume pleural fluid removal, but responded to intravenous fluids (IVFs). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate (HR) of 97 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 85/50 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on continuous heparin infusion and other ICU medications. 

The patient's review of systems is positive for dyspnea and lower extremity edema. Flowsheet data shows negative fluid balance with significant output through drains. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.3 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.5 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 411 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.1 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 136 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 5.1 mEq/L, and glucose of 131 mg/dL. 

The patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute on chronic renal failure, hypotension, and chylothorax. The plan includes adjusting IV heparin, holding antihypertensives, providing IVF boluses, matching input/output (I/Os), surveillance cultures, and weaning oxygen as tolerated. 

Nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers are being provided. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of pulmonary asbestosis, chylous pleural effusions, DVT, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension. He was admitted with a large ventral hernia, multiple large other hernias, and a large scrotal hernia. He underwent pigtail catheter placement for drainage of chylous pleural exudate and showed marked improvement in right-sided pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, requiring 6 liters of nasal cannula oxygen, and is hypotensive. His renal function has worsened, indicating acute on chronic renal failure. The patient also has a rash that could be due to a drug reaction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chylous Pleural Effusion: The cause of the chylous pleural effusion is unclear, and it could be related to retroperitoneal fibrosis, lymphatic obstruction, infection, malignancy, or trauma. Further evaluation is needed, including follow-up pleural fluid cytology, flow cytology, culture, and imaging studies.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to post-procedural fluid shifts. There is low suspicion for sepsis, and the patient's blood pressure responds well to fluid resuscitation with normal saline.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is critically ill. They have a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypoxemia, cellulitis, ascites, atrial fibrillation (AFib), pleural effusions, acute renal failure, and anemia. The patient was previously in AFib with rapid ventricular response, which may have been caused by the removal of nodal agents. They are now on a diltiazem infusion and oral agents have been restarted. If there is no response to diltiazem, amiodarone may be considered. There is no evidence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) or acute ischemia. The patient does not have recent fever or evidence of pericarditis, and their thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be checked. Pleural effusions are stable, with a pigtail catheter in place. There is concern about protein malnutrition due to the large drainage of chylous effusion, so a high protein diet should be continued. Serum albumin is mildly reduced. Renal function is improving, and electrolytes are acceptable. Hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and there is no evidence of active bleeding. A rash persists, but it does not appear to be cellulitis, and it may be a drug rash from prior antibiotics. Heparin should continue for AFib. The patient's code status is full code, and"

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Poor rate control given nodal blockade
   held on the medical floor in setting of borderline blood pressures.
   Continues on the diltiazem drip, transition to oral meds and if his
   rate remains stable will be okay to go back to the medical floor later
   today.
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: Supratherapeutic PTT,
   adjust heparin accordingly.
  HYPOXEMIA: Oxygen to maintain saturations >93%.
  HYPOTENSION:  Multifactorial in setting of high losses, poor po
   intake, low albumin.  Will benefit from rate control and maintain
   adequate intravascular repletion.  Enhancing nutrition will be
   important in this context.
  CHYLOUS PLEURAL EFFUSION:  Chest tube in place, continues to put out
   large volumes.  Matching output with IVF given persistent poor po
   intake.  Continues on octreotide.
  ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr improving with fluid
   replacement.  Good urine output.
 NUTRITION:  PICC line placed, anticipating starting TPN today if CXR
   confirms this is in good position.
  RASH:  Most suggestive of drug eruption, ?abx earlier in his
   course.  Continue topical cream.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation, right ventricular overload, and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for various medical conditions, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), hypoxemia, hypotension, chylous pleural effusion, acute on chronic renal failure, and a rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Poor rate control in atrial fibrillation may lead to symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
2. Supratherapeutic PTT indicates a potential risk of bleeding due to excessive anticoagulation. This could result in spontaneous bleeding or increased risk of hemorrhage during invasive procedures.
3. Hypoxemia can lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues, resulting in symptoms such as confusion, cyanosis, and organ damage.
4. Hypotension can cause inadequate blood flow to vital organs, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, organ failure, and shock.
5. Chylous pleural effusion, if not managed properly, can lead to recurrent fluid accumulation in the pleural space, potentially compromising lung function and causing respiratory distress.
6. Acute on chronic renal failure indicates a worsening of pre-existing kidney dysfunction. If left untreated, it can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
7. Malnutrition or inadequate nutrition can"
