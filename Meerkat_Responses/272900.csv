   CT of HEAD:  IMPRESSION: Scattered areas with low attenuation in the
   subcortical white matter as described above, more conspicuous on the
   right frontal lobe, consistent with the previously demonstrated
   thromboembolic ischemic changes, and there is no evidence of
   hemorrhagic transformation, mass,mass effect, or shifting of the
   normally midline structures. Persistent prominent sulci at the left
   frontal region, followup in this area is recommended. If there is any
   clinical concern related with new ischemic area, correlation with MRI
   is recommended if clinically warranted.
   - repeat Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20-25%).  There is a very small pericardial effusion,
   no signs of tamponade.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
   of [**2184-3-15**], ejection fraction is now severely depressed. The right
   ventricle, although not well seen, is dilated and hypokinetic. There is
   a small amount of pericardial fluid seen adjacent to the right atrium,
   without evidence of tamponade physiology.
   - MRI of C-spine and head: 1. Limited study due to motion. 2. No
   definite brainstem or cord signal abnormality. 3. Mild to moderate
   spinal canal stenosis at C3-4, with probable at least moderate neural
   foraminal narrowing at this level as well, though evaluation of the
   neural foramina is markedly limited due to motion.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval
   development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive,
   asystolic, and pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   #Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The first documented rhythm
   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  New RIJ was started but femoral TL was not pulled (1 positive
   blood culture from the femoral site
 GPC in clusters).
   -vancomycin, zosyn
   -f/u bld, urine cx
   -head imaging pending clinical improvement.
   -c-spine MRI pending clinical improvement
   -need to get LP when warmed
   -trend lactate (presistently elevated to 5.1
 likely [**1-20**] to peripheral
   vasoconstriction).
   .
   #Respiratory status: oxygenating well on current settings,
   hyperventilating as well.
   - on vent continue current settings
   .
   #Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.29/30/79.  likely due to cardiac
   disfunction, poor forward flow.
   - cont. cooling protocol
   - maintain pressors
   - consider addition of ionotropic support (dopa?)
   .
   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- LP
   .
   #embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted on [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) with interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, after resuscitation.

The patient's current condition includes unresponsiveness/hemodynamic instability, respiratory status, metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, fevers of unknown origin, embolic stroke, hypothyroidism/adrenal nodules, CAD, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued hemodynamic instability: The patient is currently supported on levophed and fluids, and the lactate levels are persistently elevated. This suggests ongoing poor tissue perfusion and the need for careful monitoring and management of hemodynamics.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is hyperventilating, which could be a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory function is essential.

3. Infection/sepsis: Despite being off antibiotics, the patient still has fevers, and there are positive blood cultures from the femoral line. This indicates the possibility of ongoing infection and the need for appropriate antibiotic therapy.

4. Stroke sequelae: The patient has had embolic hemorrh"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted on [3-6] with fevers and hypotension. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fevers of unknown origin (FUO) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient became unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, requiring resuscitation. He was later found to have a persistent upgoing Babinski sign, urinary retention, and respiratory alkalosis. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing support from vasopressors and fluids. A cooling protocol has been initiated due to concerns about potential brain injury. Additional tests and interventions include arterial line placement, multi-lumen line placement, EKG monitoring, blood cultures, urine culture, trans-thoracic echo, and MRI of the head and cervical spine. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 104/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatine kinase (CK), troponin-T, and lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal scattered areas of low attenuation in the subcortical white matter, consistent with previous thromboembolic ischemic"

The patient has been undergoing an extensive workup for fevers of unknown origin (FUO) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He is currently unresponsive and in hemodynamic instability, requiring support from pressors and fluids. 

The patient had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and underwent resuscitation. The initial rhythm was PEA, and the patient received CPR, sodium bicarbonate, and epinephrine during the code. The cause of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but the patient had new weakness, upgoing Babinski sign, urinary retention, and respiratory alkalosis prior to the event. Lactate levels were elevated at 8.1 during the code.

The patient is currently being supported with levophed and fluids. He is on a cooling protocol after an electrocardiogram (EKG) and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. There is also a small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.

The patient has a history of CAD and is on aspirin and pravastatin. He also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III and hyper"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   #Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The first documented rhythm
   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  Had Femoral line with 1 postive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was started
   on [**3-25**]. Was cooled and then rewarmed.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated starting with neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   -f/u bld, urine cx
   -head imaging pending weaning of one pressor
   -c-spine MRI
   -consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate (presistently elevated to 5 and falling today to 2.2
   ..
   #Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   #Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.29/30/79.  likely due to cardiac
   disfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors
   and cooling
   - cont. cooling protocol
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   .
   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   - d/c acyclovir
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   #embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   -start insulin

He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, and underwent resuscitation.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) rhythm. He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and administration of sodium bicarbonate and epinephrine. The cause of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but the patient had symptoms such as new weakness, upgoing Babinski sign, urinary retention, and respiratory alkalosis. Lactate levels during the code were elevated at 8.1. The patient is currently being supported on levophed (norepinephrine) and fluids. Cooling protocol has been initiated, and further tests including an echocardiogram (Echo), electroencephalogram (EEG), and computed tomography (CT) scan of the head have been ordered. A femoral line with one positive blood culture (BCx) is present.
- Respiratory status: The patient is oxygenating well and improving respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). Ventilator weaning is planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated starting with neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   - f/u bld, urine cx
   - Brain and C-spine MRI today
   - consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).
- He was admitted on [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension.
- The patient underwent extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes.
- He became unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, resulting in a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [**3-25**].
- The patient was resuscitated and placed on a cooling protocol after an echocardiogram, electroencephalogram (EEG), and computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, which were all negative for acute bleed.
- He has a femoral line with one positive blood culture (BCx).
- The patient still requires pressor support but has been able to be weaned off of neo-synephrine overnight.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is oxygenating well, with an improving respiratory system compliance index (RSBI).
- The patient has metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and poor forward flow.
- He has hypoalbuminemia, which may contribute to intravascular volume and pressure problems.
- The patient has had an embolic stroke and is continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
- There are several other ongoing assessments and plans, including monitoring for fevers of unknown origin"

He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, but was successfully resuscitated.

The patient's current condition includes unresponsiveness and hemodynamic instability. He experienced a cardiac arrest with a documented rhythm of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and administration of NaHCO3 and epinephrine. The etiology of the event is unclear, but the patient had a prodrome of new weakness, upgoing Babinski sign, urinary retention, and respiratory alkalosis of unknown cause. Lactate levels during the code were elevated at 8.1. He is currently being supported on levophed (norepinephrine) and fluids.

The patient underwent cooling and rewarming, and various tests including an echocardiogram (Echo), electroencephalogram (EEG), and computed tomography (CT) scan of the head were performed. The patient has a femoral line with one positive blood culture (BCx).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, as indicated by the elevated white blood cell count (28.8 K/uL) and the presence of infection markers such as lactic acid (2.8 mmol/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP). 

The patient is also experiencing acute kidney injury, evident from the increased creatinine levels (1.8 - 2.0 mg/dL) and the decreased urine output (371 mL over 24 hours). Additionally, the patient has hyperglycemia with elevated blood glucose levels (126 - 297 mg/dL) and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (Na 131 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (K 2.0 mEq/L).

The patient's respiratory status is concerning with a low respiratory rate (RR 16-21 bpm) and inadequate oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 222). The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's cardiovascular status is unstable, as indicated by hypotension (BP 94/50 mmHg) and the need for vasop"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) admitted on 3-6 with fevers and hypotension. He was undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient became unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, requiring resuscitation. He had a femoral line with one positive blood culture (BCx) and was placed on a cooling protocol after an echo, EEG, and CT scan of the head (negative for acute bleed). The patient is still requiring pressor support but has been able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on 3-25, which required resuscitation. The etiology of the event is unclear, but the patient had symptoms of weakness, upgoing Babinski sign, urinary retention, and respiratory alkalosis of unknown cause before the arrest. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause of this event.

2. Respiratory status: The patient is oxygenating well and improving respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The plan is to continue weaning the patient off the ventilator.

3. Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: The patient initially had a high lactate level of 5.1, likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] undergoing extensive workup for FUO with
   interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found
   unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   #Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The first documented rhythm
   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  New RIJ was started but femoral TL was not pulled (1 positive
   blood culture from the femoral site
 GPC in clusters).
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   -continue on cooling protocol to complete 18-24 hr duration, then
   re-warm
   -f/u bld, urine cx
   -head imaging pending re-warming
   -c-spine MRI pending re-warming
   -consider LP when warmed
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate (presistently elevated to 5.1
 likely [**1-20**] to
   peripheral vasoconstriction).
   .
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of
   #Respiratory status: oxygenating well on current settings,
   hyperventilating as well.
   - on vent continue current settings
   .
   #Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.29/30/79.  likely due to cardiac
   disfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors
   and cooling
   - cont. cooling protocol
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   .
   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   - d/c acyclovir
   .
   #embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for further evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, unresponsiveness, and pulseless, resulting in cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated but remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, bacteremia, metabolic acidosis, fevers of unknown origin, embolic stroke, hypothyroidism, adrenal nodules, CAD, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (stage III), and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Hypotension: The patient is on multiple vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. There is a risk of organ ischemia and dysfunction if blood pressure is not adequately controlled.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture from the femoral line, indicating bacteremia. There is a risk of sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated lactate level, indicating poor tissue perfusion and metabolic acidosis. This can lead to multiorgan dysfunction if not corrected.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for further evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient developed multiple embolic hemorrhagic strokes, became unresponsive, and experienced cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple vasopressors. His neurological status is described as sedated and encephalopathic with occasional purposeful movements. The patient has a history of bacteremia attributed to line placement during resuscitation, metabolic acidosis likely due to cardiac dysfunction, and poor glycemic control. The patient's current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating an ongoing struggle with adequate oxygenation and ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require adjustments in ventilator settings or consideration for tracheostomy.

2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function appears compromised, as suggested by the presence of metabolic acidosis and the need for multiple vasopressors. This indicates potential issues with cardiac output and systemic perfusion. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and cardiac enzymes is essential.

3. Neurological Complications: Given the patient's neurological status, there is a risk of further neurological decline or new ischemic events. Monitoring brain function, performing regular neuroim"

   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated starting with neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event

   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated, now vasopressor
   - f/u bld, urine cx
   - Brain and C-spine MRI today

   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted on 3-6 with fevers and hypotension. He underwent extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient is currently unresponsive and has experienced pulseless arrest, which was successfully resuscitated.

The patient's current condition includes unresponsiveness/hemodynamic instability, respiratory alkalosis of unknown cause, urinary retention, weakness, and an upgoing Babinski sign. He has been placed on a cooling protocol following an echocardiogram, EEG, and CT scan of the head, which were negative for acute bleed. The patient still requires pressor support but has been weaned off neosynephrine.

The patient's medical history includes CAD, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism with adrenal nodules. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including vancomycin, zosyn, aspirin, pravastatin, and insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate: 67 bpm (Sinus Rhythm)
- Blood pressure: 93/48 mmHg (65/81 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for further evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, became unresponsive, and experienced cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated but remained intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient is currently on vasopressors, but the dosage has been tapered to 2 agents. 

The patient's neurological status is concerning with evidence of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), unclear etiology, and potential spinal cord involvement. An MRI of the spine is pending to assess for any spinal cord lesion. The patient has a history of bacteremia attributed to line placement during the code. 

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, renal failure (acute on chronic insufficiency), hypotension (partially attributed to sepsis), hyponatremia (total body water overloaded), and hyperglycemia (improved control, now off insulin infusion). 

The patient is enrolled in a research study receiving either steroid versus placebo. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 112/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's CVP is 5 mmHg, total input/output balance is within normal limits, and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] undergoing extensive workup for FUO with
   interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found
   unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asytole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in study (receiving either steroid vs placebo)
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis, but otherwise unclear.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology.  Continue
   evaluation as outlined.   Consider multiple embolic events, such as
   endocarditis.  Awaiting MRI of spine.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Notable for prior lactate of 5.1, now
   improving.  Would repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS, monitor Na.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control.  Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain
   glucose <150.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, admitted for further evaluation of fever of unknown origin. He developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, became unresponsive, pulseless, and was resuscitated. The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He experienced a cardiac arrest and is now on a cooling protocol. The patient has hypotension, neurological deficits consistent with multiple strokes, bacteremia attributed to line placement, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure on chronic insufficiency, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and fever of unknown origin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring as he is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Any changes in oxygenation or ventilation should be promptly addressed to prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Neurological Complications: Given the presence of multiple strokes, the patient is at risk for ongoing neurological deterioration. Monitoring for changes in mental status, motor function, and sensory perception is crucial. Additionally, considering the possibility of multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis, further evaluation is warranted.

3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored due to his history of CAD and recent cardiac arrest. Arrhythmias, heart failure, or other cardiac events should be promptly identified and managed.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be monitored"

   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx

   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted on 3/6 with fevers and hypotension. The patient underwent extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, and underwent resuscitation.

The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on 3/25, for which he received chest compressions, sodium bicarbonate, and epinephrine. He required pressor support but was able to be weaned off neosynephrine overnight. He has a femoral line with one positive blood culture (GPC), and a new radial line was placed on 3/25. The patient's platelet count has been declining stepwise from 201 on 3/25, which may be drug-related or due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is oxygenating well. His metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation is likely due to cardiac dysfunction and poor forward flow. The patient's fevers of unknown origin have trended down, and he is currently off antibiotics. 

The patient also has hypoalbuminemia, possibly due to renal disease and poor oral intake. He had an"

   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacle to extubation currently altered mental status.
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.  Awaiting final read of
   MRI of spine to assess for spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline.

   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control.  Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) admitted for workup of fever of unknown origin (FUO) and subsequent development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient was found unresponsive, pulseless, and in cardiac arrest. After resuscitation, the patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has also been experiencing hypotension, neurological issues including multiple CVAs, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and is on nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient has bacteremia, likely due to line placement during cardiac arrest. There is an ongoing risk of infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
3. Neurological Complications: The patient has had multiple embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and further neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or cerebral edema could occur.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to increased bleeding risks, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He was found unresponsive and pulseless, but successfully resuscitated. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. He has hypotension, neurological impairment, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and nutritional support needs.

The patient's current condition is critical, and he is in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and his blood glucose level is currently being controlled.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.8 thousand/mm³, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 147 thousand/mm³, elevated lactate level of 2.7 mmol/L, and renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further neurological deterioration, development of septic shock,"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands.
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued per ID
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin, famotidine
   - get DIC/TTP labs for now
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted on 3/6 with fevers and hypotension. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) with interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 

Assessment and plan:
1. Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on 3/25. He was successfully resuscitated after CPR and received chest compressions, sodium bicarbonate, and epinephrine. The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but there were signs of new weakness, upgoing Babinski reflex, urinary retention, and respiratory alkalosis. The patient is still requiring pressor support but has been weaned off neosynephrine. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 201 to 72. The cause could be drug-related (zosyn vs heparin vs vancomycin), or it could be disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Respiratory status"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted on [3-6] with fevers and hypotension. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient experienced unresponsiveness and hemodynamic instability, resulting in a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [3-25]. He was successfully resuscitated and underwent chest compressions, sodium bicarbonate, and epinephrine.

The patient's mental status has improved and he intermittently follows commands. He is still requiring pressor support but has been weaned off neosynephrine. An lumbar puncture (LP) was performed, and cultures are pending for various organisms including HSV, VZV, EBV, TB, and bacteria. The patient is also being evaluated for potential sources of emboli through a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 72, which is a stepwise decline from 201 on [3-25]. The possible causes include drug-related effects, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is oxygenating well with an improving respiratory"

   broad-based disc protrusion without evidence of cord signal
   abnormality. Additional multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical
   spine as described above.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions. Please correlate with chest
   radiographs.
   MRI HEAD IMPRESSION:
   1. Multiple new foci of restricted diffusion scattered throughout both
   cerebral hemispheres suggestive of a combination of watershed and
   embolic events.
   2. Cortical FLAIR hyperintensities in the biparietal cortices
   suggestive of an hypoxic event.
   3. Stable central and cortical involutional changes as expected for the
   patient's age of 74 years.
   4. Left sphenoid sinus and mastoid disease as described above, the
   activity of which is to be determined clinically.
   CXR: IMPRESSION: Worsening cardiogenic edema. ETT at thoracic inlet.
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified on [**2184-3-29**] at 10 a.m.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands.
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued per ID
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - insulin sliding scale

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.

   # Thrombocytopoenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.

","The patient is a 74-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted on [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) with interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient became unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, underwent resuscitation, and was intubated. 

The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [**3-25**] and was successfully resuscitated after approximately 20 minutes of chest compressions, sodium bicarbonate, and epinephrine administration. He had a femoral line with one positive blood culture (GPC) and a new right internal jugular (RIJ) line was placed on [**3-25**]. 

The patient continues to require pressor support but has been weaned off neosynephrine. A lumbar puncture (LP) was done, and he is on vancomycin and Zosyn. Vancomycin was discontinued due to coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia. 

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 72, showing a stepwise decline from 201 on [**3-25**]. The possible causes include drug-related thrombocytopenia (Zosyn vs heparin vs vancomycin),"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> improving; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Await repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline, continued.  Recent Bone Marrow
   without evidence for megakaroycyte defect.  Monitor Plts.  Consider
   HIT, ,medication effect, consumptive.  D/C heparin products and all
   non-essential medications that could be
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, admitted for workup of fever of unknown origin and subsequent development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He was found unresponsive, pulseless, and in cardiac arrest, successfully resuscitated, and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient remains mechanically ventilated, showing stable gas exchange with radiographic evidence of bilateral pleural effusions. He has been through a cooling protocol for possible therapeutic hypothermia following his cardiac arrest. The patient is enrolled in a research study receiving either steroid or placebo. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor SaO2.
2. Cardiac arrest - Continue current level of support, enrolled in research study.
3. Hypotension - Tolerating net weaning of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
4. Neurological - Evaluate for possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis, consider multiple embolic events.
5. Bacteremia - Continue antimicrobials, await repeat TEE.
6. Thrombocytopenia - Monitor Plts, consider HIT, medication effect, consumptive.
7. Anemia - Check peripheral blood smear.
8. Metabolic acidosis - Repeat lactate level.
9. Renal failure - Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
10. Hyponatremia - Check serum/ur"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> improving; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Await repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline, continued.  Recent Bone Marrow
   without evidence for megakaroycyte defect.  Monitor Plts.  Consider
   HIT, ,medication effect, consumptive.  D/C heparin products and all
   non-essential medications that could be
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for further evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient experienced an embolic hemorrhagic stroke, became unresponsive, pulseless, and asystolic during cardiac arrest, and required resuscitation. The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's neurological status is improving but remains altered, and there are concerns about multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis. The patient has hypotension, which is being managed with vasopressors, and there is evidence of bacteremia attributed to line placement. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hyponatremia, and hyperglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further complications related to ventilation and weaning off the ventilator.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is improving but remains altered. There are concerns about possible CNS processes like CNS vasculitis or multiple embolic events. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and prevent any potential neurological deterioration.
3. Infection: The patient has evidence of bacteremia and is being treated with antimicrobials. There is a risk of developing se"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-continued per
   ID
   - consider steroid replacement therapy
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis. DIC/TTP labs
   unconcerning.
   - trend
   - re-involve heme
   - PF4 ab pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine, consider re-d/c vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   - rationalize abx
 currently on vanc, zosyn , cultures pending
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershe stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted on [3-6] with fevers and hypotension. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) with interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [3-25], for which he was resuscitated. He required chest compressions, sodium bicarbonate, and epinephrine. Unclear etiology, the patient had a prodrome of new weakness, upgoing Babinski sign, urinary retention, and respiratory alkalosis of unknown cause. He was placed on a cooling protocol after an echocardiogram (Echo), electroencephalogram (EEG), and computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, which were negative for acute bleed. A femoral line was placed with one positive blood culture (BCx). A new radial arterial line (RIJ) was placed on [3-25]. The patient still requires pressor support but can be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The patient remains unresponsive with hemodynamic instability. PEA arrest occurred on [3-25], and the patient underwent resuscitation. He is currently improving"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted on 3/6 with fevers and hypotension. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on 3/25, during which he was resuscitated. He had a femoral line with one positive blood culture and was placed on a cooling protocol. He also had an electroencephalogram (EEG) and computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, which were negative for acute bleeding.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 117/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. His weight is currently 105.5 kg, with a height of 70 inches.

The patient is on multiple medications including famotidine, midazolam, fentanyl, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He has a central venous catheter (CVC) in the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and an arterial line in the left radial artery. He also has peripheral intravenous (IV) access.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands.
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued per ID
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin, famotidine
   - get DIC/TTP labs for now
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted on [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for fevers of unknown origin (FUO) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient became unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, resulting in a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [**3-25**]. After resuscitation, he showed improvement in mental status and intermittent follow-up commands.

The patient continues to require pressor support but has been weaned off of neosynephrine. He has a thrombocytopenia with platelets at 72, which is a stepwise decline from 201 on [**3-25**]. The possible causes include drug-related effects (zosyn vs heparin vs vancomycin), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). 

His respiratory status has improved, and he is oxygenating well. The plan is to continue weaning him off the ventilator and diurese as tolerated. The patient also has metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload. 

The patient's fevers have trended down, and he is currently off"

   Disposition:
","The patient's condition is critical, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has worsening thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding and clotting complications.

2. Heparin-dependent antibodies: The patient has been sent for heparin-dependent antibodies testing, indicating a possible reaction to heparin, a medication used to prevent blood clots. If present, this could lead to further bleeding complications.

3. TEE failure: The transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) procedure failed to pass the probe into the esophagus. This may have implications for assessing cardiac function and identifying any thrombi or other abnormalities in the heart.

4. Arterial line issues: The patient has an arterial line, which is used to monitor blood pressure and obtain arterial blood gas samples. Hemolysis/DIC labs have been negative, but there may still be risks associated with the arterial line, such as infection or ischemia.

5. Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a PSV/SBT mode, indicating pressure-controlled ventilation with spontaneous breaths. Adjustments may need to be made to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

6. Antibiotic usage: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. These medications can have side effects and interactions"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who was admitted for a workup of fever of unknown origin. He subsequently developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes and was found unresponsive, pulseless, and in cardiac arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated but remains critically ill with multiple organ dysfunctions.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This will need to be closely monitored and managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is partially attributable to sepsis. Tolerating net weaning of vasopressors should be monitored, and the blood pressure should be maintained at a minimum of 60 mmHg.

3. Neurological issues: The patient has evidence of multiple cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) with unclear etiology, possibly embolic in nature. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of these neurological issues.

4. Bacteremia: The patient is suspected to have bacteremia attributed to line placement during the code. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be continued.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a significant decline in platelet count, which is associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin products should be discontinued, and non-essential medications contributing to HIT should be stopped"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline, continued.  Recent Bone Marrow
   without evidence for megakaroycyte defect.  Monitor Plts.  Consider
   HIT, ,medication effect, consumptive.  D/C heparin products and all
   non-essential medications that could be
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-continued per
   ID for total 10 day course; today is day 9
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 42, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Likely HIT (given pos ab).
   - trend
   - re-involve heme; consider direct thrombin inhibitor
   - PF4 ab POSITIVE; serotonin release antibody drawn and pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine, consider re-d/c vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   - rationalize abx
 currently on vanc, zosyn , cultures pending
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershed stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   # Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   # CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   # AOCRF
 Now with uptrending creatinine.
   - IVF PRN
   - monitor lytes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted with fevers and hypotension. The patient underwent extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He became unresponsive and experienced pulseless arrest, which required resuscitation.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The patient had a pulseless arrest on [**3-25**] and required resuscitation. He is still requiring pressor support but has been weaned off of neosynephrine.
- Mental status: The patient's mental status has improved and he intermittently follows commands, although it is described as waxing and waning.
- Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, with a stepwise decline from 201 on [**3-25**]. This is likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- Respiratory status: The patient is oxygenating well and improving RSBI. He is planned to be weaned off the ventilator soon.
- Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and poor forward flow.
- Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, and further investigation with a gallium scan is planned when"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-continued per
   ID for total 10 day course; today is day 9
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 42, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis. DIC/TTP labs
   unconcerning.
   - trend
   - re-involve heme
   - PF4 ab POSITIVE; serotonin release antibody drawn and pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine, consider re-d/c vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   - rationalize abx
 currently on vanc, zosyn , cultures pending
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershed stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   # Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted on 3/6 with fevers and hypotension. He underwent an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient became unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, resulting in a prolonged cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) that required resuscitation.

Since admission, the patient has had various complications and conditions, including unresponsiveness/hemodynamic instability, thrombocytopenia, respiratory status, metabolic acidosis, fevers of unknown origin, hypoalbuminemia, embolic vs watershed stroke, hypothyroidism/adrenal nodules, CAD, hyperlipidemia, acute kidney injury (up-trending creatinine), hyperglycemia, and femoral line with one positive blood culture (GPC).

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam), pressor support (norepinephrine), fentanyl, and Zyprexa. He is also on aspirin, pravastatin, and statins for his CAD and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/53 to 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies, such as an echocardiogram, EEG, and CT scan of the head, have been performed, but are not mentioned in the note.

Plan:
The patient's plan includes weaning off pressor support, continuation of antibiotics, monitoring blood cultures, follow-up with neurology, performing additional tests like a TEE, and considering a gallium scan for fever of unknown origin. The patient also requires continued monitoring of his respiratory status, metabolic acidosis, and other ongoing concerns."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.

   medical condition, answered all questions.  All agree that patient
   would not chronic mechanical ventilation, and would not want to
   continue high level of support for prolonged period.  Currently patient
   has been breathing with minimal ventilator support, and and is
   otherwise medically ready for extubation but has remained intubated due
   to somnulant mental status.  All agree that patient has undergone
   extensive testing and interventions, and that clearly there has been
   overall clinical decline, includine significant neurological deficit
   (as indicated by head MRI).  All clearly state that patient would not
   want additional interventions if no promise for complete recovery.  All
   agree to proceed with extubation currently, despite somnulant mental
   status in hope that patient will be comfortable and may be able to
   protect airway.  If clinical status declines following extubation, no
   plans for reintubation or resussitation as previously discussed, with
   focus of care then on comfort.  Plan to proceed with extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, multiple embolic strokes, and unresponsive status post resuscitation. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has hypotension, neurological deficits, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia (HIT positive), anemia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He is critically ill and has undergone extensive testing and interventions without significant improvement. The patient's family has agreed to proceed with extubation, focusing on comfort care if the patient's clinical status declines. Potential medical complications include continued respiratory failure, sepsis, renal failure, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease admitted to the ICU for workup of fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient experienced multiple embolic hemorrhagic strokes and was found unresponsive with asystole and pulseless. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, and the patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient has been through a cardiac arrest, possibly experiencing pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and underwent a cooling protocol. He is now receiving supportive care and is enrolled in a research study.

The patient is hypotensive and has been tolerating weaning of vasopressors. His neurological status is altered with evidence of multiple CVAs of unclear etiology, possibly embolic in nature. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of these neurological issues.

The patient has bacteremia attributed to line placement during the code and is receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy. He has thrombocytopenia with a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) test, leading to the discontinuation of heparin products. Anemia is progressive, and metabolic acidosis has improved.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cardiac artery disease who was admitted for workup of fever of unknown origin (FUO). During the hospital stay, the patient developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes and was found unresponsive, pulseless, and in asystolic cardiac arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated and has been on mechanical ventilation since then. The patient is currently critically ill with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure in the context of cardiac arrest. The current ventilator settings are stable, and the patient is showing reasonable gas exchange. However, the main obstacles to extubation are altered mental status and fluid balance issues.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest with asystole as the initial rhythm, which may have been a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) event. The patient underwent a cooling protocol, which is now complete. The patient will continue with the current level of support.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed in part to sepsis. The patient is tolerating a gradual weaning of vasopressors, and blood pressure should be monitored to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient has evidence of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), with unclear etiology, possibly embolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-started zosyn

   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI. Extubated.
   - continue to monitor patient status
 give nebs and face mask as
   needed, no reintubation
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, admitted with fevers and hypotension. He underwent extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient became unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, requiring resuscitation. He was diagnosed with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which he was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been on a cooling protocol since then.

Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been declining stepwise from 201 on [**3-25**]th. It is likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin and vancomycin were discontinued, and the patient is being monitored for further decline in platelets. A positive PF4 antibody test confirms the diagnosis of HIT.

2. Respiratory status: The patient was initially intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He has now been extubated and is on face mask oxygenation. His respiratory status is improving, with good oxygenation and improving respiratory system compliance index (RSBI).

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient initially had metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation. The initial lactate level was 5.1, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and poor forward flow. The patient's condition has improved, and the acidosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for further evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). During his hospital stay, he developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes and subsequently became unresponsive after experiencing cardiac arrest. The patient underwent resuscitation and has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, neurological impairment, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and nutritional support. 

The assessment and plan include monitoring SaO2 while continuing mechanical ventilation, evaluating for possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis, continuing antimicrobials for bacteremia, monitoring Plts due to HIT, discontinuing heparin products and non-essential medications contributing to HIT, checking peripheral blood smear for anemia, maintaining intravascular repletion for renal failure, and monitoring UO, BUN, and creatinine. 

The patient is also being provided with nutritional support through tube feeding (TF) and NovaSource Renal (Full) at 40 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained with insulin infusion. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI and elevation of head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, admitted for further evaluation of fever of unknown origin. The patient experienced an embolic hemorrhagic stroke and was found unresponsive, pulseless, and asystolic, requiring resuscitation. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has shown stability on current settings but is still considered unstable due to altered mental status and fluid balance issues.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and experienced asystole as the initial rhythm, possibly experiencing pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient underwent a cooling protocol, which is now complete. The patient is currently on support and enrolled in a research study receiving either steroid or placebo.

The patient has hypotension, which is partly due to sepsis, and is tolerating weaning of vasopressors. Blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be closely monitored to maintain above 60 mmHg.

Neurologically, the patient has evidence of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) with an unclear etiology, possibly embolic in nature. There is concern for possible central nervous system (CNS) processes such as CNS vasculitis. The patient's mental status and exam show variability, suggesting possible seizures with post-ictal state. No neurological improvement has been observed.

The patient has bacteremia, likely due to line placement during the code."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted for a workup of fever of unknown origin. He developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes and was found unresponsive, pulseless, and asystolic. After resuscitation, he was intubated due to respiratory failure and remains on mechanical ventilation. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest with initial rhythm of asystole, possibly PEA. He underwent cooling protocol for therapeutic hypothermia. He is currently receiving vasopressor support for hypotension, likely due to sepsis. The neurological assessment shows evidence of multiple cerebral vascular accidents, unclear etiology, possibly embolic. There are concerns about possible CNS processes such as CNS vasculitis or seizures. The patient has bacteremia attributed to line placement during code, and thrombocytopenia related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). He also has anemia, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure on chronic insufficiency, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's overall condition is critical, and the family has agreed to transition to comfort care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The potential complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung infection due to prolonged intubation.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest with initial rhythm of asystole, which can lead to further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Neurological impairment: The patient has evidence of multiple cerebral vascular accidents, and there are concerns about possible CNS processes. This can result in neurological deficits, seizures, or cognitive impairment.
4. Infection: The patient has bacteremia and a fever of unknown origin, indicating a risk of systemic infection. Complications may include sepsis or septic shock.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure on chronic insufficiency. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications related to kidney dysfunction.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia due to HIT. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially with invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state if not managed properly.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or coma if severe.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to provide appropriate care for the patient."
