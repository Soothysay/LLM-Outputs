","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of dialysis catheter insertion. The patient has a history of allergies to colchicine, atorvastatin, and cinacalcet, with nausea and vomiting as a known side effect of cinacalcet. The patient received infusions of ranitidine and heparin sodium, and is on other ICU medications including nitro gtt, which was discontinued after dialysis. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.1°C to 37°C, heart rate between 74-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/78 mmHg to 217/134 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 88%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 99 mL and total output of 2,500 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,401 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 88%. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count at 189 K/uL, hemoglobin at 10.8 g/dL, potassium at 154 mg/dL, sodium at 2.9 mg/dL, chloride at 29 mEq/L, bicarbonate at 3.6 mEq/L, glucose at 15 mg/dL, and magnesium at 35.6 %. The patient's creatinine level is 2.9 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels are within normal range. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute diastolic heart failure, chronic renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of heart failure symptoms, further deterioration of renal function, and the risk of infections due to the presence of indwelling lines and catheters."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (T, T, Sa) who presented with acute onset shortness of breath. The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 30-40% and moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). She improved with positive pressure ventilation and a nitroglycerin infusion. The likely cause of her symptoms is fluid overload, and the etiology of heart failure is presumed to be hypertensive heart disease. However, the patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization, and her hypokinesis is global.

The patient also has eosinophilia, which has been present in the past without a clear explanation. She has had negative stool ova and parasites, normal cortisol levels, and there have been thoughts of possible sarcoidosis but not further evaluated. If the patient's symptoms do not improve with dialysis, a repeat CT scan of the chest will be obtained and consideration will be given to treating sarcoidosis.

The patient has multiple other medical conditions including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and sleep apnea. She is currently on various medications including irbesartan, carvedilol, simvastatin, NPH insulin in the morning, and ISS at home doses for diabetes management. She is also taking ASA 81"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (T, T, Sa) presenting with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB). The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 30-40 and also has moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). She improved with positive pressure and a nitroglycerin (nitro gtt). The patient is very hypertensive, and the likely cause of her heart failure is fluid overload. The etiology of heart failure is presumed to be hypertensive heart disease. However, the patient has never had a cardiac catheterization, and her hypokinesis is global.

The patient requires urgent dialysis, as renal has been consulted. It is recommended to continue the nitro gtt. Further investigations include final chest X-ray, cardiac enzymes, and repeating EKG as the emergency room EKG was not transferred to the ICU.

The patient also has eosinophilia, which has been present in the past without clear explanation. Negative stool O&P and normal cortisol levels in the past suggest the possibility of sarcoidosis. However, this has not been further evaluated. If the patient's SOB does not improve with dialysis, a repeat CT scan of the chest will be considered, and treatment for sarcoidosis may be initiated.

Other medical conditions include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia"

   # SOB/Hypoxia: The patient had acute onset shortness of breath. EF is
   30-40 and also has moderate LVH She improved with positive pressure and
   a nitro gtt.  She is very hypertensive and the likely cause is fluid
   overload.  Etiology of heart failure is presumed to be hypertensive
   heart disease however the patient has never had a cardiac cath, and her
   hypokinesis is global.
   -she will require ugent dialysis, renal has been consulted.
   -continue nitro gtt
   -f/u final CXR read
   -add on cardiac enzymes, and repeat at 3 p.m. and 11 p.m.

   Has had negative stool O&P, in addition has had a normal cortisol in
   the past and there has been a thought of possible sarcoid but this has
   not been further evaluated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays), presenting with acute onset shortness of breath. She is currently being treated in the ICU for heart failure (diastolic), acute renal failure, and chronic renal failure. The patient's symptoms have improved with hemodialysis, and efforts are being made to obtain her dry weight. Her blood pressure is now normal to stage I hypertension. The patient's eosinophilia is trending, and stool O&P will be sent for analysis. Due to her history of sarcoidosis, there is a possibility of a flare, but she does not exhibit any symptoms related to that. Her current medications include irbesartan and carvedilol for hypertension, simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia, NPH in the morning and ISS at home doses for diabetes mellitus, aspirin 81mg daily and clopidogrel 75mg daily for history of cerebrovascular accident, CPAP at night for sleep apnea, and a bowel regimen at home. The patient is also receiving IV fluids as needed, replete with electrolytes, and is currently NPO due to recent BiPAP use at home. She is on prophylactic heparin subcutaneously and home H2 blocker. The patient's lines include a dialysis catheter placed on April 22nd,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (T,T,Sa), presenting with acute onset shortness of breath. She has a baseline ejection fraction (EF) of 30-40% and moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Her symptoms improved with positive pressure ventilation and nitroglycerin administration. The likely cause of her heart failure is fluid overload. She requires urgent dialysis, and renal has been consulted. She will continue nitroglycerin therapy, and further cardiac enzymes will be obtained. A follow-up chest X-ray is also planned. The patient has a history of eosinophilia, which has been present in the past without clear explanation. A repeat CT scan of the chest may be considered if her symptoms do not improve with dialysis, especially since there has been a thought of possible sarcoidosis. The patient's current medications include irbesartan and carvedilol for hypertension, simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia, NPH qam and ISS at home doses for diabetes mellitus, ASA 81mg daily and Plavix 75mg daily for a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and CPAP at night for sleep apnea.

She has chronic kidney disease and is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 155/58 mmHg, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is receiving fluids intravenously and has a urinary catheter in place for fluid balance monitoring.

Physical examination reveals no abnormal findings in the general appearance, heart, abdomen, extremities, or neurologic examination. However, the patient has poor respiratory effort with bilateral rales, indicating possible fluid accumulation in the lungs. Laboratory results show elevated serum creatinine and potassium levels, consistent with renal dysfunction. There is also eosinophilia present, which could be due to allergic reaction or other causes.

The patient's medical history includes a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), for which she is taking aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as sleep apnea, for which she is using CPAP at night. She also has a history of chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis three times a week.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (T,T,Sa), presenting with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB). The patient's SOB has improved with hemodialysis, and there are efforts to obtain dry weight. Blood pressure is now normal to stage I hypertension. The patient also has eosinophilia, which is being monitored, and stool O&P has been sent for analysis. There are no symptoms suggesting a flare of sarcoidosis, and SOB seems clearly related to volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) due to volume overload.
2. Chronic renal failure (CRF) with worsening renal function indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
3. Hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus, as evidenced by high glucose levels.
4. Hypertension requiring management with antihypertensive medications.
5. Potential infection or flare of sarcoidosis given eosinophilia and pending stool O&P results.
6. Risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobility and need for prophylactic anticoagulation.
7. Risk of stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to intensive care unit (ICU) stay.
8. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to mechanical ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (T, T, Sa) who presents with acute onset shortness of breath. The patient's symptoms have improved with hemodialysis, and attempts are being made to determine her dry weight. Her blood pressure is now normal to stage I hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and the improvement with hemodialysis suggest acute diastolic heart failure. This condition occurs when the heart's ability to relax and fill with blood is impaired, leading to fluid accumulation and congestion in the lungs.

2. Renal Failure, Chronic (CRF, Chronic Kidney Disease): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis. Chronic kidney disease can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 5.4 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

4. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level is low at 1.7 mg/dL. Hypomagnesemia can lead to muscle cramps, irregular heartbeat, and low blood pressure.

5. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophil count is elevated"
