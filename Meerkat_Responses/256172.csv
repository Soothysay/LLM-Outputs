   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o lung CA s/p resection and no adjuvant
   chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs lung ca
   recurrence with possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired
   pneumonia.
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
   - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo.
    -- change to azithro to doxycycline pending atypical w/u, ehrlichia
   smear
    -- add fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- bronch for BAL, cytology and cultures
    -- f/u ID recs
   - For neoplastic processes
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- f/u heme onc recs
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. f/u CTS for biopsy
   - IV decadron [**Hospital1 7**] today and then start prednisone 10 mg in AM
   (treatment of Sweets)
   # Hypotension: warm, likely distributive, no clear e/o shock at this
   point
   - IVF for support, alternate LR with saline given hyperchloremia.
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - if no head MRI at OSH, will need MRI head here today
   # Pneumonia, Atypical vs. Hospital Acquired, hypoxia, increased AA
   gradient. basilar infiltrates suspicious for superimposed infectious
   process, though certainly this could be neoplastic. Also ? aspiration/
   mucous plugging today
   - BAL today
   - continue vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - obtain MRI from OSH for reads here at [**Hospital1 19**]
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding.
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] fibrinogen
   - consider vitamin K
   # History of Lung Cancer: Unknown type, will seek additional records.
   Lymph node supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue
   diagnosis is needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with
   subcarinal node first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing
   # Leukocytosis: still elevated today
   - f/u cultures
   - c. difficile today
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease.
   - guiaic all stools
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - continuing to taper steroids, with caveat that if pt clinically
   worsens we may need to actually increase steroids. Unclear what is
   being treated at this juncture.
   # FEN
   - NPO for now.
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of lung cancer who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes heme malignancy, lung cancer recurrence, and superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia. Other possible considerations include lymphoma/myelodysplasia, adenocarcinoma of the lung or pancreas, squamous cell carcinoma, reactive lymphadenopathy, eosinophilic pneumonia, or fungal pneumonia.

The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents. A bone marrow biopsy is pending to evaluate for heme malignancy. Tissue diagnosis is needed if the bone marrow biopsy is unrevealing. A subcarinal lymph node biopsy is planned initially, followed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) if necessary. Decadron has been started for treatment of Sweet syndrome.

The patient also has hypotension, likely distributive, and altered mental status, possibly due to delirium or encephalitis. Carcinoma meningitis is a consideration, and cisternal CSF sampling may be performed if no head MRI is available. The patient's coagulopathy is concerning for consumptive coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Vitamin K and fibrinogen have been ordered.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o lung CA s/p resection and no adjuvant
   chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs lung ca
   recurrence with possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired
   pneumonia.
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo.
    -- change to azithro to doxycycline pending atypical w/u, ehrlichia
   smear
    -- add fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- considering bronchoscopy for BAL, cytology though likely would need
   to electively intubate
   - For neoplastic processes
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. Will d/w IP
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence.
   This is doubtfult to be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis
   seen on OSH is likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
   As such, will taper steroids to dexamethasone 1mg IV q8h.
   # Hypotension
   - warm, likely distributive, no clear e/o shock at this point
   - IVF for support, alternate LR with saline given hyperchloremia.
   # Altered Mental Status
   - likely delirium, though cannot r/o encephalitis. viral encephalitis
   serologies are pending
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling, and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.
     presently on hold.
   - Hypercalcemia likely is a contributing factor.
   # Pneumonia, Atypical vs. Hosptital Acquired
   - hypoxia, increased AA gradient.
   - basilar infiltrates suspicious for superimposed infectious process,
   though certainly this could be neoplastic
   - sputum culture, bronch possible though high O2 requirement and
   uncooperative. Would need elective intubation, deferred for now while
   we are gathering additional data.
   - try to collect sputum cytology.
   # Back Pain
   - likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c summary showed no
   mass/abscess. We are obtaining actual films on a disk and should arrive
   by tomorrow via family.
   # Coagulopathy;
   Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC given rising
   INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new finding. Will
   continue supportive care for now.
   # History of Lung Cancer
   Unknown type, will seek additional records. Lymph node supicious for
   recurrence or a second malignancy.
   - Tissue diagnosis is needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start
   with subcarinal node first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing
   # Leukocytosis
   - f/u cultures
   - Will send peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   # Anemia
   - Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   - Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a consumptive
   coagulopathy.
   - HIT merits consideration given hospitalization, though coincidence
   with rising INR and marrow process suggest a more plausible alternate
   explanation. Her pre-test probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3
   being low will not send PF4 test at this time, nor start
   anticoagulation.
   # Hypercalcemia
   - rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids
   - PTH is not suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses
   - likely secondary to a second process
   - continuing to taper steroids, with caveat that if pt clinically
   worsens we may need to actually increase steroids. Unclear what is
   being treated at this juncture.
   # FEN
   - NPO for now.
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.
   # Access: 2 PIV, PICC request in, may need 3L-CVL if intubated later
   for access.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of lung cancer who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The assessment suggests a possible heme malignancy versus lung cancer recurrence with a superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms, increased sputum production, and changes in oxygenation is important.
2. Consumptive coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and schistocytes on blood smear, indicating a possible consumptive coagulopathy like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Monitoring for signs of bleeding or thrombosis is crucial.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia likely due to primary hyperparathyroidism. Monitoring for signs of dehydration, renal dysfunction, and cardiac arrhythmias is necessary.
4. Sweet syndrome/neutrophilic dermatoses: The patient has evidence of Sweet syndrome. Monitoring for skin lesions and systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise is important.
5. Hyperthermia: The patient has had high fevers. Monitoring body temperature and providing appropriate interventions to manage fever is essential.
6. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive"
100292.0,256172,2122-09-20 07:56:00,Physician ,Physician Attending Progress Note,"Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    66 year old man with PMHx lung cancer 6 yrs ago, s/p RUL lobectomy (no
   chemo or XRT), as well as spondolithiasis s/p two laminectomies.  He
   initially presented to [**Hospital 755**] Hospital in mid-[**Month (only) 539**].  He lives in
   [**State 5568**], although he and his wife have been in the process of moving
   back to [**Location (un) 23**].  About two weeks after returning from [**State 5568**] he began
   to have lower back pain, first on the right and then on the left as
   well.  He then developed fevers and a cough.  He was also
   intermittently confused.  CT/MRI of the head and spine notable only for
   a intervertebral disc protrusion.  He also developed a progressive
   leukocytosis, but all cultures have remained negative.  He developed a
   facial rash while at [**Location (un) 755**], with a biopsy consistent with Sweet
   syndrome.  This resolved with steroids.  A bone marrow biopsy
   reportedly showed myelodysplasia bot no frank malignancy.  He was
   briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, but these
   were then discontinued in light of the lack of evidence of infection.
   He also had some angioedema of the tongue while there, which resolved.
   Multiple attempts at LP were made, but were unsuccessful.  He was
   treated empirically with steroids, with no benefit.  He was also found
   to be hyperfcalcemic, and was treated with pamidronate.  He was
   eventually transferred here on [**9-16**] for further evaluation.
         Since being transferred here he has been evaluated by neurology,
   infectious disease, heme-onc and rheumatology.  Bone marrow biopsy has
   been repeated and is pending.  LP was done, but appears to have been a
   very bloody tap, so has not been very helpful diagnostically.  He has
   continued to be febrile daily as high as 103, and has had waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.  Other notable findings have been a very high
   ferritin, declining platelets, declining HCT, and continued
   leukocytosis, although this is trending down as well.  Over the past
   1-2 days he has had some worsening shortness of breath, and CT of the
   chest shows some peripheral infiltrates and significant
   lymphadenopathy, including a 4cm subcarinal node.  He was transferred
   to the MICU this afternoon due to increased work of breathing and
   worsening hypoxemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old man with fevers, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
   hypercalcemia, rash consistent with Sweet
s syndrome, and now nodular
   peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as a pancreatic lesion seen on CT.  He is
   transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia.
   NEURO:  Mental status waxes and wanes, and extensive imaging of the CNS
   all negative.  Unclear if LP was a valid sample.  Currently appears to
   be a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Plan is for intubation due to
   worsening mental status, so he will require sedation with fentayl and
   versed.
   PULMONARY:   Worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.  Has
   received significant volume for hypotension, so there may be some
   pulmonary edema now in addition to the underlying pulmonary process.
   The cause for the infiltrates seen on CT is unclear.  Infection seems
   unlikely in light of his lack of inprovement on antibiotics (which were
   restarted here) and the so far negative work up. The nodular appearance
   and the impressive lymphadenopathy in conjunction with his labs suggest
   some hematologic or inflammatory cause.  We will intubate him today due
   to increased work of breathing and intermittent desaturations on high
   amounts of oxygen.  Once intubated, it will be easier to proceed with
   biopsy of his large subcarinal node if this is needed for diagnosis (if
   the BM biopsy is not revealing).
   CV: Hypotension, unclear etiology.  Suspect SIRS picture, although
   whether or not there is infection present is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 10653**] as
   needed to maintain BP, and will start pressors if needed.
   ID: All cultures to date are negative, sputum culture pending.  Being
   covered broadly with vanco, pip-tazo, and doxycycline.  ID following
   with us.  When bronch done for nodal biopsy will plan to send BAL as
   well.  Parasite smear sent today negative.
   RHEUM:  The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, very high ferritin and ESR,
   and sweet
s syndrome are all suggestive of some sort of rheumatologic
   process,  Still
s disease can cause may of these findings, but would
   not explain his pulmonary findings or the now-developing hypotension
   and respiratory failure.   The fact that he failed to improved after
   several days of decadron does go against  most rheumatologic causes,
   but biopsy of a lymph node will be helpful in ruling this out.
   HEME: All cell lines curently trending down, although WBC still very
   high.  Suspect the current down trend in all lines could reflect
   developing DIC.  Schistocytes seen on the last peripheral smear,
   although fibrinogen was elvevated when checked earlier today.  Will
   continue to trend haptoglobin and fibrinogen.  Repeat bone marrow
   biopsy pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of lung cancer and spondylolithiasis. He initially presented with lower back pain, fevers, a cough, and confusion. He was treated for Sweet syndrome and myelodysplasia. He developed a facial rash, angioedema of the tongue, and hypercalcemia. Imaging showed intervertebral disc protrusion and a pancreatic lesion. He was briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir but was eventually transferred to the MICU due to increased work of breathing and worsening hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis could indicate an ongoing or developing infection. However, all cultures have remained negative so far.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, for which he has been intubated.
3. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status fluctuations and negative extensive imaging of the CNS raise the possibility of a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient received significant volume for hypotension, which may have contributed to pulmonary edema in addition to the underlying pulmonary process.
5. Hematologic or inflammatory cause: The nodular appearance of the pulmonary infiltrates, impressive lymphadenopathy, and lab abnormalities suggest a hematologic or inflammatory"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    66 year old man with PMHx lung cancer 6 yrs ago, s/p RUL lobectomy (no
   chemo or XRT), as well as spondolithiasis s/p two laminectomies.  He
   initially presented to [**Hospital 755**] Hospital in mid-[**Month (only) 539**].  He lives in
   [**State 5568**], although he and his wife have been in the process of moving
   back to [**Location (un) 23**].  About two weeks after returning from [**State 5568**] he began
   to have lower back pain, first on the right and then on the left as
   well.  He then developed fevers and a cough.  He was also
   intermittently confused.  CT/MRI of the head and spine notable only for
   a intervertebral disc protrusion.  He also developed a progressive
   leukocytosis, but all cultures have remained negative.  He developed a
   facial rash while at [**Location (un) 755**], with a biopsy consistent with Sweet
   syndrome.  This resolved with steroids.  A bone marrow biopsy
   reportedly showed myelodysplasia bot no frank malignancy.  He was
   briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, but these
   were then discontinued in light of the lack of evidence of infection.
   He also had some angioedema of the tongue while there, which resolved.
   Multiple attempts at LP were made, but were unsuccessful.  He was
   treated empirically with steroids, with no benefit.  He was also found
   to be hyperfcalcemic, and was treated with pamidronate.  He was
   eventually transferred here on [**9-16**] for further evaluation.
         Since being transferred here he has been evaluated by neurology,
   infectious disease, heme-onc and rheumatology.  Bone marrow biopsy has
   been repeated and is pending.  LP was done, but appears to have been a
   very bloody tap, so has not been very helpful diagnostically.  He has
   continued to be febrile daily as high as 103, and has had waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.  Other notable findings have been a very high
   ferritin, declining platelets, declining HCT, and continued
   leukocytosis, although this is trending down as well.  Over the past
   1-2 days he has had some worsening shortness of breath, and CT of the
   chest shows some peripheral infiltrates and significant
   lymphadenopathy, including a 4cm subcarinal node.  He was transferred
   to the MICU this afternoon due to increased work of breathing and
   worsening hypoxemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old man with fevers, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
   hypercalcemia, rash consistent with Sweet
s syndrome, and now nodular
   peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as a pancreatic lesion seen on CT.  He is
   transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia.
   NEURO:  Mental status waxes and wanes, and extensive imaging of the CNS
   all negative.  Unclear if LP was a valid sample.  Currently appears to
   be a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Now intubated, sedated.  Will
   receive imaging from OSH today and will review it with radiology here.
   Neuro had recommended cisternal tap to eval CSF, but holding off for
   now.
   PULMONARY:   Worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.  The
   cause for the infiltrates seen on CT is unclear.  Infection seems
   unlikely in light of his lack of inprovement on antibiotics (which were
   restarted here) and the so far negative work up. The nodular appearance
   and the impressive lymphadenopathy in conjunction with his labs suggest
   some hematologic or inflammatory cause.  Intubated yesterday.
   Increased PEEP this AM, and blood gas improving.  Weaning FiO2.   Will
   plan for bronch/BAL today.  Also consulted thoracics for possible
   mediastinoscopy for node biopsy
   CV: Hypotension, unclear etiology.  Suspect SIRS picture, although
   whether or not there is infection present is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 10653**] as
   needed to maintain BP, and will start pressors if needed.  Central line
   placed for more access, and BP currently stable with fluids.
   ID: All cultures to date are negative, sputum culture pending.  Being
   covered broadly with vanco, pip-tazo, and doxycycline.  ID following
   with us.  Bronch/Bal planned for today.  Parasite smear sent today
   negative. Continue empiric antibiotics
   RHEUM:  The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, very high ferritin and ESR,
   and sweet
s syndrome are all suggestive of some sort of rheumatologic
   process,  Still
s disease can cause may of these findings, but would
   not explain his pulmonary findings or the now-developing hypotension
   and respiratory failure.   The fact that he failed to improved after
   several days of decadron does go against  most rheumatologic causes,
   but biopsy of a lymph node will be helpful in ruling this out.
   Currently eaning decadron to off.  If he worsens clinically, we may
   need to increase steroids again to see if this has any effect.
   HEME: Suspect neoplastic process and now developing DIC.  Schistocytes
   seen on the last peripheral smear, although fibrinogen was elvevated
   when checked earlier today.  Will continue to trend haptoglobin and
   fibrinogen.  Repeat bone marrow biopsy pending.  Transfused pRBC
   overnight.  Platelets stable, WBC stable in the mid 20
s.  FFP given
   today for central line placement.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. However, cultures have remained negative so far. The presence of peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy also raises concern for an infectious etiology.

2. Rheumatologic process: The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, very high ferritin, and ESR, along with the Sweet syndrome, suggest a possible rheumatologic process. However, this does not explain the pulmonary findings or the developing hypotension and respiratory failure.

3. Neoplastic process: The patient's history of lung cancer, along with the development of a pancreatic lesion seen on CT, raises suspicion for a neoplastic process. This could potentially explain the systemic symptoms and organ involvement.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The presence of schistocytes on the peripheral smear and elevated D-dimer levels indicate a possible coagulopathy. DIC can occur secondary to malignancy or sepsis, among other causes.

5. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes and waxing and waning consciousness may be attributed to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

6. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The worsening"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. Fever, hypotension, and pneumonia have been observed. The patient's vital signs indicate a high heart rate, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and elevated body temperature. The patient's blood culture was obtained through an arterial line and peripheral site. Several antibiotics have been administered, including piperacillin-tazobactam, doxycycline, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and lactate level. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. Imaging studies are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress, along with the presence of infiltrates on imaging studies, indicate the possibility of pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory complications if left untreated.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and fluctuating levels of consciousness may indicate delirium, which can increase the risk of falls"

   HPI:
    66 year old man with PMHx lung cancer 6 yrs ago, s/p RUL lobectomy (no
   chemo or XRT), as well as spondolithiasis s/p two laminectomies.  He
   initially presented to [**Hospital 755**] Hospital in mid-[**Month (only) 539**].  He lives in
   [**State 5568**], although he and his wife have been in the process of moving
   back to [**Location (un) 23**].  About two weeks after returning from [**State 5568**] he began
   to have lower back pain, first on the right and then on the left as
   well.  He then developed fevers and a cough.  He was also
   intermittently confused.  CT/MRI of the head and spine notable only for
   a intervertebral disc protrusion.  He also developed a progressive
   leukocytosis, but all cultures have remained negative.  He developed a
   facial rash while at [**Location (un) 755**], with a biopsy consistent with Sweet
   syndrome.  This resolved with steroids.  A bone marrow biopsy
   reportedly showed myelodysplasia bot no frank malignancy.  He was
   briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, but these
   were then discontinued in light of the lack of evidence of infection.
   He also had some angioedema of the tongue while there, which resolved.
   Multiple attempts at LP were made, but were unsuccessful.  He was
   treated empirically with steroids, with no benefit.  He was also found
   to be hyperfcalcemic, and was treated with pamidronate.  He was
   eventually transferred here on [**9-16**] for further evaluation.
         Since being transferred here he has been evaluated by neurology,
   infectious disease, heme-onc and rheumatology.  Bone marrow biopsy has
   been repeated and is pending.  LP was done, but appears to have been a
   very bloody tap, so has not been very helpful diagnostically.  He has
   continued to be febrile daily as high as 103, and has had waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.  Other notable findings have been a very high
   ferritin, declining platelets, declining HCT, and continued
   leukocytosis, although this is trending down as well.  Over the past
   1-2 days he has had some worsening shortness of breath, and CT of the
   chest shows some peripheral infiltrates and significant
   lymphadenopathy, including a 4cm subcarinal node.  He was transferred
   to the MICU this afternoon due to increased work of breathing and
   worsening hypoxemia.

   well.  He then developed fevers and a cough.  He was also
   intermittently confused.  CT/MRI of the head and spine notable only for
   a intervertebral disc protrusion.  He also developed a progressive
   leukocytosis, but all cultures have remained negative.  He developed a
   facial rash while at [**Location (un) 755**], with a biopsy consistent with Sweet
   syndrome.  This resolved with steroids.  A bone marrow biopsy
   reportedly showed myelodysplasia bot no frank malignancy.  He was
   briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, but these
   were then discontinued in light of the lack of evidence of infection.
   He also had some angioedema of the tongue while there, which resolved.
   Multiple attempts at LP were made, but were unsuccessful.  He was
   treated empirically with steroids, with no benefit.  He was also found
   to be hyperfcalcemic, and was treated with pamidronate.  He was
   eventually transferred here on [**9-16**] for further evaluation.
         Since being transferred here he has been evaluated by neurology,
   infectious disease, heme-onc and rheumatology.  Bone marrow biopsy has
   been repeated and is pending.  LP was done, but appears to have been a
   very bloody tap, so has not been very helpful diagnostically.  He has
   continued to be febrile daily as high as 103, and has had waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.  Other notable findings have been a very high
   ferritin, declining platelets, declining HCT, and continued
   leukocytosis, although this is trending down as well.  Over the past
   1-2 days he has had some worsening shortness of breath, and CT of the
   chest shows some peripheral infiltrates and significant
   lymphadenopathy, including a 4cm subcarinal node.  He was transferred
   to the MICU this afternoon due to increased work of breathing and
   worsening hypoxemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old man with fevers, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
   hypercalcemia, rash consistent with Sweet
s syndrome, and now nodular
   peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as a pancreatic lesion seen on CT.  He is
   transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia.
   NEURO:  Mental status waxes and wanes, and extensive imaging of the CNS
   all negative.  Unclear if LP was a valid sample.  Currently appears to
   be a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Now intubated, sedated.  Will
   receive imaging from OSH today and will review it with radiology here.
   Neuro had recommended cisternal tap to eval CSF, but holding off for
   now.
   PULMONARY:   Worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.  The
   cause for the infiltrates seen on CT is unclear.  Infection seems
   unlikely in light of his lack of inprovement on antibiotics (which were
   restarted here) and the so far negative work up. The nodular appearance
   and the impressive lymphadenopathy in conjunction with his labs suggest
   some hematologic or inflammatory cause.  Intubated yesterday.
   Increased PEEP this AM, and blood gas improving.  Weaning FiO2.   Will
   plan for bronch/BAL today.  Also consulted thoracics for possible
   mediastinoscopy for node biopsy
   CV: Hypotension, unclear etiology.  Suspect SIRS picture, although
   whether or not there is infection present is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 10653**] as
   needed to maintain BP, and will start pressors if needed.  Central line
   placed for more access, and BP currently stable with fluids.
   ID: All cultures to date are negative, sputum culture pending.  Being
   covered broadly with vanco, pip-tazo, and doxycycline.  ID following
   with us.  Bronch/Bal planned for today.  Parasite smear sent today
   negative. Continue empiric antibiotics
   RHEUM:  The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, very high ferritin and ESR,
   and sweet
s syndrome are all suggestive of some sort of rheumatologic
   process,  Still
s disease can cause may of these findings, but would
   not explain his pulmonary findings or the now-developing hypotension
   and respiratory failure.   The fact that he failed to improved after
   several days of decadron does go against  most rheumatologic causes,
   but biopsy of a lymph node will be helpful in ruling this out.
   Currently eaning decadron to off.  If he worsens clinically, we may
   need to increase steroids again to see if this has any effect.
   HEME: Suspect neoplastic process and now developing DIC.  Schistocytes
   seen on the last peripheral smear, although fibrinogen was elvevated
   when checked earlier today.  Will continue to trend haptoglobin and
   fibrinogen.  Repeat bone marrow biopsy pending.  Transfused pRBC
   overnight.  Platelets stable, WBC stable in the mid 20
s.  FFP given
   today for central line placement.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now.  After bronchoscopy will initiate tube feeds

   On this day I examined the patient and reviewed his hospital course to
   date and labs and imaging. I was present for the key portions of the
   services provided. I have also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and agree
   with her findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 10650**] presents a challenging
   case of a man with high fevers, leukocytosis, resp failure from
   bilateral nodular opacities, large mediastinal adenopathy, and abnl
   mentation, all  with a past hx of resected lung cancer.  The diff dx is
   broad, including infectious and non infectious (eg, sarcoid, COP/BOOP,
   etc) inflammatory conditions and neoplasm, including hematologic.  On
   exam it sounds like he may also have a pericardial friction rub and I
   would consider cardiac echo.  This afternoon he
s more hypoxic and
   rhonchorous likely due to earlier BAL with retained fluid. If BAL is
   not diagnostic I would move quickly to definitive lung bx or
   mediastinoscopy.  Meanwhile the pt remains broadly covered with
   antibiotics as we await BMbx and BAL results.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing due to bilateral nodular opacities and large mediastinal adenopathy. This indicates a possible respiratory failure which requires immediate attention.

2. Infection: The patient presents with high fevers, leukocytosis, and positive cultures. Although all cultures have remained negative so far, the possibility of an underlying infection should not be ruled out, especially considering the presence of pulmonary infiltrates.

3. Sweet Syndrome: The patient developed a facial rash consistent with Sweet syndrome, which is an inflammatory condition characterized by fever, rash, and leukocytosis. This may contribute to the overall systemic inflammatory response.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a declining platelet count, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can be a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or another underlying condition.

5. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is unclear in etiology. It may be related to sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or other causes. Appropriate measures should be taken to maintain blood pressure and prevent shock.

6. Nodular Pulmonary Infiltrates: The presence of nodular pulmonary infiltrates along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy raises concerns for"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old man with fevers, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
   hypercalcemia, rash consistent with Sweet
s syndrome, and now nodular
   peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as a pancreatic lesion seen on CT.  He is
   transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia.
   NEURO:  Mental status waxes and wanes, and extensive imaging of the CNS
   all negative.  Unclear if LP was a valid sample.  Currently appears to
   be a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Plan is for intubation due to
   worsening mental status, so he will require sedation with fentayl and
   versed.
   PULMONARY:   Worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.  Has
   received significant volume for hypotension, so there may be some
   pulmonary edema now in addition to the underlying pulmonary process.
   The cause for the infiltrates seen on CT is unclear.  Infection seems
   unlikely in light of his lack of inprovement on antibiotics (which were
   restarted here) and the so far negative work up. The nodular appearance
   and the impressive lymphadenopathy in conjunction with his labs suggest
   some hematologic or inflammatory cause.  We will intubate him today due
   to increased work of breathing and intermittent desaturations on high
   amounts of oxygen.  Once intubated, it will be easier to proceed with
   biopsy of his large subcarinal node if this is needed for diagnosis (if
   the BM biopsy is not revealing).
   CV: Hypotension, unclear etiology.  Suspect SIRS picture, although
   whether or not there is infection present is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 10653**] as
   needed to maintain BP, and will start pressors if needed.
   ID: All cultures to date are negative, sputum culture pending.  Being
   covered broadly with vanco, pip-tazo, and doxycycline.  ID following
   with us.  When bronch done for nodal biopsy will plan to send BAL as
   well.  Parasite smear sent today negative.
   RHEUM:  The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, very high ferritin and ESR,
   and sweet
s syndrome are all suggestive of some sort of rheumatologic
   process,  Still
s disease can cause may of these findings, but would
   not explain his pulmonary findings or the now-developing hypotension
   and respiratory failure.   The fact that he failed to improved after
   several days of decadron does go against  most rheumatologic causes,
   but biopsy of a lymph node will be helpful in ruling this out.
   HEME: All cell lines curently trending down, although WBC still very
   high.  Suspect the current down trend in all lines could reflect
   developing DIC.  Schistocytes seen on the last peripheral smear,
   although fibrinogen was elvevated when checked earlier today.  Will
   continue to trend haptoglobin and fibrinogen.  Repeat bone marrow
   biopsy pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of lung cancer, spondylolithiasis, and two laminectomies. He presented with lower back pain, fevers, cough, confusion, leukocytosis, Sweet syndrome, hypercalcemia, and a facial rash. He was treated with steroids, antibiotics, and acyclovir. Multiple attempts at lumbar puncture were unsuccessful. He developed angioedema of the tongue and was eventually transferred to the MICU for further evaluation.

Since being transferred, the patient has been evaluated by neurology, infectious disease, heme-onc, and rheumatology. He continues to have daily fevers, waxing mental status, leukocytosis, and declining platelets. The patient's condition worsened, leading to increased work of breathing and hypoxemia, resulting in intubation.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several potential medical complications, including:
1. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and extensive imaging of the CNS has been negative. The cause of the encephalopathy is unclear, but it may be due to a toxic or metabolic condition.
2. Pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy: The patient has nodular peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen on CT. The cause of these findings is unclear, with possibilities including infection,"

   HPI:
    66 year old man with PMHx lung cancer 6 yrs ago, s/p RUL lobectomy (no
   chemo or XRT), as well as spondolithiasis s/p two laminectomies.  He
   initially presented to [**Hospital 755**] Hospital in mid-[**Month (only) 539**].  He lives in
   [**State 5568**], although he and his wife have been in the process of moving
   back to [**Location (un) 23**].  About two weeks after returning from [**State 5568**] he began
   to have lower back pain, first on the right and then on the left as
   well.  He then developed fevers and a cough.  He was also
   intermittently confused.  CT/MRI of the head and spine notable only for
   a intervertebral disc protrusion.  He also developed a progressive
   leukocytosis, but all cultures have remained negative.  He developed a
   facial rash while at [**Location (un) 755**], with a biopsy consistent with Sweet
   syndrome.  This resolved with steroids.  A bone marrow biopsy
   reportedly showed myelodysplasia bot no frank malignancy.  He was
   briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, but these
   were then discontinued in light of the lack of evidence of infection.
   He also had some angioedema of the tongue while there, which resolved.
   Multiple attempts at LP were made, but were unsuccessful.  He was
   treated empirically with steroids, with no benefit.  He was also found
   to be hyperfcalcemic, and was treated with pamidronate.  He was
   eventually transferred here on [**9-16**] for further evaluation.
         Since being transferred here he has been evaluated by neurology,
   infectious disease, heme-onc and rheumatology.  Bone marrow biopsy has
   been repeated and is pending.  LP was done, but appears to have been a
   very bloody tap, so has not been very helpful diagnostically.  He has
   continued to be febrile daily as high as 103, and has had waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.  Other notable findings have been a very high
   ferritin, declining platelets, declining HCT, and continued
   leukocytosis, although this is trending down as well.  From [**Date range (1) 10680**]
   he had some worsening shortness of breath, and CT of the chest shows
   some peripheral infiltrates and significant lymphadenopathy, including
   a 4cm subcarinal node.  He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure and was intubated on the day of transfer.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old man with fevers, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
   hypercalcemia, rash consistent with Sweet
s syndrome, and now nodular
   peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as a pancreatic lesion seen on CT.  He is
   transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia.
   FEVER:  Unclear etiology.  Covering broadly with antibiotics.  All
   cultures negative to date.  ? neoplastic cause.  Records from [**State 5568**]
   now reveal that his past lung tumor was a carcinoid.  ? if this is
   metastatic carcinoid.  Will consult endocrine today. Treating fever
   with tylenol/motrin/cooling blanket.
   NEURO:  No clear cause, likely toxic/metabolic form underlying process,
   but planning repeat MRI brain and spine when stable enough.
   PULMONARY:   Worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.  The
   cause for the infiltrates seen on CT is unclear.  Infection seems
   unlikely in light of his lack of inprovement on antibiotics (which were
   restarted here) and the so far negative work up. The nodular appearance
   and the impressive lymphadenopathy in conjunction with his labs suggest
   some hematologic or inflammatory cause.  Intubated yesterday.
   Increased tachypnea overnight.  Blood gases show adequate oxygenation,
   but he is much more tachycardic, and sats only 93%  on 80%.  Not
   responsive to trials of higher PEEP, and will keep on 8 of PEEP for
   now.  [**Month (only) 51**] need higher sedation to decrease accessory muscles use and
   lower expiratory pressures.
   CV: Hypotension, unclear etiology.  Suspect SIRS picture, although
   whether or not there is infection present is unclear.  Was on levophed
   since yesterday afternoon, but more tachycardica as well. ? adrenal
   insufficiency from rapid steroid taper.  Will try stress dose steroids
   to see if BP improves.  Also will switch pressor to neo to minimize
   tachyphylaxis.  TTE done a few days ago with very poor windows.
   Concerned about valvular disease or tachymyopathy as cause for
   worsening tachycardia.  Will plan for TEE tomorrow.
   ID: All cultures to date are negative, sputum culture pending.  Being
   covered broadly with vanco, pip-tazo, and doxycycline.  ID following
   with us.  Bronch/Bal planned for today.  Parasite smear sent today
   negative. Continue empiric antibiotics
   RHEUM:  The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, very high ferritin and ESR,
   and sweet
s syndrome are all suggestive of some sort of rheumatologic
   process,  Still
s disease can cause may of these findings, but would
   not explain his pulmonary findings or the now-developing hypotension
   and respiratory failure.   The fact that he failed to improved after
   several days of decadron does go against  most rheumatologic causes,
   but biopsy of a lymph node will be helpful in ruling this out.
   Currently weaning decadron to off, but now trying stress dose steroids
   due to hypotension.
   HEME: Suspect neoplastic process and now developing DIC.  Schistocytes
   seen on the last peripheral smear, although fibrinogen was elvevated
   when checked earlier today.  Will continue to trend haptoglobin and
   fibrinogen.  Repeat bone marrow biopsy pending.  Hct and platelets
   stable overnight.  Got vitamin K for coagulopathy, INR now 1.8.  HIT
   antibody snet per heme recs.  He is not currently on any heparin.
   ENDO:  History of lung carcinoid as above.  We are now questioning if
   his presnetation could be secondary to metastatic carcinoid.  Also has
   high PTH and hypercalcemia, and a pancreatic lesion.  Endocrine consult
   placed today. Hyperclcemia has resolved (one dose pamidronate given at
   OSH).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of lung cancer, spondylitis, and multiple medical conditions.
- He presented with lower back pain, fevers, cough, confusion, leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), and a facial rash consistent with Sweet syndrome.
- The patient underwent multiple tests, including CT/MRI scans of the head and spine, bone marrow biopsy, and lumbar puncture, which were inconclusive or showed no significant findings.
- He was treated with steroids, antibiotics, and acyclovir, but his symptoms did not improve.
- The patient developed hypercalcemia (high calcium levels), angioedema (swelling of the tongue), and a pancreatic lesion on CT scan.
- His condition worsened, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure, and he was intubated in the MICU.
- Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 80%.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), elevated D-dimer levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests.
- The patient's fever persists despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and his hypotension requires vasopressor support.
- The assessment includes possible causes such as neoplastic disease, hematologic disorders, inflammatory conditions, and sepsis.

   HPI:
    66 year old man with PMHx lung cancer 6 yrs ago, s/p RUL lobectomy (no
   chemo or XRT), as well as spondolithiasis s/p two laminectomies.  He
   initially presented to [**Hospital 755**] Hospital in mid-[**Month (only) 539**].  He lives in
   [**State 5568**], although he and his wife have been in the process of moving
   back to [**Location (un) 23**].  About two weeks after returning from [**State 5568**] he began
   to have lower back pain, first on the right and then on the left as
   well.  He then developed fevers and a cough.  He was also
   intermittently confused.  CT/MRI of the head and spine notable only for
   a intervertebral disc protrusion.  He also developed a progressive
   leukocytosis, but all cultures have remained negative.  He developed a
   facial rash while at [**Location (un) 755**], with a biopsy consistent with Sweet
   syndrome.  This resolved with steroids.  A bone marrow biopsy
   reportedly showed myelodysplasia bot no frank malignancy.  He was
   briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, but these
   were then discontinued in light of the lack of evidence of infection.
   He also had some angioedema of the tongue while there, which resolved.
   Multiple attempts at LP were made, but were unsuccessful.  He was
   treated empirically with steroids, with no benefit.  He was also found
   to be hyperfcalcemic, and was treated with pamidronate.  He was
   eventually transferred here on [**9-16**] for further evaluation.
         Since being transferred here he has been evaluated by neurology,
   infectious disease, heme-onc and rheumatology.  Bone marrow biopsy has
   been repeated and is pending.  LP was done, but appears to have been a
   very bloody tap, so has not been very helpful diagnostically.  He has
   continued to be febrile daily as high as 103, and has had waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.  Other notable findings have been a very high
   ferritin, declining platelets, declining HCT, and continued
   leukocytosis, although this is trending down as well.  From [**Date range (1) 10680**]
   he had some worsening shortness of breath, and CT of the chest shows
   some peripheral infiltrates and significant lymphadenopathy, including
   a 4cm subcarinal node.  He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure and was intubated on the day of transfer.

CT/MRI of the head and spine showed only intervertebral disc protrusion. He developed leukocytosis, but cultures remained negative. He had facial rash consistent with Sweet syndrome, which resolved with steroids. A bone marrow biopsy showed myelodysplasia but no frank malignancy. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir, but these were discontinued due to lack of evidence of infection. He also experienced angioedema of the tongue, which resolved. Multiple attempts at lumbar puncture were unsuccessful. He was evaluated by various specialists, including neurology, infectious disease, heme-onc, and rheumatology. Bone marrow biopsy is pending. Lumbar puncture was bloody and not helpful diagnostically. He continues to have high fevers, declining platelets, declining HCT, leukocytosis, and worsening shortness of breath.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old man with fevers, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
   hypercalcemia, rash consistent with Sweet
s syndrome, and now nodular
   peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as a pancreatic lesion seen on CT.  He is
   transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia.
   NEURO:  Mental status waxes and wanes, and extensive imaging of the CNS
   all negative.  Unclear if LP was a valid sample.  Currently appears to
   be a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Now intubated, sedated.  Will
   receive imaging from OSH today and will review it with radiology here.
   Neuro had recommended cisternal tap to eval CSF, but holding off for
   now.
   PULMONARY:   Worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.  The
   cause for the infiltrates seen on CT is unclear.  Infection seems
   unlikely in light of his lack of inprovement on antibiotics (which were
   restarted here) and the so far negative work up. The nodular appearance
   and the impressive lymphadenopathy in conjunction with his labs suggest
   some hematologic or inflammatory cause.  Intubated yesterday.
   Increased PEEP this AM, and blood gas improving.  Weaning FiO2.   Will
   plan for bronch/BAL today.  Also consulted thoracics for possible
   mediastinoscopy for node biopsy
   CV: Hypotension, unclear etiology.  Suspect SIRS picture, although
   whether or not there is infection present is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 10653**] as
   needed to maintain BP, and will start pressors if needed.  Central line
   placed for more access, and BP currently stable with fluids.
   ID: All cultures to date are negative, sputum culture pending.  Being
   covered broadly with vanco, pip-tazo, and doxycycline.  ID following
   with us.  Bronch/Bal planned for today.  Parasite smear sent today
   negative. Continue empiric antibiotics
   RHEUM:  The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, very high ferritin and ESR,
   and sweet
s syndrome are all suggestive of some sort of rheumatologic
   process,  Still
s disease can cause may of these findings, but would
   not explain his pulmonary findings or the now-developing hypotension
   and respiratory failure.   The fact that he failed to improved after
   several days of decadron does go against  most rheumatologic causes,
   but biopsy of a lymph node will be helpful in ruling this out.
   Currently eaning decadron to off.  If he worsens clinically, we may
   need to increase steroids again to see if this has any effect.
   HEME: Suspect neoplastic process and now developing DIC.  Schistocytes
   seen on the last peripheral smear, although fibrinogen was elvevated
   when checked earlier today.  Will continue to trend haptoglobin and
   fibrinogen.  Repeat bone marrow biopsy pending.  Transfused pRBC
   overnight.  Platelets stable, WBC stable in the mid 20
s.  FFP given
   today for central line placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of lung cancer, spondylolithiasis, and multiple medical interventions. He presented with lower back pain, fevers, cough, confusion, leukocytosis, facial rash consistent with Sweet syndrome, and hypercalcemia. The patient also has nodular peripheral pulmonary infiltrates, significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a pancreatic lesion seen on CT. He was transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia. The patient is now intubated and sedated.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    66 year old man with PMHx lung cancer 6 yrs ago, s/p RUL lobectomy (no
   chemo or XRT), as well as spondolithiasis s/p two laminectomies.  He
   initially presented to [**Hospital 755**] Hospital in mid-[**Month (only) 539**].  He lives in
   [**State 5568**], although he and his wife have been in the process of moving
   back to [**Location (un) 23**].  About two weeks after returning from [**State 5568**] he began
   to have lower back pain, first on the right and then on the left as
   well.  He then developed fevers and a cough.  He was also
   intermittently confused.  CT/MRI of the head and spine notable only for
   a intervertebral disc protrusion.  He also developed a progressive
   leukocytosis, but all cultures have remained negative.  He developed a
   facial rash while at [**Location (un) 755**], with a biopsy consistent with Sweet
   syndrome.  This resolved with steroids.  A bone marrow biopsy
   reportedly showed myelodysplasia bot no frank malignancy.  He was
   briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, but these
   were then discontinued in light of the lack of evidence of infection.
   He also had some angioedema of the tongue while there, which resolved.
   Multiple attempts at LP were made, but were unsuccessful.  He was
   treated empirically with steroids, with no benefit.  He was also found
   to be hyperfcalcemic, and was treated with pamidronate.  He was
   eventually transferred here on [**9-16**] for further evaluation.
         Since being transferred here he has been evaluated by neurology,
   infectious disease, heme-onc and rheumatology.  Bone marrow biopsy has
   been repeated and is pending.  LP was done, but appears to have been a
   very bloody tap, so has not been very helpful diagnostically.  He has
   continued to be febrile daily as high as 103, and has had waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.  Other notable findings have been a very high
   ferritin, declining platelets, declining HCT, and continued
   leukocytosis, although this is trending down as well.  From [**Date range (1) 10680**]
   he had some worsening shortness of breath, and CT of the chest shows
   some peripheral infiltrates and significant lymphadenopathy, including
   a 4cm subcarinal node.  He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure and was intubated on the day of transfer.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old man with fevers, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
   hypercalcemia, rash consistent with Sweet
s syndrome, and now nodular
   peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as a pancreatic lesion seen on CT.  He is
   transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia.
   NEURO:  Mental status waxes and wanes, and extensive imaging of the CNS
   all negative.  Unclear if LP was a valid sample.  Currently appears to
   be a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Now intubated, sedated.  Will
   receive imaging from OSH today and will review it with radiology here.
   Neuro had recommended cisternal tap to eval CSF, but holding off for
   now.
   PULMONARY:   Worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.  The
   cause for the infiltrates seen on CT is unclear.  Infection seems
   unlikely in light of his lack of inprovement on antibiotics (which were
   restarted here) and the so far negative work up. The nodular appearance
   and the impressive lymphadenopathy in conjunction with his labs suggest
   some hematologic or inflammatory cause.  Intubated yesterday.
   Increased PEEP this AM, and blood gas improving.  Weaning FiO2.   Will
   plan for bronch/BAL today.  Also consulted thoracics for possible
   mediastinoscopy for node biopsy
   CV: Hypotension, unclear etiology.  Suspect SIRS picture, although
   whether or not there is infection present is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 10653**] as
   needed to maintain BP, and will start pressors if needed.  Central line
   placed for more access, and BP currently stable with fluids.
   ID: All cultures to date are negative, sputum culture pending.  Being
   covered broadly with vanco, pip-tazo, and doxycycline.  ID following
   with us.  Bronch/Bal planned for today.  Parasite smear sent today
   negative. Continue empiric antibiotics
   RHEUM:  The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, very high ferritin and ESR,
   and sweet
s syndrome are all suggestive of some sort of rheumatologic
   process,  Still
s disease can cause may of these findings, but would
   not explain his pulmonary findings or the now-developing hypotension
   and respiratory failure.   The fact that he failed to improved after
   several days of decadron does go against  most rheumatologic causes,
   but biopsy of a lymph node will be helpful in ruling this out.
   Currently eaning decadron to off.  If he worsens clinically, we may
   need to increase steroids again to see if this has any effect.
   HEME: Suspect neoplastic process and now developing DIC.  Schistocytes
   seen on the last peripheral smear, although fibrinogen was elvevated
   when checked earlier today.  Will continue to trend haptoglobin and
   fibrinogen.  Repeat bone marrow biopsy pending.  Transfused pRBC
   overnight.  Platelets stable, WBC stable in the mid 20
s.  FFP given
   today for central line placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of lung cancer and spondylitis. He presented to the hospital with lower back pain, fevers, cough, and confusion. He was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir but these were discontinued due to negative cultures. The patient developed a facial rash consistent with Sweet syndrome, which resolved with steroids. A bone marrow biopsy showed myelodysplasia but no frank malignancy. He also had angioedema of the tongue and unsuccessful attempts at lumbar puncture. The patient was transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing indicate respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes and negative extensive imaging suggest a possible toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
3. Infection: Despite negative cultures, the patient's persistent fevers and leukocytosis raise concerns for an underlying infection, possibly pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Hematologic disorder: The patient's laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, and schistocytes on peripheral smear indicate a possible hematologic disorder, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or a hematologic malignancy.
5. Rheumatologic process: The high fevers, lymphadenopathy, and elevated inflammatory markers suggest a possible rheumatologic process, such as Still's disease.
6. Neoplastic process: The presence of nodular peripheral pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a pancreatic lesion on CT raises concerns for a neoplastic process, potentially a relapse of the patient's previous lung cancer or a new malignancy.
7. Sweet syndrome: The patient's facial rash and high ferritin levels are consistent with Sweet syndrome, which can be associated with underlying malignancies or autoimmune conditions.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note and further evaluation may be needed to confirm or rule out these possibilities."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    66 year old man with PMHx lung cancer 6 yrs ago, s/p RUL lobectomy (no
   chemo or XRT), as well as spondolithiasis s/p two laminectomies.  He
   initially presented to [**Hospital 755**] Hospital in mid-[**Month (only) 539**].  He lives in
   [**State 5568**], although he and his wife have been in the process of moving
   back to [**Location (un) 23**].  About two weeks after returning from [**State 5568**] he began
   to have lower back pain, first on the right and then on the left as
   well.  He then developed fevers and a cough.  He was also
   intermittently confused.  CT/MRI of the head and spine notable only for
   a intervertebral disc protrusion.  He also developed a progressive
   leukocytosis, but all cultures have remained negative.  He developed a
   facial rash while at [**Location (un) 755**], with a biopsy consistent with Sweet
   syndrome.  This resolved with steroids.  A bone marrow biopsy
   reportedly showed myelodysplasia bot no frank malignancy.  He was
   briefly on broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, but these
   were then discontinued in light of the lack of evidence of infection.
   He also had some angioedema of the tongue while there, which resolved.
   Multiple attempts at LP were made, but were unsuccessful.  He was
   treated empirically with steroids, with no benefit.  He was also found
   to be hyperfcalcemic, and was treated with pamidronate.  He was
   eventually transferred here on [**9-16**] for further evaluation.
         Since being transferred here he has been evaluated by neurology,
   infectious disease, heme-onc and rheumatology.  Bone marrow biopsy has
   been repeated and is pending.  LP was done, but appears to have been a
   very bloody tap, so has not been very helpful diagnostically.  He has
   continued to be febrile daily as high as 103, and has had waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status.  Other notable findings have been a very high
   ferritin, declining platelets, declining HCT, and continued
   leukocytosis, although this is trending down as well.  From [**Date range (1) 10680**]
   he had some worsening shortness of breath, and CT of the chest shows
   some peripheral infiltrates and significant lymphadenopathy, including
   a 4cm subcarinal node.  He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure and was intubated on the day of transfer.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old man with fevers, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
   hypercalcemia, rash consistent with Sweet
s syndrome, and now nodular
   peripheral pulmonary infiltrates and significant mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as a pancreatic lesion seen on CT.  He is
   transferred to the MICU for increased work of breathing and hypoxemia.
   FEVER:  Unclear etiology.  Covering broadly with antibiotics.  All
   cultures negative to date.  ? neoplastic cause.  Records from [**State 5568**]
   now reveal that his past lung tumor was a carcinoid.  ? if this is
   metastatic carcinoid.  Will consult endocrine today. Treating fever
   with tylenol/motrin/cooling blanket.
   NEURO:  No clear cause, likely toxic/metabolic form underlying process,
   but planning repeat MRI brain and spine when stable enough.
   PULMONARY:   Worsening hypoxemia and increased work of breathing.  The
   cause for the infiltrates seen on CT is unclear.  Infection seems
   unlikely in light of his lack of inprovement on antibiotics (which were
   restarted here) and the so far negative work up. The nodular appearance
   and the impressive lymphadenopathy in conjunction with his labs suggest
   some hematologic or inflammatory cause.  Intubated yesterday.
   Increased tachypnea overnight.  Blood gases show adequate oxygenation,
   but he is much more tachycardic, and sats only 93%  on 80%.  Not
   responsive to trials of higher PEEP, and will keep on 8 of PEEP for
   now.  [**Month (only) 51**] need higher sedation to decrease accessory muscles use and
   lower expiratory pressures.
   CV: Hypotension, unclear etiology.  Suspect SIRS picture, although
   whether or not there is infection present is unclear.  Was on levophed
   since yesterday afternoon, but more tachycardica as well. ? adrenal
   insufficiency from rapid steroid taper.  Will try stress dose steroids
   to see if BP improves.  Also will switch pressor to neo to minimize
   tachyphylaxis.  TTE done a few days ago with very poor windows.
   Concerned about valvular disease or tachymyopathy as cause for
   worsening tachycardia.  Will plan for TEE tomorrow.
   ID: All cultures to date are negative, sputum culture pending.  Being
   covered broadly with vanco, pip-tazo, and doxycycline.  ID following
   with us.  Bronch/Bal planned for today.  Parasite smear sent today
   negative. Continue empiric antibiotics

   and respiratory failure.   The fact that he failed to improved after
   several days of decadron does go against  most rheumatologic causes,
   but biopsy of a lymph node will be helpful in ruling this out.
   Currently weaning decadron to off, but now trying stress dose steroids
   due to hypotension.
   HEME: Suspect neoplastic process and now developing DIC.  Schistocytes
   seen on the last peripheral smear, although fibrinogen was elvevated
   when checked earlier today.  Will continue to trend haptoglobin and
   fibrinogen.  Repeat bone marrow biopsy pending.  Hct and platelets
   stable overnight.  Got vitamin K for coagulopathy, INR now 1.8.  HIT
   antibody snet per heme recs.  He is not currently on any heparin.
   ENDO:  History of lung carcinoid as above.  We are now questioning if
   his presnetation could be secondary to metastatic carcinoid.  Also has
   high PTH and hypercalcemia, and a pancreatic lesion.  Endocrine consult
   placed today. Hyperclcemia has resolved (one dose pamidronate given at
   OSH).

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o lung CA s/p resection and no adjuvant
   chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs lung ca
   recurrence with possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired
   pneumonia.
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
    - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo.
    -- change to azithro to doxycycline pending atypical w/u, ehrlichia
   smear
    -- add fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- bronch for BAL, cytology and cultures
    -- f/u ID recs
   - For neoplastic processes
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- f/u heme onc recs
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. f/u CTS for biopsy
   - IV decadron [**Hospital1 7**] today and then start prednisone 10 mg in AM
   (treatment of Sweets)
   # Hypotension: warm, likely distributive, no clear e/o shock at this
   point
   - IVF for support, alternate LR with saline given hyperchloremia.
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - if no head MRI at OSH, will need MRI head here today
   # Pneumonia, Atypical vs. Hospital Acquired, hypoxia, increased AA
   gradient. basilar infiltrates suspicious for superimposed infectious
   process, though certainly this could be neoplastic. Also ? aspiration/
   mucous plugging today
   - BAL today
   - continue vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - obtain MRI from OSH for reads here at [**Hospital1 19**]
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding.
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] fibrinogen
   - consider vitamin K
   # History of Lung Cancer: Unknown type, will seek additional records.
   Lymph node supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue
   diagnosis is needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with
   subcarinal node first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing
   # Leukocytosis: still elevated today
   - f/u cultures
   - c. difficile today
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease.
   - guiaic all stools
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - continuing to taper steroids, with caveat that if pt clinically
   worsens we may need to actually increase steroids. Unclear what is
   being treated at this juncture.
   # FEN
   - NPO for now.
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes heme malignancy vs lung cancer recurrence with the possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient also has a coagulopathy with elevated INR and schistocytes on peripheral smear, suggesting a consumptive coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Other findings include hypercalcemia, elevated ferritin, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being evaluated for possible infections, neoplastic processes, and Sweet syndrome/neutrophilic dermatoses. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia due to his immunocompromised state and presence of pulmonary infiltrates. Infection could worsen his respiratory status and lead to sepsis.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or distributive shock. This could progress to cardiogenic shock or hypovolemic shock if not managed appropriately.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o lung CA s/p resection and no adjuvant
   chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs lung ca
   recurrence with possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired
   pneumonia.
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
    - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo.
    -- change to azithro to doxycycline pending atypical w/u, ehrlichia
   smear
    -- add fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- bronch for BAL, cytology and cultures
    -- f/u ID recs
   - For neoplastic processes
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- f/u heme onc recs
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. f/u CTS for biopsy
   - IV decadron [**Hospital1 7**] today and then start prednisone 10 mg in AM
   (treatment of Sweets)
   # Hypotension: warm, likely distributive, no clear e/o shock at this
   point
   - IVF for support, alternate LR with saline given hyperchloremia.
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - if no head MRI at OSH, will need MRI head here today
   # Pneumonia, Atypical vs. Hospital Acquired, hypoxia, increased AA
   gradient. basilar infiltrates suspicious for superimposed infectious
   process, though certainly this could be neoplastic. Also ? aspiration/
   mucous plugging today
   - BAL today
   - continue vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - obtain MRI from OSH for reads here at [**Hospital1 19**]
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding.
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] fibrinogen
   - consider vitamin K
   # History of Lung Cancer: Unknown type, will seek additional records.
   Lymph node supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue
   diagnosis is needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with
   subcarinal node first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing
   # Leukocytosis: still elevated today
   - f/u cultures
   - c. difficile today
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease.
   - guiaic all stools
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - continuing to taper steroids, with caveat that if pt clinically
   worsens we may need to actually increase steroids. Unclear what is
   being treated at this juncture.
   # FEN
   - NPO for now.
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add the
   following:  Mr. [**Known lastname 10650**] remains very ill with respiratory failure,
   fevers, high WBC, hypotension requiring pressors.  We do not have a
   unifying dx at this point
 awaiting bone marrow biopsy final results.
   Unfortunately, he is too sick at this point for mediastinal node
   sampling.  We will continue with ARDSnet ventilation strategy, though I
   am concerned that his left lung is more complaint than R and is seeing
   most of the delivered volume.  Cont current abx regimen.  Also starting
   empiric high dose steroids at 125mg iv SoluMedrol q8hrs given multiple
   possible indications of systemic inflammatory process.  Pt is
   critically ill.  Time spent: 45 minutes.

","The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman with a history of lung cancer who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes heme malignancy, lung cancer recurrence, and superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, altered mental status, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, Sweet syndrome/neutrophilic dermatoses, and potential parathyroid involvement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic shock due to untreated infection.
2. Progressive respiratory failure due to worsening ARDS.
3. Hemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction due to consumptive coagulopathy/DIC.
4. Development of complications related to long-term steroid use (e.g., osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension).
5. Malignancy progression or metastasis.
6. Complications related to central line insertion (e.g., line infection, thrombosis).
7. Complications related to intubation and mechanical ventilation (e.g., ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma).

These are just some of the potential complications that can arise based on the provided information. The actual complications may vary depending on the patient's response to treatment and any additional underlying conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o lung CA s/p resection and no adjuvant
   chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs lung ca
   recurrence with possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired
   pneumonia.
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
    - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo.
    -- change to azithro to doxycycline pending atypical w/u, ehrlichia
   smear
    -- add fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- bronch for BAL, cytology and cultures
    -- f/u ID recs
   - For neoplastic processes
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- f/u heme onc recs
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. f/u CTS for biopsy
   - IV decadron [**Hospital1 7**] today and then start prednisone 10 mg in AM
   (treatment of Sweets)
   # Hypotension: warm, likely distributive, no clear e/o shock at this
   point
   - IVF for support, alternate LR with saline given hyperchloremia.
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - if no head MRI at OSH, will need MRI head here today
   # Pneumonia, Atypical vs. Hospital Acquired, hypoxia, increased AA
   gradient. basilar infiltrates suspicious for superimposed infectious
   process, though certainly this could be neoplastic. Also ? aspiration/
   mucous plugging today
   - BAL today
   - continue vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - obtain MRI from OSH for reads here at [**Hospital1 19**]
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding.
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] fibrinogen
   - consider vitamin K
   # History of Lung Cancer: Unknown type, will seek additional records.
   Lymph node supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue
   diagnosis is needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with
   subcarinal node first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing
   # Leukocytosis: still elevated today
   - f/u cultures
   - c. difficile today
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease.
   - guiaic all stools
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - continuing to taper steroids, with caveat that if pt clinically
   worsens we may need to actually increase steroids. Unclear what is
   being treated at this juncture.
   # FEN
   - NPO for now.
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old gentleman with a history of lung cancer who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The assessment suggests that the patient may have a neoplastic process, such as lung cancer recurrence or a new malignancy, or a superimposed infectious process. The presence of fever, hypoxia, and elevated inflammatory markers further supports the possibility of an infection, either atypical or hospital-acquired.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Consumptive coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and schistocytes, which could indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or a consumptive coagulopathy. This condition can lead to bleeding or thrombosis.

2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia raise the concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Prompt identification and treatment are essential to prevent further complications.

3. Heme malignancy: The elevated ferritin and presence of atypical cells in the peripheral smear suggest a possible heme malignancy, such as leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Further evaluation with a bone marrow biopsy is necessary for confirmation.

4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which can be caused by malignancy or primary hyper"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o lung CA s/p resection and no adjuvant
   chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs lung ca
   recurrence with possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired
   pneumonia.
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
    - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo.
    -- change to azithro to doxycycline pending atypical w/u, ehrlichia
   smear
    -- add fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- bronch for BAL, cytology and cultures
    -- f/u ID recs
   - For neoplastic processes
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- f/u heme onc recs
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. f/u CTS for biopsy
   - IV decadron [**Hospital1 7**] today and then start prednisone 10 mg in AM
   (treatment of Sweets)
   # Hypotension: warm, likely distributive, no clear e/o shock at this
   point
   - IVF for support, alternate LR with saline given hyperchloremia.
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - if no head MRI at OSH, will need MRI head here today
   # Pneumonia, Atypical vs. Hospital Acquired, hypoxia, increased AA
   gradient. basilar infiltrates suspicious for superimposed infectious
   process, though certainly this could be neoplastic. Also ? aspiration/
   mucous plugging today
   - BAL today
   - continue vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - obtain MRI from OSH for reads here at [**Hospital1 19**]
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding.
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] fibrinogen
   - consider vitamin K
   # History of Lung Cancer: Unknown type, will seek additional records.
   Lymph node supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue
   diagnosis is needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with
   subcarinal node first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing
   # Leukocytosis: still elevated today
   - f/u cultures
   - c. difficile today
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease.
   - guiaic all stools
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - continuing to taper steroids, with caveat that if pt clinically
   worsens we may need to actually increase steroids. Unclear what is
   being treated at this juncture.
   # FEN
   - NPO for now.
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o carcinoid  lung CA s/p resection and no
   adjuvant chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs carcinoid ca
   recurrence with possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired
   pneumonia.
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
    - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo, doxy
    -- f/u  ehrlichia smear
    -- f/u fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- f/u bronch for BAL, cytology and cultures
    -- f/u ID recs
   - For neoplastic processes
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- f/u heme onc recs
   -- endo consult
   -- 600mg motrin alternating with Tylenol for defervese
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. f/u CTS for biopsy
   -- start stress dose steroids today for hypotension and potential
   treatment of Sweets
   -possible TEE on tuesday
   # Hypotension: warm, likely distributive, no clear e/o shock at this
   point
   - IVF for support, alternate LR with saline given hyperchloremia
   -switch pressor support  to neo map>55
   -stress dose steroids today for potential adrenal suppression
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - if no head MRI at OSH, will need MRI head here but will hold off
   given instability
   # Pneumonia, Atypical vs. Hospital Acquired, hypoxia, increased AA
   gradient. basilar infiltrates suspicious for superimposed infectious
   process, though certainly this could be neoplastic. Also ? aspiration/
   mucous plugging today and ARDS. Working hard to breath on vent.
   - f/u BAL cultures
   -appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   - increase PEEP on vent, f/u repeat ABG
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - hold off repeating MRI for now given hemodynamic instability
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding. Platelets falling.
   - f/u HIT antibodies
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] fibrinogen
   - consider vitamin K for INR>2
   # History of Lung Cancer: OSH show history of carcinoid. Lymph node
   supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue diagnosis is
   needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with subcarinal node
   first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing.
   -d/w IP
   # Leukocytosis: still elevated today
   - f/u cultures
   - c. difficile today
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   -appreciate heme/onc recs
   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease. Potential
   source of bleeding include gastritis.
   - guiaic all stools
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   -f/u hit antibodies
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   -endo consult today
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - stress dosed steroid for now
   # FEN
   - starting tube feeds today
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman with a history of carcinoid lung cancer, who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes heme malignancy vs. carcinoid tumor recurrence with a possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Plan:
- Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and doxycycline.
- Follow up on fungal markers (galactomannan), ehrlichia smear, bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (BAL), and cultures.
- Consult with infectious disease team.
- Consider tissue biopsy, especially from the lymph node, possibly under bronchoscopy if possible.
- Consult with hematology/oncology team.
- Stress dose steroids today for hypotension and potential treatment of Sweet's syndrome.
- Possible transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) on Tuesday.
- Hold off on repeating MRI for now given hemodynamic instability.
- Trend platelets, consider vitamin K for INR > 2, and transfuse for active bleeding or platelet count < 10.
- Follow up on c. difficile test and peripheral flow cytometry.
- Bone marrow biopsy is pending.
- Active thrombocytopenia workup, including guaiac all stools and HIT antibodies.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o carcinoid  lung CA s/p resection and no
   adjuvant chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs carcinoid ca
   recurrence with possibility of superimposed hospital-acquired
   pneumonia.
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
    - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo, doxy
    -- f/u  ehrlichia smear
    -- f/u fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- f/u bronch for BAL, cytology and cultures
    -- f/u ID recs
   - For neoplastic processes
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- f/u heme onc recs
   -- endo consult
   -- 600mg motrin alternating with Tylenol for defervese
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. f/u CTS for biopsy
   -- start stress dose steroids today for hypotension and potential
   treatment of Sweets
   -possible TEE on tuesday
   # Hypotension: warm, likely distributive, no clear e/o shock at this
   point
   - IVF for support, alternate LR with saline given hyperchloremia
   -switch pressor support  to neo map>55
   -stress dose steroids today for potential adrenal suppression
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - if no head MRI at OSH, will need MRI head here but will hold off
   given instability
   # Pneumonia, Atypical vs. Hospital Acquired, hypoxia, increased AA
   gradient. basilar infiltrates suspicious for superimposed infectious
   process, though certainly this could be neoplastic. Also ? aspiration/
   mucous plugging today and ARDS. Working hard to breath on vent.
   - f/u BAL cultures
   -appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   - increase PEEP on vent, f/u repeat ABG
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - hold off repeating MRI for now given hemodynamic instability
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding. Platelets falling.
   - f/u HIT antibodies
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] fibrinogen
   - consider vitamin K for INR>2
   # History of Lung Cancer: OSH show history of carcinoid. Lymph node
   supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue diagnosis is
   needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with subcarinal node
   first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing.
   -d/w IP
   # Leukocytosis: still elevated today
   - f/u cultures
   - c. difficile today
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   -appreciate heme/onc recs
   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease. Potential
   source of bleeding include gastritis.
   - guiaic all stools
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   -f/u hit antibodies
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   -endo consult today
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - stress dosed steroid for now
   # FEN
   - starting tube feeds today
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer, presenting with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes hematologic malignancy, carcinoid tumor recurrence, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, altered mental status, hypoxia, increased arterial-alveolar gradient, coagulopathy, history of lung cancer, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, and Sweet syndrome/neutrophilic dermatoses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematologic malignancy: The patient's symptoms, such as mediastinal lymphadenopathy, anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated ferritin levels, raise suspicion for a hematologic malignancy. Further evaluation is needed, including a bone marrow biopsy.
2. Carcinoid tumor recurrence: Given the patient's history of carcinoid lung cancer, the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy could indicate tumor recurrence. Tissue diagnosis is necessary to confirm this.
3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary infiltrates and worsening hypoxia suggest the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further investigations like bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures are recommended.

   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer, who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes hematologic malignancy, carcinoid cancer recurrence, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and pressor support. Laboratory results indicate elevated inflammatory markers and evidence of possible consumptive coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guide appropriate management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematologic malignancy: The presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated ferritin suggests the possibility of a hematologic malignancy such as lymphoma or myelodysplasia. Further investigations, including bone marrow biopsy, are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Carcinoid cancer recurrence: Given the patient's history of carcinoid lung cancer, the possibility of cancer recurrence should be considered. Tissue diagnosis is necessary to confirm this suspicion, and a subcarinal lymph node biopsy may be indicated.
3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The presence of pulmonary infiltrates and elevated white blood cell count raises concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigations, such as bron"

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. He is suspected to have hematologic malignancy or recurrence of carcinoid cancer with possible superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. He is on mechanical ventilation with increased airway pressures and has a rising lactate level.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and pulmonary infiltrates, which suggest a possible infection such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or a bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigations for infectious sources are planned.

2. Hematologic Malignancy: The patient's leukocytosis, anemia, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy raise suspicion for hematologic malignancy. Bone marrow biopsy and consultation with a hematologist/oncologist are recommended for further evaluation.

3. Carcinoid Cancer Recurrence: Given the patient's history of carcinoid lung cancer, the possibility of tumor recurrence should be considered. Tissue diagnosis is needed to confirm the presence of recurrence or a second malignancy.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o carcinoid  lung CA s/p resection and no
   adjuvant chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs carcinoid ca
   recurrence, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS.
   #Hypoxemic resp failure [**1-12**] ARDS
 continues to be difficult to
   oxygenate; Cx data neg to date
   -low Vt ventilation, cont current PEEP setting
   -wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 80
   -cont broad-spectrum ABX (vanc/zosyn/doxy day 4) for empiric PNA cov
   - f/u BAL cultures
   .
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
    - For Infectious Sources
    -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, pip-tazo, doxy
    -- f/u  ehrlichia smear
    -- f/u fungal markers glucan/galactomannan
    -- f/u bronch for BAL, cytology and cultures
    -- f/u ID recs
   - For neoplastic processes
   -- RUQ U/S to eval for splenomegaly
    -- f/u bone marrow biopsy
    -- f/u heme onc recs
   -- appreciate endo recs
   -- 600mg motrin alternating with Tylenol for defervese
    -- we will need to obtain tissue of the lymph node, possibly under
   bronchoscopy if possible. f/u CTS for biopsy
   # Distributive shock
 switched levo to neo for tachycardia, able to
   wean
   -wean neo gtt to maintain MAP > 65
   -cont stress dose steroids (day 2)
    #Acute renal failure
   -U/A, urine lytes, eos
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - defer MRI pending better clinical stability
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - hold off repeating MRI for now given hemodynamic instability
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding. Platelets falling.
   - f/u HIT antibodies
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] fibrinogen
   - consider vitamin K for INR>2
   # History of Lung Cancer: OSH show history of carcinoid. Lymph node
   supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue diagnosis is
   needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with subcarinal node
   first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing.
   -d/w IP
   # Leukocytosis: still elevated today
   - f/u cultures
   - c. difficile today
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry here
   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.
   -appreciate heme/onc recs
   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease. Potential
   source of bleeding include gastritis.
   - guiaic all stools
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   -f/u hit antibodies
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   -endo consult today
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - stress dosed steroid for now
   # FEN
   - starting tube feeds today
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The patient's condition is concerning for heme malignancy versus carcinoid cancer recurrence, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is a severe form of lung injury causing hypoxemia. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation of the blood and may require mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient has a fever with negative blood cultures, suggesting a potential infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but further evaluation with bronchoscopy and BAL cultures is needed to identify the causative organism.

3. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): The elevated ferritin level and presence of schistocytes on the peripheral smear raise suspicion for HLH, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and excessive immune activation.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a rising INR and falling platelets, indicating a consumptive coagulopathy. This could be secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer, who presented with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. He is currently in the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient continues to have difficulty maintaining oxygenation despite adjustments in ventilation settings. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further cultures are being obtained.

2. Fever: The patient has high fevers with negative blood cultures. Possible causes include neoplastic, infectious, or rheumatologic entities. Enlarged mediastinal nodes suggest lymphoma/myelodysplasia, adenocarcinoma of the lung or pancreas, squamous cell carcinoma, or a reactive process to infection.

3. Pulmonary infiltrates: Suggestive of a superimposed pneumonic process, possibly bacterial, eosinophilic pneumonia, or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given the distribution.

4. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/hemophagocytic syndrome: Elevated ferritin levels and neutrophilic dermatosis on OSH suggest this possibility. BM bx pending for presence.

   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs carcinoid ca
   recurrence, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS.

   -cont broad-spectrum ABX (vanc/zosyn/doxy day 4) for empiric PNA cov
   - f/u BAL cultures
   .
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to

2. Fever: The patient has high fevers with negative blood cultures to date. The source of infection is still unknown and could be neoplastic, infectious, or rheumatologic.
3. Distributive Shock: The patient switched from levo to neo for tachycardia and was able to wean off the pressor. Stress dose steroids have been continued.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's U/A, urine lytes, and eos should be followed. The cause of renal failure may be related to sepsis or direct involvement of the kidneys by the underlying disease.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium, although encephalitis is still a possibility. Hypercalcemia may also be contributing to the altered mental status."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o carcinoid  lung CA s/p resection and no
   adjuvant chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs carcinoid ca
   recurrence, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS.
   #Hypoxemic resp failure [**1-12**] ARDS
 continues to be difficult to
   oxygenate; Cx data neg to date
   - low Vt ventilation, cont current PEEP setting
   - wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 80
   - cont broad-spectrum ABX (vanc/zosyn/doxy day 4) for empiric PNA cov
   - f/u BAL cultures
   .
   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.
    - For Infectious Sources

   - will discuss with IR possibility of cisternal CSF sampling and
   rediscuss with the neurology consulting team.  Presently on hold.
   - defer MRI pending better clinical stability
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - hold off repeating MRI for now given hemodynamic instability
   # Coagulopathy: Concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs. DIC
   given rising INR, and now presence of schistocytes that are a new
   finding. Platelets falling.
   - f/u HIT antibodies
   - Will continue supportive care for now.
   - consider vitamin K for INR>2
   # History of Lung Cancer: OSH show history of carcinoid. Lymph node
   supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue diagnosis is
   needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with subcarinal node
   first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing.

   - f/u bone marrow bx. At this point, appears stressed marrow reaction,
   but presence of atypical cells is concerning for heme malignancy.

   # Anemia: Elevated ferretin favors anemia of chronic disease. Potential
   source of bleeding include gastritis.
   - guaiac all stools
   - active T&S
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to a
   consumptive coagulopathy.  HIT merits consideration given
   hospitalization, though coincidence with rising INR and marrow process
   suggest a more plausible alternate explanation. Her pre-test
   probability [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on 4Ts is 3, and with 0-3 being low will not send
   PF4 test at this time, nor start anticoagulation.
   Also consider vancomycin.
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   - f/u hit antibodies
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   - endo consult today
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.
   # Sweet
s Syndrome / Neutrophilic Dermatoses: likely secondary to a
   second process
   - stress dosed steroid for now
   # FEN
   - cont tube feeds
   - Maintenance with NS, alternating with LR.

","The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The patient's condition is concerning for heme malignancy vs carcinoid cancer recurrence, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS. 

The patient's fever is high with negative blood cultures to date. This could be due to broad-spectrum ABX (vanc/zosyn/doxy day 4) for empiric PNA coverage. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic process, which could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia or fungal pneumonia. 

Given the elevated ferritin level, HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome merits consideration. A bone marrow biopsy is pending for the presence of atypical cells, which would be concerning for heme malignancy. 

The patient has distributive shock, acute renal failure, altered mental status (likely delirium), back pain (likely exacerbation of chronic LBP), coagulopathy (concerning picture for consumptive coagulopathy vs DIC), history of lung cancer, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, Sweet syndrome/neutrophilic dermatoses, and fever of unknown origin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer, who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The patient's condition is concerning for hematologic malignancy versus carcinoid tumor recurrence, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS. The patient has several medical complications, including fever with negative blood cultures, distributive shock, acute renal failure, altered mental status, back pain, HIT-positive/coagulopathy, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, and Sweet syndrome/neutrophilic dermatoses. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, stress dose steroids, and anticoagulation therapy. Further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, including tissue biopsies, blood cultures, and imaging studies. The patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring in the ICU."

   # Fever: High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtfult to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS, fever of unknown origin, distributive shock, acute renal failure, altered mental status, back pain, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, and Sweet syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS: The patient's oxygenation status remains challenging, and efforts are being made to maintain adequate oxygen levels while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Fever of unknown origin: Despite negative blood cultures, the patient continues to have high fevers. Possible causes include neoplastic, infectious, or rheumatologic entities.
3. Distributive shock: The patient has been switched from levo to neo due to tachycardia, and is now off pressures. Stress dose steroids have been initiated.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and they are producing urine but with a high sodium concentration. Pre-renal azotemia is suspected, and the patient has been given 1.5L NS.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year old gentleman with h/o carcinoid  lung CA s/p resection and no
   adjuvant chemo/XRT who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and
   anemia/leukocytosis concerning for heme malignancy vs carcinoid ca
   recurrence, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS.
   #Hypoxemic resp failure [**1-12**] ARDS
 mild improvement in oxygenation; cx
   data neg to date
   - low Vt ventilation, cont current PEEP setting
   - wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 80
   - now on doxycyline alone
   - f/u BAL cultures
   # Fever:  High fevers with negative blood cultures to date could be
   broad between neoplastic, infectious, and rheumatologic entities. Given
   the enlarged mediastinal nodes, this could be lymphoma/myelodyscrasia,
   adenoca of lung or pancreas, squamous ca, or a reactive process to
   infection. The pulmonary infiltrates suggest a superimposed pneumonic
   process, that could be bacterial, or less likely eosinophilic pneumonia
   or fungal pneumonia. DAH or DIP is less likely given distribution.
   Given elevated ferritin >assay ([**2112**]), HLH/hemophagocytic syndrome
   merits consideration. BM bx pending for presence. This is doubtful to
   be primary sweets, and the neutrophilic dermatosis seen on OSH is
   likely secondary to the as of yet undetermined process.  ?drug effect.

   bronchoscopy (would need ETT <8.5, PEEP <5) v. EUS bx (will d/w CTS)
   -- f/u CT scan showing pancreatic nodules concerning for malignancy
   # Distributive shock
 switched levo to neo for tachycardia, able to
   wean, now off pressures

   - avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # Volume overload:
   - will try Lasix 20 mg IV
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes to monitor Cr
   # Altered Mental Status: likely delirium, though cannot r/o
   encephalitis. viral encephalitis serologies are pending. Hypercalcemia
   also contributing, although now corrected. ? carcinoma meningitis.
   - Attempt cisternal CSF sampling (IR) and MRI
   # Back Pain: likely exacerbation of chronic LBP. OSH MRI per d/c
   summary showed no mass/abscess.
   - hold off repeating spine MRI for now given hemodynamic instability
   # HIT positive/coagulopathy:  LE ultrasound neg for clot
   - will follow-up optical density and send off SRA
   - Continue argatroban
   - Appreciate heme recs
   # History of Lung Cancer: OSH show history of carcinoid. Lymph node
   supicious for recurrence or a second malignancy.  Tissue diagnosis is
   needed if marrow bx is unrevealing. Would start with subcarinal node
   first, and potential VATS bx if unrevealing.

   source of bleeding include gastritis.
   - guaiac all stools
   - active T&S
   - pm HCT
   # Thrombocytopenia: Given elevated INR, this is likely related to HIT.
   A consumptive coagulopathy merits consideration. Also consider
   vancomycin.
   - Continue argatroban
   - trend plts
   - transfuse for active bleeding or plt<10
   - check DIC labs, obtain peripheral smear
   # Hypercalcemia: rec'd IV pamidronate, and IV fluids.  PTH is not
   suppressed and is indeed high, suggesting a primary
   hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP pending here.
   - would consider scan for parathyroid adenoma, though will defer this
   and treat hypercalcemia at this point given critical illness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer, who presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS, fever, acute renal failure, volume overload, altered mental status, back pain, HIT positive/coagulopathy, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, and Sweet syndrome/neutrophilic dermatoses. The patient requires further diagnostic evaluations and interventions for various medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS: The patient is experiencing difficulty in oxygenation, and there is a mild improvement in oxygenation but still requires assistance.
2. Fever: The patient has high fevers with negative blood cultures, suggesting a possible neoplastic, infectious, or rheumatologic cause. Enlarged mediastinal nodes may indicate lymphoma/myelodysplasia, adenocarcinoma of the lung or pancreas, squamous cell carcinoma, or a reactive process to infection.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has been given significant fluid resuscitation, and the serum creatinine level is now 1.6, down from 1.7. Pre-renal az"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old gentleman with a history of carcinoid lung CA s/p resection and no adjuvant chemo/XRT. He presents with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The assessment and plan indicate concerns for heme malignancy vs carcinoid ca recurrence, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARDS), fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, back pain, and a history of lung cancer. There are also recommendations for further evaluation and management of these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Severe sepsis or septic shock due to the ongoing fever and possible infectious etiology.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) exacerbation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure.
3. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) given the elevated ferritin levels.
4. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy due to medications such as vancomycin or argatroban.
5. Malignancy recurrence or progression, including carcinoid tumor recurrence or metastasis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer, who was admitted with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The patient's condition is concerning for hematologic malignancy, as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have ongoing hypoxemia, fever, and acute renal failure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with minimal changes since the previous radiograph. The patient has a positive D-dimer and low fibrinogen, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is worsening despite being on high levels of FiO2 and PEEP. This indicates ongoing hypoxemia and a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and worsening pulmonary infiltrates may suggest"

 worsening oxygenation attributable
   to bilateral PNA and mild volume overload requiring higher FiO2 and
   PEEP; esophageal balloon [**9-24**] showed under-PEEP'd by 2 cmH2O but not
   fully paralyzed during the study; Cx data neg to date
   - prefer low Vt ventilation with PIP<30
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated to maintain PO2 > 80, sat>92%

    #Acute renal failure
 nonoliguric; low UNa reflects pre-renal
   physiology perhaps from 3rd spacing and loss of intravascular volume
   - trend renal indices, UOP
   - avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   #Encephalopathy - CSF from [**9-17**] LP nondiagnostic with negative
   cytology, but cannot exclude malignancy unless have 3 neg large-volume
   taps & would therefore favor cisternal LP as per neuro recs to exclude
   this diagnosis; no data to date to confirm CSF infection
   -appreciate neuro recs
   -attempt MRI head & cisternal LP if stabilizes for transfer
   #HIT - plts cont to trend downward more likely due to underlying MDS or
   undiagnosed hematologic process; low fibrinogen & high FDP/d-dimer
   suggestive of DIC but would defer cryo therapy unless fibrinogen <200

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who was admitted with acute febrile illness, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, confusion/delirium, and anemia/leukocytosis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by ARDS. He has worsening oxygenation attributed to bilateral PNA and mild volume overload. The patient's condition includes fever, acute renal failure, encephalopathy, HIT, anemia, and potential sources of bleeding. The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, sedation, mechanical ventilation, and anticoagulation therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI): The patient's immunocompromised state and invasive lines increase the risk of developing a nosocomial BSI.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobilization and underlying malignancy can predispose the patient to DVT, which may lead to a potentially life-threatening PE.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing stress ulcers, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding"
